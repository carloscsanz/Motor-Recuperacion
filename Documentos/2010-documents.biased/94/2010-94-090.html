					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anybody want to review this game? It&#039;s definitely worth a review. I&#039;ll do a quickie:<br /><br />Gameplay 9/10<br /><br />The gameplay is one of the best I&#039;ve seen in a squad-based FPS, hell make that in any FPS. It makes you want to go back for more, and more and more. Its built-in online ranking system makes you want to climb the ranks and establish a presence among heroes. I&#039;ve had so many gaming moments when you just sit back and say &quot;wow&quot; at what just went on in front of you. Besides the having to learn how to pilot the heloes and aircrafts (and no, it isn&#039;t easy), most people can get right into it and if they have played a FPS shooter, they will do well. While rising in the ranks does have its advantages, any person with enough skill can overtake somebody with a much higher rank - like a private can still shoot a general. Having unlockables in the online feature is a drawback, but they do not give much of an advantage. They usually compensate for a better feature with another feature, such as the sniper rifle that has a longer zoom but is compensated with a longer reload. This game is amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;m too tired for more categories, so somebody make up a better review lol. Anybody play online? PM me and we&#039;ll start some matches.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just got that game and after several tries at the heleos I was ready to throw my mouse through the monitor. However, I loved the Co-pilot role for heleos much better with the tv-guided missles, awesome, some of those special effects for aircraft are really mind-blowing, and very realistic. Reminded me of the videos of guided missles from the Gulf War. Nice game so far.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes me and you will pair up nicely then scar... i am an ace pilot.... <br /><br />One time i landed the chopper at a flag point where artillery was falling on my teammates... they all crawled over, jumped in, and i got them outta there... artillery shells exploding all around us and my chopper at 50% armor  :o.  It was freaking wild. Having that HOTAS flightstick and throttle (the ones i posted pics of) really help tho.<br /><br />Get a good headset and download Teamspeak 2.  I will give you my Teamspeak IP address i use.  Its a teamspeak server that my EVE Corporation Alliance made.  The TS is a must cause its easier to communicate during battle and for telling each other what BF server to go to.  </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I played a few games last night with a squad leader actually using it to talk to members, it does tend to make you do things alot better. Although I was just listening and responding with keyboard, it still made a HUGE difference in the teamwork. Damn, finally at Lance Corp. just a few more kills.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yea I chose the special-ops unlock for strike at karkand, man that map is major close combat and brutal. I haven&#039;t tried medic but once, good thing about them is they keep ya spawning where you were and not 50 miles away, well if they are good at it. Favorite though is sniper unlock, a 7.5 mm rifle to a 50 cal. accurate as hell too...and really great for those hele pilots that like to just meander around and try to drop n snatch flags. instant death to hele and pilot if they just hover over it more than a sec or 2. <br /><br />Hey also Gun, I need to test this mic to see how it sounds to others, so it&#039;s not distorted or too loud etc. i&#039;ve yet to find someone to test it with. I&#039;ve got it all set up correct and all just not sure how it sounds on the recieving end.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve unlocked the medic, spec ops and sniper weapons. I like the spec ops weapon, but I&#039;m getting more used to the medic&#039;s. I love being a medic, especially in close quarters. I revived a guy three times in a row one time until he finally got the guy shooting him. I could imagine the grief on the other guy lol. There seems to be more unlocks for each class, like another tier of unlockables. </div>

One is&nbsp; first person,3rd person of the front, one is same from the back and also a fly-by type of view. Just think of the C key as a cycle through them all. I use that alot for vehicles also.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Played some last night and during one game after killing some high ranked dude, I took his kit and had this weapon....http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/screen000.jpg&nbsp; I think it is a F2000 but not sure. All I know is I killed like 50 during the time I had it. It is semi-full auto..the game was too intense at the time for me to stop and check out the name of it, but that will be the next unlock I get I hope, unless it is some SF unlock.

The nightime maps must kick ass... Nice rank there too btw.<br /><br /><br />I went ahead and unlocked the G3 this a.m. with the assault kit. Very nice, and accurate even without a scope to go with it. Question Rigel, is the Scar-L and flashbangs part of the expansion?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow I got pwned bad earlier from a flashbang. I was taking off from the airfield in a jet, just as I was hitting the afterburner for a fast takeoff at the end of the runway..bamm flash goes off and I was just airborne. I have no clue what direction or where I crashed at, but that was a nice little strat the guy used with those damn things.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It would be alot more balanced if they made those weapons only playable in the exp. game servers only.&nbsp; You can&#039;t join a server that is exp hosted but they can use those weapons in regular BF2 games..doesen&#039;t make much sense as far as balance goes.</div>

There are 2 icons when the game is installed, one says bf2 and the other is play bf2 online now. Don&#039;t try and register with the second just use the BF2 icon to play and register online. Now that I think about it, I never even use the play BF2 online now one at all. Unless there is a temp. server prob going on, it should register fine. Also you can check here http://bf2tracker.com/team.php to see if there are any current probs with server going. (rarely happens though) unless they are updating it or something.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate you guys! I was thinking of not getting a new game for at least a year (I bought Condition Zero in June this year) and now I too am feeling left out. This game seems cool even though I&#039;ve never touched anything in the battlefield series.<br /><br />And even if I did, it&#039;s kinda late now. The holidays are ending and I can&#039;t devote as much time to a new game since my A levels are next year :&#039;(<br /><br />Edit: After checking out a gamespot page on system requirements, I figured my computer would barely be able to handle a game. GeForce 5950 doesn&#039;t fare too well... let alone my GeForce FX 5200. Hmph. I might get the demo though.<br /><br />Edit: Hmph. My video card isn&#039;t even supported!</div>

I now have a 5500/256 which I got pretty cheap does just fine with the game, but it will work with a 5200/128 that I have tried already. Just can&#039;t play it on all high sets etc. is all.<br />I&#039;m aware what chipsets are supported, but i&#039;m also aware of what can be used to play it at medium sets just fine too.&nbsp; ;) So a GeForce 5950 should work fine.</div>

Then I found scar, helpful scar, who showed me how to click on multiplayer (or maybe it was becuase I killed my firewall) and it all started to work online.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A booster pack? Now what&#039;s that? It&#039;s not like the booster packs in Magic: The Gathering, right?<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;ve just tried the demo. The game is friggin&#039; awesome! The controls are a little complicated, but the game is just great! How I wish each round would last for 20 minutes instead of 10. Maybe I&#039;ll try Multiplayer later. On my GeForce FX 5200 and my 512MB RAM, the game seems to run pretty good on Low settings. However, I don&#039;t know if I can play 64-player maps :-\<br /><br />Edit: Heck, I can&#039;t get online, it doesn&#039;t let me create my accounts, say that some account using my email address/password is in use.<br /><br />Edit: Problem resolved, it seems someone is really using a password I was trying to use. When they say something is in use, do they refer to the email/password combination, or just the password actually being in use?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I found the sound files (zipped ?&nbsp; ???) and they are mostly .ogg files, which play fine in winamp.So it must be patch did something freaky...<br /><br />Have you tried to reinstall it cybodude ? Sounds like the registry part is missing, which lists the path of the game. Were you logged on as the same user who is trying to play the game. I am wondering if you had any issues when istalling, and whether its a permissions error...&nbsp; :o</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I decided to try host a local multiplayer game on gulf of oman (demo version, that&#039;s why) using the 32-player map and try some aircraft. Heck, I could pilot NOTHING. Every attempt just landed me in the water. Any idea how? My plane/helis just ended up twisting around and landing in the water.<br /><br />Edit: Ah, with some experimentation, I figured how to fly those things. The problem is... (especially with jets), how the hell do you land at the airfield? It hardly seems possible, and somehow I ended up losing thrust and went into the water, or going out of the map and getting punished. Will need more practice..</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It really does take practice and lots of it. I don&#039;t use a joystick for flying aircraft I use keyboard n mouse, but what I did was change the settings in options for aircraft like the yaw and pitch and sensitivity for mouse to high, it helped me alot. I&#039;m glad they made the aircraft a major learning curve to get good at. Cause when you think about it, it wouldn&#039;t be that balanced of a game if any noob could just get in one and obliterate with it all day. And when you think about the firepower they have it makes more sense that someone would have to actually learn and progress at getting better with them. I&nbsp; still am not that good with jets, but I love the attack heles now alot that i&#039;ve learned to fly them. Anyone who says they became great pilots in a day is just full o crap. :) Also, you don&#039;t really even have to land the jets in game, just fly over a friendly air field to re-load and repair. I haven&#039;t seen too many that actually land the jets.<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s a few screenys of the night maps with night vision, with n without the goggles...<br /><br />(http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/screen019.png)<br />(http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/screen020.jpg)<br />I played a few games online on these night maps, Needless to say, it is not easy at all to spot an kill the enemy. But this expansion is awesome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sigh, I&#039;m still using the demo. Doubt I can afford the time to play once school reopens in the new year.<br /><br />If only I had tried the demo much earlier! :-\<br />And it&#039;s not likely I&#039;ll use a headset to play either. I&#039;ll start behaving like a freak in front of my computer if I go shouting like hell to get over and help raise the flag or something. But the built-in voice commands are great and easy to use too.<br /><br />Oh well. Even if I do get the game, I wouldn&#039;t be getting the exp anytime soon - too much cost.<br />And somehow the demo doesn&#039;t have a chatroom function or something. No way a non-demo can play with a demo? :-\<br /><br />Edit: Oh, and I was playing 64 players (almost) on Gulf of Oman (I think it was the 32-player version, since the demo only comes with 16 and 32 player versions of Gulf of Oman), and those blasted MECs kept on using artillery and air strikes. I was running around reviving fallen team-mates, and had like 30+ deaths in like half an hour. So many people are that adept with jets?<br /><br />Edit: This is getting retarded. Going around with a jet and shooting stuff is cool, but I just can&#039;t seem to land the darn thing! Choppers are easier, but when it comes to landing on an aircraft carrier with limited space... it becomes almost impossible. I think I&#039;ll just remain a soldier and be fodder. Sigh.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just don&#039;t attempt to go beyond low graphic setts. If I remember, I could get mine to do medium graphics with that card, but it was really, really pushing it, and that was overclocked. You should be ok online but I wouldn&#039;t try entering the 64 plyr games. the others should be ok though (32 and below). Like I said before, it played fine online with me on all low setts. In the meantime start saving up for a better one, because the graphics on medium and high for the game are amazing to look at.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m now downloading the patch for BF2 v1.12 on gamershell (EA&#039;s site has horrible bandwidth). Does Special Forces need its own patch? Do I need the Special Forces disc to play Special Forces stuff, or will just either disc do the trick?<br /><br />Edit: Graphics cards are really expensive. I&#039;ll wait till prices drop. I&#039;m quite content with Low settings already. They are eye-popping :o<br />Edit: My game has crashed on several occasions with the demo, and just now I played Warlord map (SF) and it crashed after a few minutes, back to desktop with no error messages.

The crashes I dunno whats causing that, maybe try another driver or update.<br /><br /><br />Few screenys I did yesterday...<br /><br />(http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/screen026.png)<br /><br />Night vision ass kicking&nbsp; ;D<br />(http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/screen032.jpg)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have read in online forums that the 1.12 patch really can adversely affect game performance. At the moment, as far as I amaware, those that have that issue, have no workaround other then get a better gfx card&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I ran on high graphics settings offline and it was fine on my nVidia 6600GT, so when the game lags, its got to be an internet issue with me. I play on medium settings anyway online, like gunner said, they are eyepopping enough. Its just nice to have your eyes pop out even more :P<br /><br />Am currently practicing jet piloting (getting better, but landing is still out of the question, in fact the &quot;s&quot; key doesnt seem to slow it down a bit, and I am not one for manuals and stuff, so I guess another key is used to slow a plane down ? Or drag does it ?).<br /><br />Oh and spicy, I am like you, I wouldnt want a game with short term life, but this is so good, it will be expanded further and further, so it wont die out anytime soon.<br /><br />Hey, just noticed, I am a lance corporal at 100% ? wtf ?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ummm erjin how do you get around this:<br /><br /><i>&quot;While there are indeed places where you can download a file which allows you to play BF2 without the CD in the drive, I can&#039;t provide you with the details of where (due to legal reasons - so don&#039;t write and ask me for one). More importantly, even if I were to tell you where to download such a &#039;No-CD&#039; patch, it would be pointless to use one, since the Punkbuster cheat detection system in BF2 is likely to see this altered No-CD executable file as a cheat, booting you and eventually banning you permanently from playing BF2 multiplayer. Therefore I strongly recommend that you do not use any forms of No-CDs or other cracks, as this will lead to your unique CD key being banned without any recourse.&quot;</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah, yes, that was a tricky one :)<br /><br />I ignored it. or rather, I was ignorant of it. But that will not stop me from using the NoCD. I paid for the game, I have a legit serial. So why do they force me to keep my CD in the drive ? Also, I need to put others in the drive too, so I might leave BF2 out somewhere when changing and forget, or someone else might take it out to watch a DVD or something, and I might end up with no BF2 CD.<br /><br />That is another reason I like NoCD patches. I havent had any problems with not getting on and playing, or getting banned.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I thought it was pathetic, but I realised I was being paranoid. I later played on this USMC vs China map with lots of hills, and it was barely laggy. The FPS did not differ much from the demo either. It was a 32-player map. I&#039;m playing on custom settings, with 800x600 at 75hz (pathetic, I know, but the higher refresh rate doesn&#039;t worsen performance) and the distance thingy at 100% (so I have better eyesight in the game ;)).<br /><br />Yes, spicy, you have similar specs. In fact, it&#039;s the same except for the processor (mine&#039;s at 3.2ghz). You should be able to play 16 and 32-player maps with no difficulty (haven&#039;t tested Special Forces yet. Warlord seemed to be quite sticky), but if the video card seems to be too expensive, you can double your ram to 1gb (approx.) and see how it turns out. If not, getting a better video card doesn&#039;t do much harm. In fact, GeForce FX5200 isn&#039;t even supported, but yet you can play with it, which is quite odd. It&#039;s quite a controversial video card though, since some have claimed to pull off &#039;successful&#039; results with this card. You be the judge.<br /><br />Also, I do not play my games without anti-virus or firewall. I&#039;m a security freak, and I <b>always</b> keep them both, perhaps resulting in some memory conflicts. I also keep MSN running. I don&#039;t want to jeopardise security over performance, since the game is still playable by my standards (I&#039;m gonna upgrade eventually. Let&#039;s just watch the prices. Don&#039;t forget I don&#039;t even earn my own money yet ;)). However, reading some forums and reviews via Yahoo!, I figured the game is actually quite buggy in itself, and many people have had random crashes with no error messages whatsoever, particularly during the start-up of the game. I believe the patches should fix these.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, erjin999, but my performance seems to have <i>improved</i> with 1.12 patch ;)<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;ve gotten Teamspeak 2, and using a server search I&#039;ve found the LIH clan thing, but I can&#039;t get in.

I had 1 crash due the game being on for about 18 hrs. one weekend, but thats it.

I&#039;m a security freak, and I <b>always</b> keep them both, perhaps resulting in some memory conflicts.<br /></div><br />&quot;Not Supported&quot; is different from &quot;Wont Run On&quot;. Reading from what it says on the case, it seems it must have 128MB of RAM and support 1.4 Shaders. After that, you&#039;re ok.<br /><br />I always have Zonealarm and ESET&#039;s NOD32 running. Mostly becuase even if I did want to turn them off (which I dont) I would forget to before starting a game.<br /><br />I also have xFire to find out which server others playing are on (specifically Rewired at the moment) and TeamSpeak.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some excellent chopper tips I came across, and tips in general.<br /><br />Chopper Tips<br />By BustaCapTX<br /><br />Last Modified 08/10/05 12:14<br /><br />Some Transport Chopper Tips - When you get into a balanced helicopter squad with good communication (either text or VOIP - preferably voice) and a sense of purpose, there are few gaming experiences to equal BF2. When it works well, the teamwork involved makes it deeply satisfying.<br /><br />In transport helicopter situations, the best-balanced squads will include a good pilot, two door gunners (preferably one of them a support soldier), two engineers (to fix all but the most devastating damage to the aircraft) and a medic (to heal squad members who get wounded). Then get yourself into the air and go take over some enemy flags. The door gunners with their two 7.62mm cannons can wreak a lot of havoc on ground forces and vehicles, and everyone in the squad gets points for every kill they make.<br /><br />Some feel that helicopter flag-capping (flying from control point to control point taking over flags) is cheap, but I disagree. It can be a risky proposition (flying over enemy territory teeming with ground forces and AA vehicles, all trying desperately to bring you down in flames), and without the right complement of squad members, it&#039;s much, much harder. But done right, there are very few more effective ways to rack up points and help ensure victory.<br /><br />This is where teamwork comes into play. The medics will heal anyone aboard with no effort, but it&#039;s the engineers who save the day here. In heavy-fire situations, both engineers should be in the rear of the chopper with their wrenches in hand. When the chopper takes damage, they will automatically begin to repair it if the players point their wrench at the floor and simply hold down their left mouse button (sometimes it takes a little swivelling about to find the right spot where the repairs actually work). And the engineers should keep those mouse buttons pressed down until the helo is no longer taking fire. Another good engineer trick is to mine areas near the enemy&#039;s headquarters. While one remains on repair duty, the other can toss mines out over the side. Since you have a support soldier along, you&#039;ll be reloaded automatically, so don&#039;t hesitate to lay down a thick spread of mines near the enemy&#039;s base and flags, and especially on any road choke points (bridges and or canyon roads) near their stronghold. Mining from the air is particularly effective on or near any runways they have; if you can keep them out of the sky, you can assure air superiority, which makes victory that much easier.<br /><br />Door gunners should NOT simply shoot continuously until the gun overheats and stops firing; until it cools down (8-10 seconds) the chopper have no covering fire on that side. Instead, fire in 3-5 second bursts, with a second or so pause in between to cool the gun a bit. Other squad members should keep an eye on the &quot;manned positions&quot; indicator of the chopper; if a gunner (or the pilot for that matter) gets killed, they should be prepared to take over immediately.<br /><br />This is another reason why good commo is essential, if you get killed, let your squad know. A good amount of chatter can keep you alive and in the air longer (&quot;Enemy AA vehicle on the road to our left!&quot; &quot;Sniper on the roof!&quot; &quot;There&#039;s a bunch of grunts behind trying to flank us!&quot;), and increase the scores for everyone. Even squad members without a microphone should have VOIP enabled (in the Audio Options) so they can at least hear what their squad is saying.<br /><br />Instead of flying into a fight straight on, pilots should angle their approach to give their gunners a better chance to take out ground threats. They cannot shoot directly in front of the aircraft, but have a nice fat field of fire on the sides. Pilots, USE this to your advantage and let your gunners help you out.<br /><br />Everyone else, just hang on to your posteriors and keep and eye out for enemy threats, especially hostile attack choppers. These are your worst enemy. Try to stay above them; altitude is your friend.<br /><br />An Anti-tank soldier can sometimes get a AT good shot off from the door of a chopper, but the gunship has to be flying steady. Most vehicles are lightly armored on top and in the rear ... your prime target if you choose to helo-snipe with your rockets. Press and hold the fire button while tracking the vehicle with your sight; keep it right on him. Again, this can sometimes be effective since the support guy will automatically reload you.<br /><br />Final note - A surprising number of people don&#039;t know this very basic fact: when you&#039;re in a squad, select the green dot on the respawn screen.<br /><br />This is your squad leader. When you come back to life, you&#039;ll respawn near him and in any vehicle he&#039;s in that has an unmanned position. If the green dot has a red ring around it, the squad leader is either dead or in a full vehicle. Wait a few seconds to see if he comes back to life and respawn on him once he does. If he&#039;s in a vehicle (the red-circled green dot is moving), you&#039;ll have to choose another respawn point. But once you die, try to select the green dot again. Members of a team can&#039;t really help each other if they aren&#039;t near each other.<br /><br />Happy flying. Now go raise some Hell!! HOO-rah!<br /><br /><br />Figured I would throw in a tip of my own here, a way to keep Erjin alive as well :P. When in combat and you see your sqaud medic go down, be nice and go pick up his kit then revive him. Then go get your original kit back (press g to pick up a kit). I even forget sometimes how simple that is to do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy, are you also deathand ?&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I dont think its possible to lag properly in this game :P as it auto kicks laggers, I know, I have been mostly playing on servers in America and the lag is higer then the players who are local, so I have been kicked (once only... mind :)).<br /><br />SF can be played either on SF only maps with SF weapons, or they can play on normal BF2 maps. They can bring their weapons back to normal games. It is a backward compatible extension, where BF2 isnt forward compatible.<br /><br />Does that make it unbalnced ? Hell yeah, when I am being killed by some noob (probably) with a BFG...well, I exaggerate a bit. But I believe, like many others I think, that this is an example of excellent marketing by EA (also, excellent way of shafting customers :P). Buy SF or you WILL be at a disadvantage.<br /><br />But, having said all that, I dont care, cos its stil a damn good fun game. For £20, what more could I ask for ? Only worried that the SF pack costs only £5 less then the game :(</div>

The lows: new vehicles aren&#039;t very new or interesting, new maps are very buggy.<br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend getting the expansion right now unless if you&#039;ve just got money to blow or you REALLY need to gain ranks fast. *cough* erjin *cough*</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;lag in fps&nbsp; is silly..&nbsp; because its impossible to see what u shoot.. and i hate to see a prety<br />&nbsp;game like this go to waste because of peapol bad setup.. i mean i saw few slow games in there<br />&nbsp;it cant be me slowing them down because i had very fast games as well.. that is what i meant in some of my posts befor that as mutch as we like emp but we have to live on.. and we cant wait 7 years behind..<br />&nbsp;this new system of automaticly kicking laggers is the answer.. thats why i needed to asking u guys<br />&nbsp;if i was going to lag or not.. because its not nessary to buy the game if i know from now<br />&nbsp;its gonna lag.. and am not planing to any cards upgread atm&nbsp; . worst thing i saw peapol trying to fly fighter jests when the game is slow or lagging its realy a bad sight..totaly deffrent from<br />&nbsp;the cool feeling u get when u see it flying above ure head at sonic speed&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; best thing i like&nbsp; the 3 weels buggy car... ;D too fast even for a helicoper to catch..<br />&nbsp; i make the anemy crazy with it .. like i never fight i just drive around and snatch those flags down like a laundry thief. then go and drink driving again&nbsp; hahahaa ::)</div>

I&#039;ll be on tomorrow, but give me some time to figure all the EST thing out (I don&#039;t know what EST is supposed to mean, or it&#039;s difference with GST +8.00, which I have here). But yeah, this is Singapore, only about 2 or 3 servers have a ping of about 100, the rest stay at 200+, and the loading time is about 20 seconds for me (usually less, 20 seconds is the max), but VERIFYING CLIENT DATA is the part that takes forever, sometimes 20 seconds too, sometimes just 10 seconds, sometimes a minute. And so I enter the game with the ticket ratios and spawn points all haywire because the game started like a minute ago :&#039;(<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I can play with you guys since I&#039;m in Singapore and the ping will be astronomical. I&#039;m using xFire (hey erjin, it&#039;s friggin&#039; great stuff!) with nickname <b>rotlung</b> (who the hell took gunner154?), so add me or something and we&#039;ll see :)<br /><br />Oh, and you can practise flying by creating a Local server. You&#039;ll be the only one in there, and the game is pretty stable.<br /><br />My demo has crashed several times, but for the actual game only Special Forces has crashed once.. and that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />And from what I know you cannot join regular BF2 games if you&#039;re playing Special Forces. You have to load the regular Battlefield 2 mod first. And each faction in SF2 has its own weapons (I think?) like the flashbangs, ziplines and stuff, but I think most can be unlocked on regular BF2 I think, is it? I got Special Forces 2 but haven&#039;t tried it online because I couldn&#039;t find a happy server. Fortunately there is ONE Singaporean server for BF2 which is full most of the time, but I get &gt;50 ping when I play on it ;D</div>

Have to have SF to play the new maps and new houses it has.<br />The weapons from SF you can use to play reg. BF2.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I doubt that. I am sure the server tells your computer game that you have recieved a promotion. That infos on the server, otherwise clever types would exploit the fact its on your computer and try to get free promos...<br /><br />Also, yeah, xFire is cool. Launching into a game server a friend is playing on with just one click, hehe. Also, typing to each other when necessary in game is cool.<br /><br />By the way, have you guys disabled the movies ? Do a search in the game folder for *.bik and rename:<br /><br />Dice.bik<br />EA.bik<br />Legal.bik<br />intro.bik<br /><br />And get faster load times.<br /><br />I found a patch for blood and gore, but I havent tried it yet.

Hopefully I&#039;ll be fit enough to actually shoot someone (rather than relying on artillery for my kills).<br /><br />Somehow, I&#039;m always dying too often. Well, yeah that&#039;s because I suck at the game. But more often than not, I find myself running around, sometimes with my squad leader and healing him occasionally, and all of a sudden someone hit me with something and I died instantly, without knowing how the hell I died, which I why I always top my team in terms of death count, and often with zero kills (and yet a score for healing and reviving ;)) Looks like I have to stop playing this game Counterstrike-style.</div>

Although some servers hate it and put in thier rules not to use it,(which is retarded since it&#039;s not accurate at all and does take some aiming skills), if it&#039;s included in my kit I use it. Same for claymores. But instead on placing claymores just on top of ladders now, I use them on city maps alot when I play sniper. Like if I&#039;m being chased, run around a corner drop a claymore keep running...boom guy runs into it. The bad thing about them is it causes alot of acc. teamkills, then some doof chooses to punish you because they didnt pay attention to your placement of them.<br /><br />And yea, thats true about throwing&nbsp; grenades further.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Apparently you lose about 9 points for a punish, and it means you get ranked up slower, becuase that percentage bar you see in the sigs is increased by the points in game. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh no, the Euro&#039;s are coming.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br />http://www.ea.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/home.jsp<br />Community Update 1/11/06<br /><br />Hello everyone and a Happy New Year to all of you.<br /><br />Today we have some big announcements that were excited to share with you! First of all, news about 2 new booster packs that will expand the battlefields of Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2: Euro Force and Battlefield 2: Armored Fury.<br /><br />Euro Force will be released on February 8th and sees the introduction of the all-new European Army in 3 new maps. Each Euro soldier will come equipped with a new primary weapon, from the FNP90 to the Benelli Tactical Shotgun. There will also be 4 new vehicles, including the (in)famous Eurofighter. The 3 maps are Operation Smoke Screen, The Great Wall of China and Taraba Quarry.<br /><br />Armored Fury will be released on March 28th and the focus is on large mechanized battles, harking back to the El Alamein style maps on BF1942. There will be 3 new maps  Midnight Sun, Operation Harvest and Operation Road Rage  but also 2 new vehicle classes. Attack Jets and Recon Helicopters, which can spot nearby enemy units, will make their debut.<br /><br />Both packs will be available exclusively online at www.downloader.ea.com at $9.99 each (9.99 in Europe and £5.99 in the UK).<br /><br />As well as these booster packs, we are of course still utterly devoted to providing updates to Battlefield 2. We cant say it enough; thank you all for your support and dedication! Update 1.2 is currently undergoing public beta testing and will be released very soon. As with the first list, this second list includes confirmed fixes only:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Helicopter now carry 8 missiles rather than 14<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * TV-Guided missile now have a shorter range<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Hit points on all air vehicles has been reduced<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * AA missile lock has been improved<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Support kits have had their primary weapons adjusted for accuracy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Sniper kits have had their primary weapons adjusted for accuracy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Anti-Tank kits have had their primary weapons adjusted for accuracy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * &quot;Dolphin Diving&quot; is no longer possible&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Players can no longer jump and shoot at the same time{....Haha, so long bunny-hoppers. Nothing pisses me off more than getting killed by someone jumping around 6ft. in the air and shooting around randomly at you. ;D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * &quot;Prone Spamming&quot; is now fixed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * &quot;Sprint exploit&quot; is now fixed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The Sa80 weapon has been improved<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The G3A3 weapon has been improved<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Reload while sprinting has been enabled<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Chinese and MEC APCs can now shoot through penetrable materials<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Damage decreased for the M134<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Medic defibrillator paddles have been adjusted. They now reload while not in use.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Server search filters now work properly<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * All mines (Claymore, Anti-vehicle, C4) can now be picked up by the same class that dropped it by using the G key.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Mines can no longer be destroyed with other explosives<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Flash bang effect radius decreased&nbsp; &nbsp; {Boooo!}.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Added unlocks for Sniper and AT kits<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed a bug in terrain rendering with night vision, whereby terrain was still dark in dark areas.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed a bug whereby mods that are not bf2 or not xpack permutate shaders every time a level is loaded.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed a bug whereby non-xpack mods cannot use xpack shaders.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed bug in TV guided missiles of Havoc helicopter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Bug in MP7 fire rate fixed. Ammo count increased and mag count and damage decreased<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * APC Update  Chinese and MEC APCs can now shoot through penetrable materials. This fix was a miscommunication to the patch team. Chinese and MEC APCs have been reverted and the LAV25 now no longer shoots through penetrable materials.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Vehicles no longer disappear when viewed from some vehicles with a HUD (e.g. Tanks).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Performance gain found in static mesh rendering.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Detonation radius from grenade launcher explosions has been reduced.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Grenade launcher projectiles now have a minimum time before arming.<br /><br /><br /><br />As always, thanks for your support and keep talking  were listening.<br /><br />Your friends at EA and DICE</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds good. Do those packs rely in any way on SF2 ? And how many people will get them, is it like SF2 where you can only play with others with the packs...? I suppose its only the maps that require every player to have their own copy of the exansion pack.</div>

I suppose its only the maps that require every player to have their own copy of the exansion pack.<br /></div><br />WEll, SF is pretty much a game by itself and the booster packs are made for the original BF2 vanilla version as a patch fix I think. <br />It shows the blue &quot;2&quot; on the website so I would think it&#039;s gonna be like SF where there will be that icon in the server list and you have to have it as well to play with others. But I don&#039;t believe you have to have SF at all to play and/or install it.</div>

I guess my router knows its making an outbound connection and allows it in.<br /><br />As for joysticks, well, I cant imagine playing BF2 with a joystick, except for the plane, which probabyl would be better with a joystick. But walking around, ducking, jumping, shooting...isnt that easier with a mouse/KB combo ?<br /><br />I havent ever owned a joystick for about 15 years, so couldnt tell you how to use one&nbsp; with BF2 :(</div>

Someone correct me if you feel I am wrong, but I reckon its ok to just know where you need to be putting the bullets and what the maps called :P<br /><br />This game is good for practising the weapons or vehicles offline, but the real fun is online.<br /><br />So yeah, no campaing, just choose the map, its tells you whats happened (MEC [Middle East Coallition) are defending against attacking USMC [United States Marine Corps] forces). So you might be launching off an Air Craft Carrier.<br /><br />Thats it, as an example...</div>

This prevents there being any aircraft beyond helos. It&#039;s sole purpose is to get used to the gameplay, and some of the maps.<br /><br />There is a ranking structure, however, so basically your military career is the plotline.</div>

Even BF2 uses just under 1 gig when you play with textures on high. Before you get a new sound card which you don&#039;t need, buy a new GFX card or if you don&#039;t have enough just sell some of your ram of which you have plenty.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Would be graphics card issue, if &quot;upping&quot; the graphics card results in lag.<br /><br />Also, better to get AMD for gaming, I think it is tomshardwareguide, or anandtech, where they did a comparison, and AMD whooped Intel big time.<br /><br />I can play with most settings on medium or high (but not antialising, hell no) without lag. I think the graphics are fine on medium, and I get my lag from bad connections (either the server is far from me or someone else and the ping times are stupid, like 200+&nbsp; :().<br /><br />I got 1 Gig of RAM and I find that when I minimise to windows, the page file has been used to store my desktop and any programs I had open and it takes a good few seconds to load em up again. Also, extra RAM virtually never hurts in a game.<br /><br />My computer lags intermittently on Emperor: Battle for Dune, a bit, but runs fine on BF2&nbsp; ??? Go figure, eh ?<br /><br />I have: <br /><br />AMD 64 4000+<br />1Gig Dual Channel Memory<br />6600GT 128MBGfx<br />Onboard Creative sound card<br />4Megs down, 387kb up<br /><br />Recommendation to avoid lag is to be happy with medium settings, or fork out for a nice expensive graphics card. I chose the first option :P and am happy.</div>

My 6600 GT can run the vision blur much better than my old 5500 could but there is still the framerate drop, its hardly noticable but its still there. Don&#039;t sweat it too much though, since my upgrade I haven&#039;t died as a direct result of the lag, and now that I&#039;ve been thinking about it I realize its a very trivial issue, not really worth mentioning but its always good to know the pros and cons of buying new (and expensive) hardware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Frankly, from my experience so far, the biggest devil in BF2 is bandwidth lag, not game lag. With my crappy computer I&#039;m rather happy to be on Low settings. It&#039;s still playable, though killing gets a bit difficult sometimes (especially when in several of my experiences the enemy just bunny-hops like hell till I die. Glad they&#039;re fixing that soon! :D :D). However, it&#039;s the bandwidth problem that&#039;s the REAL problem. Sometimes if it&#039;s so bad, running into a building for cover can become difficult as you find yourself unable to get into the building because of lag, and causing you to die an unjustified death.<br /><br />So fix the modem. I can only play on less than 1% of the servers, but I just play there often. Of course, I have to compromise if I want to play with scar or erjin...<br /><br />And PLEASE get Xfire! It&#039;s real good. I&#039;m not sure how you can add me, but I guess you try adding <i>rotlung</i> and see if it works. If not, try <i>gunner154</i>. The problem is some guy took gunner154 for no particular reason (he didn&#039;t take 153 nor 155, but 154!), so I registered <i>rotlung</i> and changed my nickname (not username). See if that works. It&#039;s good software.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess i&#039;m lucky then. I don&#039;t experience much if any lag at all. All my sets are on low and even some sound options I turn down lower, I mean I really don&#039;t need to hear the effects of an artillary strike hitting me in ultra stereo quality do I? The 5500 is basically a 5200 with more ddr. As long as I can see the enemy nice n clear,smooth gameplay i&#039;m happy. But I am getting a better card soon,game runs fine for me so far. </div>

BUT that DOESNT mean you dont need an SLI dual videocard setup.&nbsp; Its apples and oranges.&nbsp; Whether a game is single threaded makes no difference when referring to using SLI.&nbsp; I am not stupid.... i bought a single core processor because i knew that a second CPU would not give anymore gaming performance but SLI makes the two graphics card work together regardless of whether a game is single threaded.&nbsp; This tells me you didnt even understand the list of components i posted above when talking about my computer... you either thought that i had bought two CPU&#039;s... or you thought that two GPU&#039;s i bought were incompatible with single threaded games like two CPU&#039;s would be..... either case you were wrong.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />This is blatantly evident in that the Voodoo2 card which is an ancient ancient card (about 15 years old or more) was a dual GPU graphics card.&nbsp; And of course all games back then were single threaded.&nbsp; <br /><br />So stick to what you are good at... whatever it is.&nbsp; But please dont try jumping into tech conversations when you think&nbsp; &quot;Buying bleeding edge from Alienware&quot; is something fantastic....bleeding edge from alienware isnt even bleeding edge ffs.&nbsp; I want to play games in max detail at max performance, and i am doing it in an affordable way... meaning i am not helping to pay the mortgage on the Alienware&#039;s president&#039;s Mansion. <br /><br />As far as 50% margins only in the 1980&#039;s... please.... there are plenty of people waiting to rip off suckers everyday like you, even in 2006.... you probably pay 20-30 bucks for an oil change when the 5 liters of oil they are using is only worth 5 bucks total....and it would take you 5 minutes to do it yourself.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />Bottom line:..... Buying a high performance computer online or at a store is usually a ripoff <i>(you should build it yourself.... anyone who knows what they are talking about will agree with me here)</i>..... and two graphics cards will greatly increase performance on games <i>(regardless of the fact that they are single threaded)</i>&nbsp; <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Gunwounds<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To clear up the situtation even more.... here is a clearer explanation about using two video cards (GPU&#039;s)<br /><br />(http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6156/image0110lr.png)<br /><br />basically this shows twice the frames with the SLI.&nbsp;94 frames vs 53.5 frames.&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is what you would expect.&nbsp; The great thing is that the 94 frames (double) are achieved in maxxed out 4xAA 8xAF and 1600 x 1200 resolution which means a hell of alot more than if you were just doubling frames in say 640 x480 reoslution with low detail.&nbsp; I cant wait to see what BF2 looks like when in that maxxed out mode as well as the other games i play... including F.E.A.R. which i want to pick up soon.<br /><br /><br />Also wanted to note that building a &quot;bleeding edge&quot; computer doesnt mean you must do it every 3 months like ps501 suggests... it means if you build a nice one it can last you a long time.... i kept my old 3ghz system (it was bleeding edge back then) for 2+ years now before deciding to upgrade recently.&nbsp; Its usually the people who buy cheap budgety crap that often upgrade every 3 months because they are constantly unhappy with the poor performance their budgety system provides.&nbsp; Whereas people who build awesome computers computers to begin with often keep them for years.&nbsp; I usually keep my comps for 2+ years or more because thats how long it takes for software developers to come out with games advanced enough to challenge the systems i build for myself.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; Hi, as i stick to this thread topic wich is the&nbsp; review of bf2 pc game... i am starting to see the bad part of this game.... i mean comon guys this game was not made for the usual home pc users<br />&nbsp;just listen to this( ;D) :<br />quoted from game spy bf2 review page 4: <br /><br />But the biggest complaint that we have with the game is the steep hardware requirements. You&#039;ll need a beefy video card: the minimum is a GeForce FX 5700 or a Radeon 8500. If you don&#039;t have the proper card, or the proper driver, the game dumps you unceremoniously to desktop without as much as an error message. We&#039;ve got machines here at GameSpy with GeForce Ti 4600s that are capable of running Half-Life 2 or DOOM 3 with solid framerates, but Battlefield 2 won&#039;t even run on these systems. It seems that a huge audience could find themselves shut out of this game, which is a shame; if you&#039;ve been looking for a good excuse to pick up a new video card, this might be it.<br /><br />comments:(the game wont run on game spy game testing pcs !) so what do u expect from the ordinary peapol????<br /><br />&nbsp;i was just reading a post at emp forum about a guy who think emp is running slow on his pc and belive it or not he got an 11 mb vga (hahaa i got more memory on my mobile vedio chip)...<br /><br />&nbsp;i mean its way too far to ask for a preformance geforce 5700fx 256mb as minimum...<br />&nbsp;even 256k adsl is a jock as a connection i keep getting the connection lag screen with the 16 players demo map!!<br />peapol out there are making a mess with this game . i see the players disconnecting line&nbsp; evrey 5 secound of the game... and the ping punisher kicking line every 3 (just befor i get kicked my self)<br />99%&nbsp; of the peapol arnt ready for the gunwounding&nbsp; electronical&nbsp; monsters.. or the erjinical&nbsp; wisdom.. or the scarcology&nbsp; abilityes in the world of computers..<br />most of users&nbsp; are just normal (non ritch) peapol or even younger guys who take money from there parents, and trying to have some good time, we dont have 1000$ of cach, or enough Elearning to face up with this nasa project(bf2).<br />i admit the game is 100% perfect.. but haw many peapol in the 5000000 on line players have perfect pc?&nbsp; i think less than 3% and the rest are laggers.. so even if you are ritch enough to playe<br />bf2..&nbsp; i am sure that the rest of the players in the server will playe a good role in slowing u down and making ure monster pc lag as well... just befor they get disconnected..then other laggers will hop in. i know this is a long post but i am angree . i belive i should have been at least able to playe this game at minimum settings with my new 1000$ cost system.. but the truth is i cant.<br />even if i could my 256k adsl is not good enough to join the servers i want to playe in, with the peapol i know..<br />my (16 players map&nbsp; demo) game usaly end after few secounds with a ping kicker or a crach to desktop.<br />&nbsp;so i will sadly dump this game..or maybe i will use the 50$ nessaery to buy this game to replace the 5200fx&nbsp; vga that this game wont accept.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Guess what? I find myself waiting for as long as 15 minutes on occasion for either of the 2 Singaporean servers to have space for me to join. They are full most of the time. The problem is not always with your connection. Playing with others can often be very stable, and sometimes it&#039;s not. It depends on your location. I can try joining a game scar is in, only to get kicked out in less than a minute. Guess what? He&#039;s almost at the other side of the planet! I&#039;m better off sticking with Singaporean servers, or joining a server to compromise (the server on which I first played with erjin and scar seemed good. It&#039;s a compromise made by all 3 parties, each from a different location altogether).<br /><br />However, 256 IS too slow, heck, it&#039;s not even a decent connection for online gaming these days. Perhaps it&#039;s fine for Emperor. But for things like Warcraft III or even Counterstrike, I fear not, especially if you intend to play with people from other countries as well.<br /><br />As for the hardware problems, it really depends. I&#039;m happy with Low settings right now. It looks marvellous on that, and having upgraded my RAM from 512Mb to 1 gig, it has helped a lot in reducing the lock-ups that I experience at the start of every game. Heck, I HAVEN&#039;T experienced a lock-up since doubling my RAM, yet get it every game in the first 5 minutes of it (lock-ups rarely happen after that). See the improvement 512mb RAM can make? And 512mb is quite cheap, and is useful if you intend to wait for graphic card prices to drop. My game hasn&#039;t crashed either, except for once when it screwed up my resolution and colours (but it happened just once anyway, and was probably due to a memory conflict for that matter).<br />True, you might not get the best out of the game with budget systems, but you can definitely play even 32-player maps with it. It might be harder to play 64-player maps with it, but if you are mainly support classes, like Medics, you can fight less and yet score much. I once hit more than 25 points in one game, yet killing only two players in that round. Why? I healed numerous players, and revived many too. My teamwork score was grossly high that round. I was proud of myself for sure :)<br /><br />Thus, the problem isn&#039;t as bad as you&#039;d described it, deatHand.<br /><br />Edit: On another note, during that best round of mine, I was actually on Wake Island 2007, which is a 64-player map. Who says you can&#039;t enjoy the game? ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1.) Numerous maps have aircraft of all sorts. I don&#039;t know which is the F15, but heck, if you get the retail version, some 16-player maps have aircraft too, though I&#039;m not sure about the jets part. 32-player maps DO have aircraft. Lots of them do. Try Operation Clean Sweep (retail) or even Gulf of Oman!<br /><br />3.) It doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t upgrade it in future.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy that&#039;s kinda silly when you think about it,I mean I am playing with bare min. specs right now and have been. Also, about the servers I know&nbsp; the ones your complaining about, they are called unranked take what you get,crap servers. The ranked ones are much more choosy in terms of ping,rules,size etc. and yes it makes a huge difference. I mean dunno what the rest are bringing up but I can choose through around 4 or 5 thousand servers on any given day. And those are the populated ones and ranked. Also, I don&#039;t think your patched and updated like the rest that makes a difference as well.<br /><br />The specs,well I mean damn man,the game has sys. specs like any other game. Chances are if you don&#039;t meet those req&#039;s. then you will run into some problems.<br /><br />The planes you can fly on the empty 64 plyr maps online, thats not gonna lag much when your the only one in there, I do it all the time for flying practice. There are tons of empty servers available for flying at any time. Btw, flying jets and heles are gonna kinda suck with a 5200, especially when you try to use the guided-missles.Thats why I had to do a mini upgrade to a 5500.<br />But i&#039;m now getting something a little more beefy for the game for better graphics. I mean even the 5500 is under sys. spec req. but playable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven&#039;t even played the demo before, but from what i&#039;ve read it&#039;s just Gulf of Oman with a 12 min. time limit. If and when you ever try the real version with all the little extras, i&#039;m sure you would see a difference, but the game doesen&#039;t appeal to everyone either I guess. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For your information, the demo has no patch. Thus, you only need to get the demo and you can play online. Most servers have overcome the problem of 12-min time limit anyway, and you can overcome the 10-min singleplayer time limit easily. The 32-player version is only available for online play. You cannot progress in the demo, so no rankings, no unlocks (though it&#039;s possible to hack the game to get all unlocks to play in the demo). The problem is that most servers cram 64 players into 32-player Gulf of Oman, which makes gameplay rather unenjoyable because you tend to die in less than 5 minutes after respawning due to air strikes.<br /><br />That&#039;s why the demo is a lot less enjoyable than the retail.<br /><br />Many players can fly jets decently well even on 32-player maps. And no, you cannot cover Gulf of Oman 32-player with an F15 in 3 seconds. It does take a while, especially if you start off from the aircraft carrier. There is a reasonable amount of airspace, and thus dogfights can still occur, and so can bombings.<br />Anyway, we respect your decision not to get the game. I know how bad it sucks not to have an Egyptian server. I wouldn&#039;t enjoy my games if the only 2-3 Singaporean servers didn&#039;t exist either.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Oh man !</b> I played late last night, even though I had to go work the next morning, just so I could get ranked (couldnt wait). And I passed the Global Score of 2500 points needed to get Sergeant, but nothing happened. I really want to unlock the Special Ops upgrade weapon, but it isnt acknowledging I am due a promotion, even though you can see my sig says I am at 100%, and I am above the 2500 points now (2560+).<br /><br />Damn stoopid servers not serving me my promotion. I am going to defect :P<br /><br /><b>Spicy</b>, I totally sympathise with you. Sometimes I get stoopid ping times, like &lt;15..and other times, well I think the 1023 was a bit off :P It wasnt even lagging, maybe thats like the Emp 1000 ping, showing that it cannot detect.<br /><br />But I joined scar and co on one American server, which I kept getting kicked from for high ping, fair enough. but it was annoying, there I am, having done a decent kill (and those who know my play know thats a special thing ;)) and am capturing the flag, great ! Points !, and then get kicked, disconnected. That is very annoying, time after time. I had to play with Europeans after that&nbsp; :&#039;( hehe.<br /><br />I think if you havent tried, set everything to minimum, make sure all background processes are stopped, heck, stop everything, including stuff you dont need, like Print Spooler and stuff. Are there no servers even in the Middle East ? I accept Iraq and Afghanistan might not have any right now, but what about Isreal ? UAE ? Turkey ? Saudia Arabia ? Europe, even ?<br /><br />It sounds like a closer connection might help. New servers must be popping up often enough. I usually search for about 200-300 servers, then sort by ping, then find ones with lowest ping that has a good number of players.<br /><br /><b>Cybodude</b>, aim the defilingy at the body, either standing or lying down. Just use the crosshair to &quot;shoot&quot; the dying guy.<br /><br />By the way, whats a ten - 10 - ten ? is that another way of saying tomatoe tomato ?</div>

This darn thing is faulty.<br /><br />Regarding the defilibrator (can&#039;t spell that thing): It&#039;s preferable you aim at the chest, but normally as long as you aim at some part of his body, you&#039;ll revive him. It&#039;s good if you prone and do it to maximise accuracy. Sometimes, it fails, and that&#039;s mainly because the person who is to be revived must NOT be viewing the Kit or Squad screens if he is to be revived. If you try to revive him and he happens to be picking his next Kit, you&#039;ll fail. Keep trying until the body disappears. It&#039;s not likely he&#039;ll be staring at the map or something for the whole 15 seconds.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been viewing the other screens when revived. Quite a shock (realistic, I suppose :P) to be revived, I didnt expect it and started to change respawn point.<br /><br />So I am not sure about the times it fails. I know I have tried many times to revive someone not revivable, such as those who are hit by artillary on the head. Blap. No coming back from that one way street :&gt;.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, thats what I meant by the artillary strike. You know when you are really dead, the monitor shows you the view of the area surrounding your dead body, rather then the view you would get if you were stil inside your body.<br /><br />If you dead, you get a out-of-body experience. The medics can tell, because you dont have a heart symbol over your body, and you dont show up on the minimap as a symbol. Only I dont sometimes look, and just run around trying to revive anyone/thing, even the enemy (arent doctors meant to save lives, even if they are the enemy ? I realise I am not a doc, but a medic, but hey, I want the points. Of course, some bugger [me ;)] would kill, revive, kill, revive... :P</div>

Usually artillary hits you when the flag is around halfway.<br /><br />The end result is usually something like this...<br />http://bf2tracker.com/gallery.php?action=viewpic&amp;picture=16987</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After learning how to aim the grenade launcher accurately on empty servers (standing next to a supply crate just launching them into things lol), I&#039;ve grown to like assault a lot more than before. The armor plus decent weapons make a very nice point-gainer.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also discovered a couple things:<br /><br />It takes 5 shells to blow a helo.<br />It takes one shot to blow a buggy.<br />It takes one shot to blow that more modern version of the fast vehicle in BF2.<br />It takes 5-6 shots to blow an apv.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve also discovered something strange, it might be a glitch or might just be that server: try shooting the grenade launcher directly at your feet. You won&#039;t die. What&#039;s more interesting is that anything around or behind you will. I tried this with a supply crate and it blew up but I didn&#039;t. I did it over and over and the worst effect from it was the ringing in the ears.<br /><br />Check it out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">EA added some more confirmed additions to the patch, here they are in detail...<br /><br />Community Update - 1/18/06<br /><br />Listen up Soldiers!<br /><br />By now, you have all seen the list of fixes in the next update (1.2). We are still trying to nail down a few final items and put the final touches in place.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a list of additional items to look for in version 1.2:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * UAVs are now visible in the world so if you are being scanned, you can know about it and take action against it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Rank progression is no longer limited to the enlisted ranks. All officer ranks are now available.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Bug that allowed players in vehicles to contest a flag from outside the flag radius is now fixed.<br /><br />Id also like to take this opportunity to clarify some confusion stemming from our updates.<br /><br />The first item is on the topic of grenades. Players will still be able to toss grenades while jumping. Although the ability to fire while jumping has been removed, players will still be able to initiate a grenade toss prior to jumping and follow through with the toss, thereby gaining themselves some extra distance. We understand that there will be some adjustment in tactics required when the patch comes out but we are confident that the community will quickly come to grips with the new tactics.<br /><br />The second item is on the topic of the booster packs. We have not created the maps as a separate expansion pack requiring a separate server. The booster packs will increase the content of the base game and thereby may be run on a server in regular rotation with the original maps.<br /><br />Hope that clears up some of questions youve all been asking.<br /><br />[EA]Mike and the rest of the Battlefield Team<br /><br /><br />I have no probs with it so far, at least EA is listening to feedback on BF2 and actually doing something about it. :)<br /><br />Also found 3 small movie clips of the new unlocks, and some new fixes for the game, actually being done in-game.<br /><br />http://www.unionen.se/pub/BF2se_-_1.2_alpha.rar&nbsp; Open using Winrar, this one shows the new and improved grenade-launcher,heles,c4,AA turrets and the UAV flying around.<br /><br />http://s147829439.onlinehome.fr/bf2/p90.wmv<br /><br />http://s147829439.onlinehome.fr/bf2/l96a1.wmv</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Err, wait. You&#039;re right. I&#039;ve forgotten what the irritating advertisement that appears when you log in says.<br /><br />You&#039;re right. Hmm... on second thoughts, I think the new patch should make playing the booster packs possible. The new weapons are compatible and everything. The difference is that you have to &quot;buy&quot; the booster packs to use the new weapons online. Otherwise, you&#039;ll just be victimised by them.<br /><br />Either that, or screw the booster packs and release a new expansion pack altogether. Or just make them new unlocks. Heck, why go through all the trouble? I&#039;m not spending more money on this game, besides the video card! &gt;:(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But that is, as Scar pointed out many many pages back, excatly what they want you to do. Spend spend spend. If you dont, you will be at a (huge?) disadvantage to those who will. I view it a bit as the way people buy, with real money, things in virtual games.<br /><br />I have read about people buying Warcraft characters, or was it items ? either way, buying instead of earning, which for me stinks. I would love to earn the new guns, unlock them. It creates goals. But getting guns by buying new packs ? I wouldnt mind so much if they were not able to use those guns to blast holes in my head from almost out of my guns range ! They should only be allowed to play with their own weapons (SF) on SF servers.<br /><br />Lets have a level field for vanilla BF2.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes but remember, the SF weapons you still have to earn, they aren&#039;t free. For example, if a new player with a rank say of a Corporal buys the SF exp. He still has to attain all the prior unlocks first in order to open the new stuff. Only reason it worked out good for me was the timing of when I bought the exp. I think I was just turning Sgt. at the time and had 1 unlock on hold, so when the time came for better ones to choose from I just had nicer options later. <br /><br />Now although I finally got newer weapons, I&#039;ve come to a few conclusions about them all. The Scar-l is an ok weapon, but it&#039;s accuracy isn&#039;t all that great. The F2000 is a good gun but the crosshairs for it were designed for nightvision, and can be kinda wacky at times trying to draw a good bead on someone. I thought Flashbangs were awesome at first but actually can be a big ole pain in my ass when I too am affected by the flash as well (wich pretty much blinds your ass along with your enemy). The other things are only used in SF maps only like nightvision,zip-lines, grappling-hook gas-masks etc. I&#039;m starting to think that the best weapons are the G36C and G36E and I think alot will agree that you will see more of those gun series killing you than any other. And the AT kit with shotgun, that kit is like the best of both worlds, kill tanks and inf. And of course my trusty Sniper rifle for when I want to go postal a few games playing lone-wolf.&nbsp; :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I guess you learn something new everyday. I have been trying to figure out how the hell people in game were killing me so fast by going prone,do a barrel roll and pop! 1 shot i&#039;m gone. I&#039;ve been trying to figure out that cool move since day 1, but come to find out it is only an animation and not an actual move. So when you go prone and move left or right the other guy sees you doing a barrel roll. Damn, I thought that was a secret trick move of some kind.&nbsp; :(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought every time you proned, you did a barrel roll.<br /><br />When selecting a server to play on, what does the number in brackets mean next to the number of players, so 4/64 (0) would be 4 players on out of a max of 64. Whats the 0, which I have sometimes seen as 2 ? Is that the number of members who belong to the server, as in the people on the members lists for that server ?</div>

When I am by a flag, I will change view (c - key) to see my whole tank, if I see anyone approach from behind, I either jump out and run, or reverse hard.<br /><br />Had the worst game I could imagine yesterday. Cant remember the name of the map, but its a regular one I play often. The american carrier is just off the coast, and the chinese have an airfield too. 6 capture points are located betwen you and them. All players start at the one base you have. Fine, we were american this tme, having whooped the guys as chinese last time.<br /><br />Our first players off the mark jump in to choppers, get them ready for the rest of us to jump in...right ? No.<br /><br />The dump sheets just took off in choppers that can hold 7 people alone, off to capture 6 flags that all the chinese forces are rushing to (remmeber they have land access, we dont). Well our jets got off, which is good. But now the chinese control all 6 flag points, as our two guys flew off in choppers that could hold 14.<br /><br />Man, everyone was on the carrier deck getting masacred. jets flying over, artillary as well. A few times, I got a loaded chopper and made a dash, but we always got shot down, they were just waiting for us.<br /><br />Conclusion: Can take just two dick heads to lose you the whole round.<br /><br />Oh, and Ackriku, just play a bit more, and it will give you your promo. I waited and waited for ages, nothing. Played for 10 mins and bingo.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After playing some Spec-ops earlier today, there was something I couldn&#039;t quite figure out that maybe someone else might know for sure. Lets say i&#039;m near an APC, put some C4 on it but before I get to detonate it, i&#039;m killed. Now, when I re-spawn again, is that C4 still attached to the APC ( assuming an engie hasen&#039;t fixed it yet)? And if so, can I still destroy that APC?</div>

I quickly worked out I need to lay more C4, which is sensible I suppose. <br /><br />Yes, cybo, it was the map woth you on it. We were stuffed so bad, it must&#039;ve been hilarious for the other guys. Not one of us buggers got off the carrier, other then the jets, and even they kept getting blown up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Very seldom do I spawn on the carrier at all, unless i&#039;m fairly sure of getting a hele. I kinda hate spending half a game just trying to get on the beach.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Only problem with that, scar...everyone has to spawn on the carrier in the start. Its a capture the empty flags race, whatever they are called. Basically, both sides rush to get the flags, usually 3 each, but if one side is slow, maybe 4 -2 ? Well we had 2 div pilots who made our team ultra slow, we got no flags ALL game.&nbsp; :(</div>

It worked out nice once for me on Wake Island. I put all my c4 on the nose, then made a bee line to thier main base, after I saw on radar there were a group huddled at the flag there I went high, then dove towards them, bailed out landed and detonated just at the right time. Damn I wish I coulda made a little movie outta that it was sweet. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I only managed to do it once so far on that map but dang it was cool when it worked. What made it work was the path I took the stretch of island leading to the enemy airfield, bailed and hit the chute right swhen I was practically at the ground then watched the jet finish heading to the spot then boom, just as it was going to explode. Still nice to know it can work.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just nit-picking a bit. The expansion is called Special Forces, not Special Ops ;)<br /><br />Yes, you CAN shoot while on a parashoot. Your aiming is limited though. You can&#039;t twist while on the parachute like 360 degrees to shoot something else. But what I&#039;m curious is, can you control your landing with the parachute, like where to aim, or how control of the parachute works?<br /><br />Oh, and since people in the backseat of a transport chopper can use their normal weapons, like engineers with their wrenches, a Spec Ops up there can blow the thing well. If only you could use your weapons while in a JET.<br /><br />I read somewhere that if you die as a Spec Ops with some C4s lying around, and someone happens to pick up your kit, he can still detonate your C4s. Never got to verify it, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You got me on the name, it might&#039;ve confused people haha. I can control my landin with the parachute fairly decent, you just hit left or right (pulling on the cords to your left or right) to glide to your destination. In the map where you can spawn in the air and parachute down, I usually aim for the rooftops and pick off who I can. <br /><br />Speaking of parachuting, I was in this jet as a passenger and the guy was going vertical for some reason and I realized he jumped out and I was just climbing altitude alone, so I bailed and parachuted and it took me literally a couple minutes before I touched gruond. I earned my airborne ribbon or whatever for a sustained parachute jump. It was great just floating forever lol.<br /><br />That&#039;s an interesting theory on the C4. I&#039;ll have to try it out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know what you mean, I love taking a jet full throttle straight up skyward till it almost stalls. Then bail hit the chute and as i&#039;m floating down hit the C key a few times to change the views. It&#039;s like a virtual skydive, I love it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The C4 certainly stays there. You are right about being able to shoot on parachute. I remember now.<br /><br />I had a git flying me around once, he jumped out after a bit, as we neared the edge of the map. That was before I realised I could change seats in a vehicle. I heard the guy talking about going awol, noticed I had no pilot, cursed a bit, bailed, and after a bit, died a&nbsp; painful death.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I take it the map where you spawn in the air is a SF map ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The graphics card has a processor too. Thats how it processes the data it gets from its own ram and from the game.<br /><br />Its a floating point processor. Or was when I last looked. God knows exactly what they are now. More commonly referred to as GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) as opposed to the CPU (Central Processing Unit).<br /><br />:)<br /><br />So two processors will be better then one processor and twice the RAM. At least thats what i believe the benifit will be.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok spicy, I am going to try to use less words and more statements to describe what I mean:<br /><br />Normal card:- xMB RAM, 1 x processor<br /><br />Your card:- 2xMB RAM, 1 Processor<br /><br />Now basically the difference is the double ram on &quot;Your Card&quot;. So if your card has 512, it is twice the RAM of Normal Card.<br /><br />Now, the advantage of having two Normal cards over one Your Card:-<br /><br />2 x Normal Card:- 2xMB RAM, 2 x processor<br /><br />Compared to Your card, you now have 2 processors not one.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="http://forum.dune2k.com/index.php?topic=18211.msg298600#msg298600">Quote from: sp1cy on January 26, 2006, 06:04:42</a></div><div class="quote">because i saw at nvidia web&nbsp; a 7800 gtx&nbsp; with 512mb&nbsp; so why put tow&nbsp; 256mb cards when u can put 1 ??<br /></div><br />This is where I am getting the difference between Your Card and Normal Card.

If the guy is running in your direction, aim for the legs in auto-fire mode,he&#039;ll&nbsp; go down. Theres a little thing I do with the mouse when say a guy is prone, if i&#039;m usuing full auto fire on him I don&#039;t let the recoil go anywhere, like raising up I mean. Its like this, While i&#039;m emptying a clip on him or however many it takes hehe, I keep kinda pushing my mouse down a little, as in moving it southward to counter the gun recoil if you get what i&#039;m saying. another good rule o thumb is get good and practice with all you machine guns set to semi not fully auto, your 10 times more apt to get a direct hit that way and kill (for me anyway) than fully auto.<br />&nbsp;Now for sniping, a 1 shot kill is just aim for the face thats it. The face is just plain easier to make out and is a lighter target that the top of the head. You&#039;ll get better just keep practicing.<br /><br /></div>

Many many times I have unloaded more fire into the enemies body, but he simply has a better gun which does more ddamage. He may also have slightly more armour (some kits give more armour).</div>

Sometimes you&#039;ll get him out of sheer probability, but I wouldn&#039;t count on that. What I do, and I can tell you how to practice this as well, is to tap the mouse, not hold it down to shoot. Tap it quickly and accurately in the higher portion of the guy. If you do this, you conserve your ammo, fire more accurate shots, and kill the guy quickly and before he can kill you. There&#039;s a caveat in this, though. Sometimes, when you&#039;re tapping it just takes too long. You can try tapping very quickly, but your accuracy might be affected. It&#039;s up to experience to teach you when to tap or when to unload. If you&#039;re close enough, unloading might be better because it&#039;s faster. <br /><br />Note: take a look at your crosshairs. The more they widen, the bigger the hit circle is and less chance you are hitting the guy. If you can, go prone or crouch before you shoot, and the circle will stay close. If you do it after you shoot, then it&#039;s of no use. So do it first!<br /><br />Being a sniper has its advantages, especially if you want to go silenced and camouflaged. But, it has little armor compared to assault or anti-tank. I would say the best kit to use is medic because you have decent armor, and you have the ability to heal yourself after every encounter. Otherwise, you&#039;re stuck relying on others to heal you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We&#039;ve all asked that question at one point or another. Hit the number corresponding to your gun after it is equipped to change the firing rate (default: 3) and hit it again to go back. It&#039;s useful in going semi when you&#039;re sniping people with a carbine ;-)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just be careful of close quarters where spraying might be a better option (so many times have I died going into a building with semi auto on without knowing, and having to tap furiously while the other guy just sprays without effort [or accuracy]). <br /><br />Is it just me, or have people been using GLs a little excessively lately? It&#039;s so annoying to see a guy come around a corner and wham! me with a GL every time I see him. I don&#039;t think he even used his rifle that round. If there was a GL medal I would understand&nbsp; ::)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree, I like the F2000 a lot better, but I&#039;m usually auto-switched to INSURGENTS, so I&#039;m used to the ak. I recently played a round with a medic, and damn I forgot how easy it was to rack points.

I came up with one way so far, if you could use the SF weapons like the zip-line and grappling hook on that map that would be awesome. Think of bieing able to scale all and any of those buildings on that map, and zip-line across in some areas that would rock.&nbsp; ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah cybo, your behind on fashion. Been there, done that, that is so last year. 8)<br /><br />I did that a while ago. Someone in red, on Karkand, hanging around our spawn point. A sniper he was. I was very quick, saved all my buddies from imminent death, the fools. Letting a sniper get in amongst, like, 6 of us !? WTF ? Well, I watched for a while, he didnt do nothing, so I thought...hmmm....and shot him dead.<br /><br />Well I am not a big thinker, see ? And guess what ? I got a team kill. What a beach. Well, we both spawn there again. So I hesitate this time. I am a quick learner, if not a big thinker ;). To me, his name is in red, like enemy, to him, I am enemy. To everyone else on our side, we are both friendly.<br /><br />This has happened maybe 4-5 times now. I figured it only happened to me, as no one else mentioned it. Now everytime it happens to me, I tell the other guy not to shoot. I explain whats going on, and we run from each other quickly. Maybe its server messing up somewhere, but no idea where. Maybe rejoining server would work (not always guaranteed to get back in) or maybe recreate sqaud...dunno.<br /><br />Will investigate when chances are presented.<br /><br />Good to know its not just me causing this.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes your correct there is a little bug that causes a teamate when first spawned for a sec to be seen as the enemy, however, the new patch due out anyday now will have that fixed as well.&nbsp; I too hae shot many teamates that way, but hey he was showing as red so, really not my fault.&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Erjin&#039;s problem sounds far worse than mine. I occasionally get my problem on Mashtuur City. Heck, it&#039;s the map whereby it happens most often, and even then it&#039;s only noticeable when the battle has ended and they indicate which side had won. So if you hear the occasionally &quot;We&#039;re losing this battle&quot; message it drags on a bit, but it doesn&#039;t get as bad as twice as long.<br /><br />Sound card problem?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, I got the same thing, a little strange but hey, I&#039;m certainly not complaining. If you need suggestions for what to spend those unlocks on, I&#039;d recommend the MP7 (half-life 2 gun) and the SAS support weapon, both of them make their respective classes actually useful in a firefight. The SAS support weapon combines accuracy with sustained firepower, you can shoot almost an entire hundred round clip before overheating and the MP7 is a powerful mid-range weapon for engineers, I like it because of its versatility, you don&#039;t need to switch to a pistol for ranged combat and it shoots fast enough for close range combat, although dont expect to be as trigger happy with it as you would be with other weapons as it chews through its four twenty round magazines in no time at all.<br /><br />BTW Acriku, have you downloaded Xfire (http://xfire.com) yet?</div>

Things are rolling along for the patch and the booster pack, and as expected you&#039;ll likely see them later this month. The patch will come first, and be well in place in time for the first Booster. That said, we want to inform you of a small oddity you may see in-game while we get the various aspects coordinated.<br /><br />Short explanation: At some point in the next couple of weeks, you will see an empty in-game window pop-up, just like you received an award. This is just GameSpy detecting now that when the patch comes out you will get another weapon unlock. You should only ever see it once or twice, depending on how high your rank and how many unlocks youll have coming. Once the patch is out, your weapon unlock will be available in the BFHQ tab and you can make your choice.<br /><br />Long Explanation: The next patch is going to give many players another weapon unlock at their current rank. In order to get the best testing results we are having GameSpy configure up the weapon unlocks now on their end. This allows us to test them in a true environment, which is rather effective. The side effect of this is that when this is first in place you are likely to see an empty placeholder message. It will look just like you received an award and will appear once for each unlock youve earned. This message would be telling you that you have received another weapon unlock, but we haven&#039;t patched the weapons in yet. So you will see this placeholder message which is harmless. When the patch is in place though, the stats system will think you already got your notification in- game. So you will want to hit the BFHQ tab and unlock your free weapon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I personally have never had a problem with Xfire (http://www.xfire.com) lagging me, even when I was playing Bf2 with voice chat on &quot;very high&quot; quality.<br />Right now without voice chat, windows task manager says that Xfire is using 7,700 kb of memory, for reference, internet explorer is using 17,732 kb with only this page open. The only reason why I think it could have caused scar to lag would be that he had automatic download on, which might have caused some slowdown but by default file transfers turn off while the computer is in use.<br /><br />Edit: Just think, if you had xfire we could be having this conversation right now with or without voice and you wouldn&#039;t have to wait for me to post. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But he would have to put up with your squeaky voice :P<br /><br />But I spuppose that is a limitation of Teamspeak too.<br /><br />Sorry for the mix up then, I didnt realise it could handle multiple users in conversation at once.<br /><br />As for lagging, I dont think it causes me to lag. I usually have either xfire or xfire and teamspeak on with BF2.</div>

It looked like twisting it around caused too much tension on the wires and they snapped. <br />Oh well, it was a cheap five dollar headset, and as the saying goes; &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;.</div>

I don&#039;t even want to do the math for the higher ones yet. Damn, has anyone ever really looked at some of the top current player stats and the hours some have played?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">BF2 news:<br />---------<br />As mostly everyone has already figured out by now, EA/Gamespy global stat servers are having issues. For some reason they are not recording the stat updates very quickly. Some people claim to receive their points/awards after about 24 hours, but others still have them missing. <br />There has been no word yet from EA concerning this.<br /><br /><br />The EA Germany site has released some more information regarding the upcoming BF2: Euro Force booster pack. Although it&#039;s written in German, here at BFNation we&#039;ve managed to extract the following details:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The boost pack will be released on February 23rd - whether this only applies to Germany is not clear<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * When you buy Euro Force, you don&#039;t buy a physical product, merely a code. With this code you are then able to download the game with the EA Downloader<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It looks like you&#039;ll need a GameSpy username to use the downloader<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The download will be approximately 350MB in size</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well you guys it out now.<br /><br />The new patch as speaking, here is what it does:<br /><br />BUG FIXES &amp; GAMEPLAY TWEAKS <br />- Dolphin Diving is no longer possible <br />- Players can no longer jump and shoot at the same time <br />- &quot;Prone Spamming&quot; is now fixed <br />- &quot;Sprint exploit&quot; is now fixed <br />- Helicopters now carry 8 missiles rather than 14 <br />- TV-Guided missile now have a shorter range <br />- Damage decreased from M134 <br />- Hit points on all air vehicles has been reduced <br />- AA missile lock has been improved <br />- All support kit weapons have been adjusted <br />- All Sniper rifles have been adjusted <br />- Sa80 has been adjusted <br />- G3A3 has been adjusted <br />- Reload while sprinting has been enabled <br />- Medic defibrillator paddles have been adjusted. They now reload while not in use. <br />- SCAR-L reload sound has been fixed <br />- Server setting to allow friendly fire to be off on mines without affecting other weapons. <br />- Server search filters now work properly <br />- Mines can no longer be destroyed with other explosives <br />- Bug in MP7 fire rate fixed. Ammo count increased and mag count and damage decreased <br />- Flash bang effect radius decreased <br />- Added unlocks for Sniper and AT kits <br />- Fixed a bug in terrain rendering with night vision, whereby terrain was still dark in dark areas. <br />- Fixed a bug whereby mods that are not bf2 or not xpack permutate shaders every time a level is loaded. <br />- Fixed a bug whereby non-xpack mods cannot use xpack shaders. <br />- Fixed bug in TV guided missiles of Havoc helicopter <br />- The LAV25 no longer shoots through penetrable materials. <br />- Vehicles no longer disappear when viewed from some vehicles with a HUD (e.g. Tanks). <br />- Performance gain found in static mesh rendering. <br />- Detonation radius from grenade launcher explosions has been reduced. <br />- Grenade launcher projectiles now have a minimum distance. <br />- Decreased Flashbang count from 4 to 3 <br />- Replaced the existing Czech Flag with the correct one in the front end <br /><br />EXPANSION OF RANKS <br />- Ranks have now been expanded to allow for players to rank up to General <br /><br />NEW FEATURE <br />VISIBLE UAV <br />- The UAV that is placed by Commanders will now include a visual element. An actual UAV will appear within the UAV detection radius and circle the area. Players will be able to shoot it down, bringing the UAV detection to a premature end. The Commander will be able to continue placing UAVs once the timer resets, as per current design. <br /><br />KNOWN ISSUE <br />ATI CROSSFIRE CARDS <br />- Crossfire cards with 256 Megs of memory, running in CrossFire mode will run out of memory at very high resolution settings. On very high resolutions, such as 1920x1440 with 6x antialiasing. In CrossFire mode the ATI drivers are more restrictive about where resources are allocated, and as a result run out of memory sooner than with a single board. This running out of memory causes the device context creation to fail. The result is that the game just sits in a loop with a black screen. If you experience a context creation failure change your resolution to a lower setting (e.g. 1024x768 or even lower).<br /><br />Here is where to get it (one of the places)<br /><br />http://www.xfire.com/xf/modules.php?name=XFire&amp;file=files&amp;op=file&amp;q=1373<br /><br /><br />Cybopache<br /><br />had 4 kills with knife on Karkand yesterday, dived to stuck another one and as the blade is to penetrate the uniform BANG....Kicked from the server due to high ping...lol I was not the one with highest ping.I think there was a admin angry for beeing stabbed 3times lol (and I had&nbsp; a pretty nice score too )</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven&#039;t played much this past week, but I just dloaded the full patch last night,played a few games. I say it makes a huge difference in gameplay, it&#039;s nice to finally play it without a crapload of Bunny-hoppers jumping all around. And by that I mean I actually did not see one person do it. Also played a bit of sniper last night and noticed a big difference in the accuracy. Hard to explain but now I think you know when a M-95 hits your ass. (Which is the way it always should have been).&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />This patch also has a nice progress bar showing what is being patched and not just a little window saying patching please wait. Great patch I think, nice improvement to a more realistic environment and gameplay.</div>

For one the AA turrets kick ass on all aircraft, I downed many aircraft last night on Wake Island just sitting in one for a while trying it out. Could also actually see clearly with sniper rifle from across the two islands and pick off both infantry and a few heles that hovered. Karkand is no longer a bunny-fest when there are a pile of inf. fighting.&nbsp; ;) it&#039;s amazing how many people relied on that crap to get a kill. So it really has made my game a bit better.

They are goo when making big movements, in fact they are very good. But try to use finese and boom, game over.<br /><br />Roller ball is much better for that.<br /><br />Good news, sounds fixed following my reinstall.

These are being addressed immediately and we are working around the clock to resolve those. Patch 1.21 (coming soon) will be tested in a limited beta with select Battlefield community members starting as early as this week. Were doing this to ensure a clean release of 1.21. In addition, we have decided to postpone the Euro Force Booster Pack until sometime after the release of the updated 1.21 patch.<br /><br />Stick to this web space for additional information soon.<br /><br />On a more pleasant note, Battlefield 2 hit somewhat of a milestone last night with over 52,000 simultaneous players. This is the highest number of players weve seen at one time for Battlefield 2 and almost 4 times more than the peak number of Battlefield 1942. <br /><br />Thanks in advance for your patience.<br /><br />The team at DICE and EA<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, that next patch fix is mainly for fixing a bug that causes a certain map crash with that new patch. Really nothing major.<br /><br />Heres something else though I find funny as hell. I&#039;ve noticed alot of servers are introducing new rules such as No PKM&#039;s. Now I just unlocked that gun, I thought it was hilarious because playing the support kit is suppose to be somewhat of a powerhouse kit in a squad. As far as the new patch goes, I think it&#039;s pretty simple...If you relied on the stupid, unrealistic crap, then you will hate it, if not then you will love the improvements...I know I do.&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No patch v1.21 is not out yet<br /><br /><br />EA have released a community update stating that they&#039;re aware of the problems with the latest v1.2 update and that they&#039;re working hard to get the v1.21 hotfix out.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The patch will be tested in a limited beta starting the end of this week. We&#039;re working around the clock to minimize your wait on the release of 1.21 but at the same time want to make sure that the patch is thoroughly tested before it goes out officially.<br /><br />The v1.21 hotfix will include, among other things, the following bug fixes:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Crash bug when using Hummer with TOW in the Special Forces expansion pack has been fixed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Screen capture is now working<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Performance issues with certain ATI cards has been addressed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Server browser can now filter by map name<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Claymores - the number that can be dropped at any one time has been reduced to 2<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Stats problem was already resolved when i played this morning&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />The GameSpy stats server, responsible for storing Battlefield 2 account details and scores, is currently unavailable. As a result, players may be having trouble logging in, or viewing their points, ranks, etc. This is most likely only a temporary glitch and nothing to worry about.</div>

So I was looking down concentrating on the job, and some joe runs up and starts shooting at me, so with my super reflexes, I Filled him full of pellets with one shot hes dead. Just as I saw his name in blue...and I thought &quot;sheet, what have I done ?&quot;. I then thought wtf, he deserved it.<br /><br />Of course, he punished...bah, these things happen. Except he respawns and by now I got an apc, and he manages to somehow get form behind me to being run over by me (when I am starting off forwards). Punish again. Then he respawns, gets a car, rams me, and punishs again !<br /><br />Man I ripped in to him verbally, but that may have only made him happy.<br /><br />I just moved off the server.

Well I shot after the flames from his canon and after 3 tries I rammed him and hes mate(2 KILLS).Moved over to the gr def at the USA side of the bridge.There comes a hummy and tried to catch the flag and bang hes dead<br />(3 kills)I sat on the cannon and a soldier comes running down the ramp and took the car right beside the defence,bang he was dead(4 Kills).Heres the funny part, he comes running once more without checking the gr defence spot, jumped in the car once more and BANG for the 2nd time<br />(5 kills) and cybo gets a Ground Defence Ribbon. LOL<br /><br />cybo commander<br /><br />P.S&nbsp; this is me stretching out after&nbsp; a artillery attack.Just chillin out<br /><br />[attachment deleted by Gobalopper]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A little tip for you guys: when a guy punishes you, you do not get a worse point penalty. It only adds up how many times you&#039;ve been punished and through punkbuster you&#039;ll get kicked after so many times. What a relief when I found this out.<br /><br />The penalty system is set that if you kill a guy really quickly (like a frag, GL, or head shot) you&#039;ll just get -4. But if you shoot him over and over until he dies, then you&#039;ll get -6 because of the -2 from team damage (whether or not you kill him).</div>

Can&#039;t think of the spyware removal that worked on most of them, but eventually I just gave up and formatted or image whatever you do. I had like 30 all together from trojans to spyware to browser hijack..not only did I format it made me so damn mad I low-level formatted the HDD with powermax. But Erjin has the info on alot of the ways to find them and get rid of alot of em. I don&#039;t remember the exact web site.</div>

Make sure a password is set on this Windows account. If you do have access an admin account, you can right click on the application you want to run and select &quot;Run As&quot;. This will allow you to give admin access to that program and should allow you to play with a limited user. <br /><br />When that did not work, please try this file: <br /><br />http://www.greyknight17.com/spy/VX2Finder(126).exe <br /><br /><br />Click the &quot;Find VX2.betterinternet info&quot; button to make sure that you don&#039;t HAVE this adware. If there are no files listed, go on to the last step. <br /><br />If you find the virus, (it is usually 3 random named dll files) <br /><br />Select all the files found. <br />Press &#039;Delete These Files&#039;. <br /><br />The program will delete all files but one that will be deleted on reboot. <br />Allow program to reboot. <br /><br />Once Restarted: <br />Press &#039;Guardian.reg&#039;. <br />Press &#039;User Agent&#039;. <br />Click on the &quot;Restore Policy&quot; Button! <br /><br />Clicking on &quot;find vx2.BetterInternet info&quot; again should show all fields blank (especially &quot;User Agent String&quot;). When you still get the Inadequate O/S priviledges kick, make a new note in your ticket and include the scan results from VX2Finder(126).exe in your note.<br /><br /><br />Cheers cybo commander<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.3em;">My first Time</span><br /><br />The first time ever I thought I wouldnt chicken out and use a gun, but would use my knife on a guy. It was a sniper on Sharqi Paninsular, below the top of the 3 MEC bases. Not too far from the first american base actually, on some hills around the back (the best place for your first time ;)). He was a sniper, I was a beginner, hardly any idea how to do what I knew was required.<br /><br />Well, I whipped it out, and walked up behind him, and he had been lying down shooting off. As I approached, he got up and walked off. So I chased, trying to slash from behind and getting nowhere. 8-odd slashes in thin air later, and almost having run in front of him in a bid to catch up, I finally struck from behind, scap style. Well, the git survived, and got down again, thinking he had been seen.<br /><br />Finally ! A sitting target, wham, back of the head, and one dead sniper ! And one happy Erjin !<br /><br />Though I prefer guns :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">you have to do a dive attack.. you can decreasse this speed of your dive tho by making sure you are stationary before diving.&nbsp; You dont want to dive if you are already going full speed (300mph) in a chopper.&nbsp; SLow the chopper down... acquire target and slowly dive and fire.<br /><br />Also the missiles are great for shooting enemy helicopters in teh air.&nbsp; So they are air to ground and air to air missiles as well.<br /><br /><br />In addition... the missiles fire slightly below the targeting reticle...so put the oject below the reticle for accuracy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been commander for a decent amount of time, and I&#039;d have to say that it is fun. I usually end up being engineer/commander because nobody takes their time to repair your stuff, so I end up doing it anyway and also my commander stuff. It&#039;s stressful though when you mark a place for artillery and your guys are attracted to that very spot all at once like a magnet. I try to yell over the team chat, but nobody listens (I&#039;ve been warning them in advance, which seems to work most of the time). Often times I&#039;ll find myself going at odds with the other commander over side bases (like in ghost town) where extra artillery is found. You get double points if you win the match, too&nbsp; ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i loved the the knifing the sniper story, so funny ,i love finding snipers who dont know you r there you can almost whip out a picnic and enjoy it while thinking how best to kill him, i had a funny knife kill once. it was a total fluke i was planting c4 a guy came up for the kill on me , i freaked i got such a fight he was there, i threw c4 at him by mistake and then instead of my rifle i switched to my knife stabbing away like i was double tapping my rifle. somehow i was still there he was dead and i needed a medic pack quick, its moments like that that make the game so good.... so what server you guys play on ? im in New Zealand , but im sure i can get a low enough ping to play on more distance servers , if anyone want to check out any nz servers try the Xtra Ranked servers but i hope to catch up with you guys online sometime</div>

I know it would really mess up the rating BF2 has already, but damn that would add to the realism alot I think.

I am now a coperal with and have a new unlock but havn&#039;t decided which gun to get yet so I&#039;m real exited ;D<br />I already have the PKM which really is a fabulous gun, kind of feels like a lighter version of the apc gun turret as it fires the same slow rate as the apc IMO. Its a slow heavy gun which packs a punch from short and medium range and I killed 7 ppl with it in the prone position and thas to show how good it is unlike these guns which only have 30 bullets or less, considering 100 bullets in one gun and that helps to know I can happily mow down anyone without worrying for ammo.<br /><br />So I just wanna say a big thankyou to ergin for letting me use his comp for a great game of bf 2. <br /><br />p.s. scar. that time I played in the server we were in. I had to log out coz I had to do something, and I couldn&#039;t come back to that server cos I lost the ip for it. In case u where wondering heh. 8)</div>

I was playing Commander that game anyway. On the unlock, I&#039;m not gonna tell you what or which to go with, but I will say that the Spec-Ops unlock is very nice..the g36c. In my opinion anyway it&#039;s just a damn nice all around weapon, in semi or auto&nbsp; mode with a nice fast rate of fire.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken out snipers with it at long ranges also. All the G36-series guns kick ass I think anyway. Very low recoil,accurate,light (except the G3 assault). I have them all except the next G36-Support unlock.<br /><br />Btw. Yesterday I picked up a dead guys kit to see what it was and it happened to be the new AT-kit French made weapon.&nbsp; What a piece of crap!! took like 15 hits to a guy to actually kill him. I&#039;m not trying to bash France here in anyway, but in a game about modern warfare...I just have issues I guess about unlocking a &quot;French-made weapon.&quot; :P&nbsp; Now that i&#039;ve actually tried it out some..I am totally correct....it kinda blows (the weapon that is).<br /></div>

Since playing online is too difficult for me (both hardware and skill issues), I&#039;m going to try playing singleplayer and win rounds without dying at all. Let&#039;s see how much I&#039;d improve at it.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty fun, too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Only jets can get the left shift boost (or just double-tap &#039;W&#039;, or whatever your forward key is). It&#039;s the same as running. Other vehicles do not get this function.<br /><br />I don&#039;t fly jets often. Hell, I get pwned by Easy computer on Operation Clean Sweep, can&#039;t fly those awesome things for nuts... maybe I&#039;ll switch to using the keyboard. Not everybody uses a joystick, or owns one anyway. For the mouse, you can adjust the sensitivity, Yaw and Pitch factors for aircraft under Controls. Increase them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well I use a joystick for jets, and the rolling thingy is pretty easy, you just push your joystick either to the right or to the left. I&nbsp;also have the option to twist the handle&nbsp; to get the rudder right or left.I mean if you really want to get good at flying &quot; JOYSTICK&quot; is the only thing.<br /><br />It`s right that only jets have the afterburner. Left shift in a tank tower makes you duck in the tower etc. Well anyone can retrieve their account from another Machine,without giving the cd-key away.<br /><br /><br />cybo commander</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been using the G3 lately alot more, that&#039;s a very underrated gun I think.(damn that thing has some major stopping power) I also think alot depends on the player as to which type of gun aiming he likes better. Some like scopes and laser sites and others like the regular iron sites. For me I like all of them, so I just am always switching around depending on whats going on at the moment.<br /><br />I would also like to add that, well I know I told everyone to get SF and it was so great, now don&#039;t get me wrong I do like SF just not the nightime maps. What I will say is DO GET the Euro-Forces booster pack. I have to say I am totally hooked on those maps and weapons, I would choose that over SF anyday put it that way. Can&#039;t go wrong there for around 10 dollars. I love it so far.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="http://forum.dune2k.com/index.php?topic=18211.msg302408#msg302408">Quote from: Re-erjin999 on March 29, 2006, 06:13:32</a></div><div class="quote">It can be done with a mouse, dont worry about those non-skilled joystick users :P (watch the words heat up now ;))...<br /><br />Seriously, I dont game enough to bother with a joystick, but reading those links made me wish I did !<br /></div><br />The trick to the using the mouse is all in the settings, yaw,pitch etc. I have all mine maxed out.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Totally agree.<br /><br />If I get SF and/or Eurobooster, will i need to start again to get the unlocks 2 at a time ? I assume thats whats been happening with you ladies. You get a promo and get an unlock from the game and one from the expansion pack ?<br /><br />If thats true I would start again to get a better weapon and die less and rank up quicker (still like the F2000 whenever I steal it off dead bodies :P). I want my kill/death ratio to be at least 1:1.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man, so many servers I used to play on have upgraded and are still playing normal maps I have, but as they must have the eurobooster pack I cant play on them. Might be forced to upgrade. Humbug.<br /><br />On a more positive note, I was getting 30+ kills and &lt;15 deaths. That gives a K/D ratio of 2:1 or better, and I sustained that over more then one match/round/level or whatever. Basically I was shit hot yesterday ! I was using PKM (normal support unlock) with its nice big round so I can kill many people without reloading, and was NOT zooming in, but only proning.<br /><br />Normally I would prone and zoom, losing sight of people coming from other angles. This time, I didnt zoom, and was swinging about killing person after person, man it felt good to unleash some poo on those people, where normally I get poo&#039;d on.</div>

Its apparently makes my current favourite gun, the PKM, less effective, although I read it brings them inline with other support guns. Quite if this is what it means I am not 100% sure.<br /><br />Now I think less servers are showing up in red, so alls good. Thanks for the help though Cybodude.</div>

Consider that players get spawn raped, artilliary&#039;d and taken out in other ways too, I am sure, that are uncontrollable and almost unfair (although they are fair ! Spawn raping :P), and then still manage to get a balanced (~1:1) K/D ratio.<br /><br />this means in normal battle he kills not only as much as he dies, but also extra to make up for the artillary and C4s and spawn rapes...etc....<br /><br />Thats my aim ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />&nbsp;well its all about the range issue.. if you plan to run for long distance and fight close range attacks the pkm will slow you down as it is about 16 kilos to carry and its usless to shot from it unless ure prone... the mg36 gives you the advantage of using it from standing or running status giving you a massive fire power over the ather attacking untis sutch as assolts and SO&nbsp; units who carry a normal 20 shot magazine rifels..but they will still be faster than you and have more accurecy unless you have better or higher spotes on them whitch is what a good support soldier must do..then you can prone offcorse and have better aim..<br />&nbsp;but if you didnt and you had to move long distances or fight hand to hand combat then the pkm is totaly unusfull and you might find the mg more handy and eazy to use like a normal m16 or clachinckof....<br />the pkm is good if you plan to block a streat or make an anbush to defend a flag it is 10 times more powerfull than the MG-36&nbsp; but i hurd they reduced it accurecy in one of the patches.. i remeber killing 10 guyes in a row with a pkm&nbsp; when they tryed to march to a flag just one after the other it a stationary killing machine.</div>

For me I like all of them, so I just am always switching around depending on whats going on at the moment.<br /><br />I would also like to add that, well I know I told everyone to get SF and it was so great, now don&#039;t get me wrong I do like SF just not the nightime maps. What I will say is DO GET the Euro-Forces booster pack. I have to say I am totally hooked on those maps and weapons, I would choose that over SF anyday put it that way. Can&#039;t go wrong there for around 10 dollars. I love it so far.<br /><br /></div><br />would u give us some details ef addon? like do we get more unlocks?? and if yes do u think the weapoms are better than those of sf??? i didnt see any extra unlocks for for bf2 on the game guide<br />&nbsp;exept for those of sf and main bf2.. thank u</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven&#039;t played much lately but I do like the Euro-Force pack and maps alot more than SF. I got my veteran commander badge a while back on the Operation Smoke Screen map. The AT kit is nice too with the new gun instead of a shotgun, kinda like having a Scar-l and AT missiles. The medic rifle I picked up the other day and tried, that&#039;s a strange looking gun. Well worth the 10 dollars I think. Actually, I would&#039;ve rather bought the Euro-Force over the SF. for the map choices alone anyway.&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s quite sad that you buy something solely for the unlocks or the new weapons. What&#039;s really worth the price tag is the new elements of gameplay that have been added to the game. Special Forces and Euro Force provide that (I don&#039;t have EF, but judging SF, the style of the new maps really changes the mode of gameplay altogether. More infantry battles means more fun). The new guns are really just a bonus.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">SF&#039;s is really eye-candy I jumped on and got right away. It&#039;s pretty much a different game of it&#039;s own. With the EF packs though, they are just like getting any other patch. Just a few more newer maps,and weapons is all. The good thing about the EF pack is if I join a game I don&#039;t have to restart the entire game in EF game mode...it just starts. Also I didn&#039;t get any unlocks yet after I bought it, but I really didn&#039;t expect too yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Usually for adjusting for extreme long distance shots, rise and fall of hit etc. In SOF it was used for zoom factor on the left side,but in BF2 I doubt you will ever need to really use the others at all.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Basecamp is basically (to my knowledge) camping in or just outside a base and killing people as they are seen within the base. Baseraping is basically going through a base and killing people as soon as they spawn. When one side is down to their home base, it is generally regarded as fair play when the enemy does not camp that base and instead lets the losing side come to their flags and engage them their (it&#039;s more fun for both sides).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are you up to the latest patch ? I think I got that when I was a version behind.<br /><br />As for servers, I get them trickle in up to around 300-400, although it has gone as far as 2500, I am not going to wait for that to happen everytime.<br /><br />Now I have bookmarked the regular servers as favourites.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just patched myself again with the incremental 1.2 to 1.21. Is there anything higher? Maybe I should do a full patch instead of an incremental?<br /><br />Anyway, I got euro force, it&#039;s fun but the maps are basically tank maps/ sniper maps. I can&#039;t play with anything other than anti-tank (but I still manage to kick ass and have fun).</div>

Ackri, you said that the explsion from a grenade was too small, well I think the animation is crap, a small puff of smoke, the actual range is pretty good, and kills a nice wide circle of people.</div>

He said &quot;Get Out&quot;...I couldnt find the option that said &quot;Like Hell&quot; so I replied &quot;No Way&quot;.<br /><br />He kept doing it, and I kept saying no, then I said yes, and he said ok...this went on for ages, and by now he had taken off, so i figures we gonna play now.<br /><br />No luck, he went over to the edge of the combat zone, and you know what happens if you go beyond the combat zone ! You start to get punished for mootany :P<br /><br />Well, co pilot sits infront of pilot, and guess what ? He puts me over the edge and stays out himself ! I died. Whata complete w*nk !<br /><br />Now I wanna stalk this guy and get him teamkilled, atry the guy, whatever !<br /><br />By the way, his nick was battleking999 (no relation to Erjin999 ;)).</div>

I was co-piloting and the guy went vertical for a bit and I thought hey this is cool... and then we kept going. And going. And then I realized there wasn&#039;t a &quot;we&quot; after all - he bailed long ago! So here I was going vertical in the co-pilot seat, and I think to myself: I wonder how long I can parachute down if I keep going up this high. So, after a moment or two of climbing I bail out and parachute all the way, had to have been around a minute or two. I admired all the visuals as I went down, and lo and behold I got a ribbon I never knew existed! The air time ribbon! I laughed my ass off for a while after that one. <br /><br />I wish I SSed the guy talking to me as I went down, but when he spoke halfway through my airtime he said &quot;Still falling?&quot; Of course I said &quot;yuuuup&quot;. Good times.</div>

Over to the right up on the hill near the shrubs when 2 guys popped out from the buildings coming towards me and with one shot...one head-shot, they both died. :)&nbsp; 2 head-shot kills with only 1 shot...knda like a domino effect due to them being directly lined up I guess. I wish I had that on a movie clip now. It was no fluke either, me on top of the hill, one guy in front(the guy it was intended for) and the other guy right behind him going prone...JFK&#039;ed both with a single shot.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think if you get Battlefield 2 v1.22 (372MB) you should be set.<br />Also the Euro-Forces booster pack is nice I think anyway it has some nice roomy maps all daytime geared towards tanks,sniping and vehicles,heles and jets. It&#039;s not like special forces were the game has to start over when you choose a server. Also, those maps are great for commanding thats how I got my veteran commander badge. I would say that for the 10 bucks you get way more gameplays on the euro force maps than the special forces by far. In fact, I would have never gotten special forces for the fact that I just never play it now.</div>

I like TS the most as it doesn&#039;t interfear with anything. If someone calls you on Skype, you still get a damn popup during play (which minimizes the game).<br /><br />Soon Game Heaven (http://www.game-heaven.com/main/) should have it&#039;s own BF2 server running, together with TS.

So I could use TS just for communication&#039;s sake and we could form our Fed2k sometime!<br /><br />That is, when all of us are free.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The good thing about Xfire is if I see one or two people playing I can just click and join their game and or thier squad to join them fast. <br />It&#039;s kinda like a nice buddy search wich BF2 needs anyway. I&#039;ve never had it minimise the game on BF2 yet.</div>

The release of this patch is in line with our ongoing effort to make the game as enjoyable as possible, releasing quicker fixes addressing some of the things that you want to see changed.<br /><br />New Features:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Co-op: Players can now enjoy single player levels on Internet and LAN play with both Bots and human players. We have added a few options to allow the server admin to modify how the bots behave in game. Co-op play is not permitted on ranked servers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Air Dropped Vehicles: Squad members can no send a request to commanders to drop vehicles at their location.<br /><br />Bug Fixes &amp; Gameplay Tweaks:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ban list will no longer be wiped in the event of a server crash.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Abandoned helicopters will no longer remain in flight.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * If a player joins a squad while dead they will not be permitted to use the squad leader as a spawn point until they have spawned at a flag once.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Flag Capture bar will now react accurately to players entering the capture radius.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Friendly vehicles will no longer appear as valid targets for missile systems. The box with the X through it will still appear however the locked tone will not sound and missiles fired will not track the friendly target.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when switching between game types.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed a tech hang when creating a single player account from an offline account.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed Issues with remote console and Linux servers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed the issue that prevented players from ranking up in-game when playing on their regular server.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed the bug that altered mini map behavior.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed issue with Special Forces rank names.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Fixed repairing HUD for the engineer when in a vehicle. <br /><br />bf2patch1.3.exe - 438MB<br />bf2incrementalpatch1.22-1.3.exe - 83MB<br />bf2_server_1.3.exe - 297MB<br />server files for Linux v1.3 - 297MB<br /><br />The team at Dice and EA<br /><br />Here&#039;s the patch download links....<br /><br />http://largedownloads.ea.com/pub/patches/BF2/BF2_Full_13.exe<br />http://largedownloads.ea.com/pub/patches/BF2/BF2_Incremental_122_13.exe</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Community Update - 5/09/06<br /><br />Greetings Soldiers:<br /><br />We at DICE and EA are aware of the concern surrounding the coming change to squad selection. We would like to take a moment to ease the feelings of tension related to this change.<br /><br />Our goal is to refocus game play on team work, squad coordination and to also remove the spawning exploit used by some. In BF2 we introduced tools that would allow players to support one another as they battle for control points. To further enhance this aspect of game play squads were introduced to give players even more tools to coordinate their efforts and support each other.<br /><br />Allowing squad mates to spawn on the squad leader was intended to provide an easy way for squads to stay together during chaotic battles. Unfortunately squad leaders have been used by some to launch team wide attacks on remote parts of maps with little thought to actual team unity beyond these maneuvers.<br /><br />We believe this change will refocus the game play on team work and add more value to the roles of Squad Lead and Commander.<br /><br />/The team at Dice and EA<br />&nbsp;</div>

Althoguh I doubt you will be able to change the texture detail unless if you buy more RAM.<br /><br />If you do get it don&#039;t forget to download Xfire as well, most of us use it as our primary chat/match organiser/gamefinding tool. I&#039;m sure there was a list of Xfire nicks posted in the thread somewhere but if you can&#039;t find it my Nickname is Rewired9 and I&#039;m sure everyone else will tell you theirs in no time at all.</div>

The thing I am talking about keeps sqauds together, it allows the leader of a sqaud to do what his sqaud already does...so I see them as two seperate things.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe you mean, &quot;is this still possible&quot; well Erjin, you can still spawn on your squadleader, however you have to spawn once at a flag after joining a squad before you may spawn at your squadleader so squadleaders can&#039;t spawn on squadmembers.<br />Or as you would say, <br />&quot;Good Erjin, you could still produce in yours squadleader, however you will have to produce time in join the squad in a flag later perhaps produced in you in front of yours squadleader therefore squadleaders to be unable to produce in squadmembers.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Again, I still can&#039;t get over the fact you can now drop vehicles when commanding. Thats a really nice addition,especially on the large maps where if you have to foot it, it&#039;s a considerate person to get where your going. Speaking of dropping vehicles, in my last game I made a drop and it landed on 3 enemies and smashed em, hehe.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is very nice !<br /><br />I once rode on the outside of a plane on a map...wake island. From the aircraft carrier to the island (almost).<br /><br />The pilot, on the carrier, put his wing on the deck and (his frineds I guess) some guys got on. So I joined them, and he took off. They all fell off but I held on for life. He was using the jets that can hover, and was hovering and moving forward, not flying. He went very high and slowwwwwly forwards too. Wish I took some pics of that.<br /><br />Once in a lifetime thing ! The whole screen juddered as BF2 thought I shold fall then decided I shouldnt...</div>

See any discrepancies there? Oh, right, the skill level, they obviously compensate for that; so how about this, you are a master sergeant, Scar is a master sergeant, you have played on ABR for 140 hours, Scar has played on EA&#039;s &quot;inferior&quot; system for 543 hours. Therefore, in light of these strange statistics which don&#039;t seem to add up, wouldn&#039;t you have to agree that in ABR it is much easier to gain ranks?<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy, what you have is nothing short of a cheesy demo. I tried a copied version before I bought the game,a try before I buy sort of thing. Until you have the full purchased and patched game then you will not understand what I mean by that. I&#039;m sure anyone else who plays it will also agree. You can play on-line yes...but it&#039;s pure crap,unpatched,bugged to death and unrealistic rankings like you have.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Whatever, lets leave that conversation. Hey, lets talk about stats again !<br /><br />I am going up in what I consider the most important count of sucess at this game. Yes, the old Kill/death ratio.<br /><br />I was mid 20s when I first looked. Got it up to 50% when I started playing ok. Left the game for a while, and came back, still around the 50% mark.<br /><br />Note, the longer you play, the more effort it takes to make a significant change.<br /><br />I now have it up to around 78%.<br /><br />My aim is to get to 100% and beyond !<br /><br />My accuracy has suffered in my attempt to get to 100% K/D ratio, probably cos I am shooting like crazy trying to hit where I am not sure there even is anyone. <br /><br />I am also about 400points away from a promo, and am not sure what to go for. Remember I have normal BF2 (no expansions) so my choice is limited. God I would love to get the F2000, I think I love that gun ! Hardly used it, but when I have, I have liked what I saw.<br /><br />Also, with scars advice, I have used sniper claymores to get some cheap kills (I consider them cheap :)).<br /><br />How are you guys doing with K/D ratio and accuracy ? What else do you guys consider important in stats ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why has no one mentioned the <b><i>Glitch</i></b> ! Beware the Glitch, where players use the vehicle drop (which is only somewhat useful anyway) to enter buildings (drive off the top of a biulding in an alleyway and the front of the vehicle will take you INTO a closed building). You can then shoot out and no one can shoot in. Most used in the hotel on Karkand from what I&nbsp; have seen.<br /><br />Its pure evil and EA better rush out a patch for it. Admins do kick for it but how can they always spot it ?<br /><br />Again, its pure evil.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I came across this site which has many BF2 tweaks for sytem enhancements. Give it a try on some of them and see what improvments or not may come about.<br /><br />Info: How can I get better performance out of BF2?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Submited: 06-22-06 | Last Update: 1 Week Ago #1&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I relize there is another guide out there for BF2, but it only covers graphics settings, so I&#039;ll give you some actual &quot;tweaks&quot;.<br /><br />Make sure your ports are open<br />BF2 is set up to use upnp (universal plug and play), but some firewalls/routers won&#039;t open all of the ports the program needs to function. The full list of ports follows:<br /><br />PHP Code:<br />TCP 16567 <br />TCP 16569 <br />UDP 27900 <br />UDP/TCP 29900 <br />TCP 80 <br />TCP 4711 <br />TCP 29901 <br />UDP 1500-4999 <br />UDP/TCP 1024-1124 <br />UDP 28910 <br />UDP 16567 <br />UDP 55123-55125&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Change PB Scan Time<br /><br />One reason why you might be getting spurts of decreased performance while online is PunkBuster scanning your harddrive for cheats/hacks/ect. By default, PB scans every 20 seconds, which can slow you down quite a bit. <br /><br />To fix this, we&#039;ll change the interval between scans from 20 seconds to 50 seconds. This is not detected as hack by PB, and is fully legal on any ranked server. In fact, EvenBalence sanctions it. <br /><br />Step 1: Open BF2, and join any ranked server that is running PB. (Thats most of them.) <br />Step 2: Walk around for a bit, then hit the ~ key. (Below &quot;Esc&quot;) This opens up the console. <br />Step 3: Make sure the cursor in the console is blinking, and then type, without quotes, &quot;pb_sleep500&quot;. Hit Enter.<br />Step 4: Without closing the console, type &quot;pb_writecfg&quot; to save the change. <br /><br />Your lag spikes should be much less frequent, if happening at all. <br /><br />Rename BF2.exe<br />Although although nobody knows why this fix improves the gameplay , but I belive is probably that Ati and Nvidia recognise BF2.exe as a game, so by renaming the file, you turn the game into a normal program, not the memory-hogging beast we know it as. Most people see some jump in performance after doing this.<br /><br />Step 1: The first thing you do is find your game directory, the default is C:\Program Files\EA Games\Battlefield 2 .<br />Step 2: Find BF2.exe, and right-click on it. Select &quot;Properties&quot;. <br />Step 3: Now rename it to anything you like, but keep it simple so you can revert back later if need be.<br />Step 4: Before you tell me it dosn&#039;t work, change the shortcut on your desktop to reflect the new name. ;)<br /><br />Run BF2 as a High-Priority application<br />Step 1: Go back to the BF2 folder. <br />Step 2: Right click anywhere in the folder and click &quot;New&quot; then &quot;Text Document&quot;.<br />Step 3: Right click on the newly created file and rename it to bf2.bat, The file should then turn into a little cog. If it doesn&#039;t, you will need to uncheck the &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot; option in Tools&gt;Folder Options&gt;View.<br />Step 4: Edit your new BAT file, and paste in:<br /><br />PHP Code:<br />@echo off&nbsp; <br />cd /d &quot;C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\Battlefield 2&quot;&nbsp; <br />start /high BF2.exe +menu 1 +fullscreen 1&nbsp; <br /><br />Then save, but if you edied your BF2.exe&#039;s name in the last tweak, reflect that change here. Also, direct your Desktop shortcuts to the BAT file.<br /><br />Manualy update PunkBuster<br />Punkbuster, the anti-cheat/anti-hack tool in many games, including BF2, is suposed to auto-update itself, but it rarley does, and old PB files can cause frequent connection errors in online play. You can manualy update PB with the application here: http://www.evenbalance.com/index.php...upport-bf2.php<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

Coz if you don&#039;t then IMO it has got to be more boring then the official bf 2 ranked servers.<br />It may take me and gunner ten million years but the fun and the hunger for hard ranks, will always be more on our side. <br /><br />It&#039;s all thanks to ergin that I&#039;m still able to play at all. Does anyone care for ranks? I always was attracted to the realism of the game. (Oh and the hype we get from unlocking a new weapon, lol) :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">so spicy!<br />you had to get into the old discussion heh??<br />And by the way if I play 1000000 hrs and dont get my points, then there is no promotion.At your server you get your ranks after how much time( or points) you have played.In other words, you dont have to kill,revieve etc.&nbsp; get points to get promoted hey hey hey , thats cool man 8)I think I park here for 400 hrs and then I`M a GENERAL. :P<br /><br />well enough of that discussion righty?<br /><br />I think ranking is a good way to say , ok you done fine, you earned it.I also like the fun of the game ,but also to get those rewards too. Scar I agree with&nbsp; you,One shot should do it.<br /><br />I have one question,how come someone kill me with 2 shot eg. anti tank and when I try it takes at least 4-5 shot? then same goes for when I`m in an APC vs APC.<br /><br />cybo commader</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try from very lowest settings on everything first. Sound Card plays a huge role also. Does it lag when you get showered with artillery? or just lagging on everything? I&#039;m running it on a 3000+ and 5500 still with no lag on low sets 800x600 70hrz...unless i&#039;m on a crappy server with a 250 ping.<br /><br />Although, with a 5500 256 mg. I don&#039;t even attempt to go any higher on graphics than low,that&#039;s just how graphic card heavy the game is.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t know why it doesn&#039;t show up on dxdiag, but the card is actually a Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Digital, so it&#039;s not a half bad card (not the half best, either).<br /><br />Airstrikes and artillery equals immense lag. The worse though is when you go into the near-death/explosion mode and it goes blurry.<br /><br />But besides that, the gameplay is choppy at best. I&#039;m going to XP Pro x64-bit in a few days, and looking at prices I&#039;m actually going for the 512MB GeForce 7800 because the 7900 is still too expensive for me to buy and throw out for a dx10 card come January.<br /><br />But I just don&#039;t know how it can be *this* bad..</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ghost, unfortunately a 6100 is really just a word-processor card, in this instance it might even be better to have scar&#039;s 5500FX. Anything below a 6600 is not going to cut it for new games these days, however if you are looking for a new card and plan to upgrade as soon as possible to DX10 I would recommend getting a 7600gt because as of now that&#039;s the card where you will get the most bang for your buck, and it can play all the latest games at maximum or near maximum settings to boot.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">2142 may turn out to be nice.<br /><br />But I would recommend&nbsp; QUAKE: Enemy Territory instead.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because BF 2142 is just gonna be more of the same old same old, with some tweaks of course.&nbsp; Basically a re-skinned BF2 with some new features.<br /><br />But QUAKE: Enemy Territory is going to be revolutionary in gameplay, mechanics, and graphics.<br /><br />For instance, Humans will have medics that can revive.&nbsp; But the Alien enemy will have medics who cant revive but can assimilate corpses of humans into spawn points for dead comrades.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another cool feature is that vehicles will be designed realistically.&nbsp; So if you shoot the back wheel off of a 4-wheeler it will just go around in circles and be useless. <br /><br />Humans will have chooper-like aircraft with constant speed and maneuverability that we are used to.&nbsp; Aliens will have anti-grav choppers that are more maneuverable at low altitudes but slow and less maneuverable at high altitudes.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />But probably the most important feature of all is the sequential capping system.&nbsp; &nbsp;No more BS of having someone fly a plane over enemy lines, parachute out, and take a cap point solo.&nbsp; No more having spread out fights all over the map with 2-3 people in each fight.<br /><br />Now you will have both armies clashing at the same cap point. (just like in Valve&#039;s TFC, oh the memories) &nbsp; You will still be able to go behind enemy lines and disrupt supplies or spawning .... but no more cheap ass one man capping behind lines.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The map wont be linear but the capping system will be.&nbsp; You will start at your HQ and start taking cap points closest to you as you enemy will do the same.&nbsp; You should meet somewhere in the center and the epic clashes that we lack in BF2 will finally exist.&nbsp; To be honest i am getting tired of 10 different conflicts spread over a map with 2-3 persons in each conflict in BF2. I wanna see all the tanks and all the planes and all the troops duke it out for the finale.&nbsp; Cant wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh but thats just my humble opinion on basic facts that are known about the game from an interview with John Carmack the developer.&nbsp; If you are a google-slave with subnormal intelligence who cant think for himself and has no idea what it is he is looking for in a game, you may need to wait for a paid reviewer to first play the game for 2 hours, and then assign it a percentile score before you consider buying it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AC<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with the statement that BF, either 2 or 4215 (or what ever number it is, I cant be bothered to scroll to check !) will be pretty similar, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, a new angle on a recipe that works might be good for EA and some players, but I already have BF2, I dont go around playing lots of games, I prefer to enjoy a few good ones I find.<br /><br />I disagree that there are no epic battles in BF2. I think there can be and at times there arent. They are not forced and they are not always garuanteed, but they do occur, especially when the maps split like on Karkand where the mec are pushed back tot he bridge and snipers and medics have a field day.<br /><br />Perhaps have a more forced face on huge battle will be fun, but personally I prefer it as it is with BF2. Maybe I know no better, but then ignorance is bliss :P.<br /><br />Basically the big battles depends on players and commanders mindsets.</div>

BUT the bridge at karkand is probably the best chokepoint BF2 has to offer ... and yet i dont really consider sniping and reviving to be all that epic.&nbsp; Sure you do get big fights in the middle of the map sometimes... but that is often dissolved by the cheap one-man capping in a dune buggy.<br /><br />Many times as a commander i have seen it happening on the satellite.&nbsp; I will see the two main forces clash and i will think... oh this is great.&nbsp; But on my satellite scan i will see that one prick who drove solo in a buggy or van to some cap point 60 miles behind the main fight and cap it.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden the big clash going on dissolves and everyone scatters across the entire map in a frenzy of Flag capping.&nbsp; Its like the flag-capping version of &quot;whack-a-mole&quot;.<br /><br />It gets to the point sometimes where people are more interested in running around capping flags in buggies and choopers (like headless chickens) than they are at really fighting.<br /><br />In QUAKE: Enemy territory&nbsp; i think perhaps the forced face-offs will encourage more actual &quot;fighting&quot; than just trying to swipe a flag.&nbsp; Perhaps this will limit freedom a bit, as in BF2 you have the freedom to drive your buggy up the side of a mountain and fire your sniper rifle at the sun for 10 minutes and not have it really affect the outcome of the battle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whereas with Quake: Enemy Territory, if you arent on the front lines with the rest of your mates you&#039;ll eventually be camped in your HQ sucking down 50cal. of cold hard lead.<br /><br /><br />AC</div>

When it says 300&nbsp; vs 300, each ticket represents a human life.&nbsp; So if you kill 50 of them they go down to 250. SO there are two ways to win.&nbsp; And i&#039;m not complaining about flag capping.... just that when teamwork and combat are forsaken for cheap flag swipes.&nbsp; Plus when someone caps a flag waaaaay behind enemy teritory... it makes everyone panic and they start scattering about.<br /><br />Sure its fun for the guy who does the behind the line capping (yea i&#039;ve done it), but its detrimental to the game in that it dilutes bigger conflicts into smaller firefights.&nbsp; Which is why i sorta like it when we have the enemy trapped at their uncappable HQ, because then its a forced face off.<br /><br />That doesnt mean ther eis a right way or wrong way to enjoy battle FPS games.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying i hope Enemy Territory delivers something i have been waiting 6 years for.&nbsp; Last time i played a game that forced epic face offs was Team Fortress Classic from Valve back in 2000.&nbsp; (Was packaged with Half Life 1)<br /><br />If you arent familiar with TFC, try this link&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_Classic <br /><br />It was the first great team based battle FPS game.&nbsp; God how i miss it.&nbsp; Looking back at the graphics now makes me chuckle.&nbsp; There was supposed to be a TFC2 but it was delayed until HL2 engine came out and people still dont know if it will be made.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Man how i miss Dustbowl map with those gates that would raise up hehe.&nbsp; I also miss the spy class.&nbsp; Wish BF2 had something like that.&nbsp; Was fun infiltrating enemy base disguised as one of them and then stabbing flag-guard in the back<br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Spyboth.PNG)Spy<br />&nbsp;<br /><i>The Spy (new model left, old model right)The stealth assassin of TFC, this class has fairly light armor and average speed, but has the unique ability to disguise himself as a member of an opposing team. His &quot;special skill&quot; button brings up the disguise menu, letting the player choose what team and what class he would like to appear to be. Enemy sentry guns will not fire on a Spy disguised as a member of that team, making them very capable of penetrating a base&#039;s defense. A disguised Spy can also position himself behind an unwary enemy to deliver an instant-kill stab (in the back of the head) with his knife. Attacking with the knife or firing any weapon causes the Spy to lose his disguise, but tossing grenades does not, making Spies ultimate sentry gun killers. The Spy can also feign death, letting him bide his time as a corpse while he changes disguise and plans his next move. Geared more for offensive support, the Spy is one of the most challenging classes to play effectively, but a skilled Spy can be very disruptive against the enemy team. Even suspicion of a Spy in the enemy team&#039;s midst can create a gaping hole in an organized defense, as defenders waste ammo shooting each other for &quot;Spy checks&quot; (enemy Spies still visibly bleed if damaged) or are lured out of position. However, this class lacks the speed, armor, and weaponry to hold in a straight-up shootout against most other classes, and any contact with an opposing team&#039;s Scout or Spy will expose him.<br /><br />Another potent weapon available only to this class is the gas grenade, which has a temporary hallucinatory effect, causing enemies to see and hear phantom explosions, shots, flames and tossed grenades for a short period of time. This relatively harmless effect masks the fairly moderate damage over time the grenade causes while an enemy is in its area of effect. In large doses, Spy gas (or Fairy Dust) can cause severe damage.<br /><br />Rounding out the Spy&#039;s unique arsenal is the tranquilizer pistol, which fires a special dart that does negligible damage, but greatly reduces its target&#039;s rate of movement temporarily. It&#039;s best used on faster classes to facilitate a lethal knife strike. The Spy is also armed with the double-barreled shotgun, nail gun, and up to 4 normal grenades.</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AC<br /><br /></div>

The good old days where making music videos to medics and scouts conc-jumping around rediculous areas was cool, and people oo-ed and ahhh-ed when skinners would replace the skins with cell-shading characters, or 2-d characters. Those were peaceful times&nbsp; :D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just think BF2 vanilla will be a damn hard act to follow. I just hope this new futuristic one is as good or the same, but again I somehow doubt that. I really think they shoulda improved the original BF2, god knows theres alot to fix. They should combine SF with BF2 and have some nighttime karkand games. Just my opinion, or a New York city map in the heart of the city were you can choose nittime or daytime via servers. can you imagine grappling onto those buildings? I mean all these nittime maps with SF blow goats, use that crap on different often played city maps. just imagine grappling or zip-lining on karkand. Plus it&#039;s not that hard to kill thos ziplining.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Like I said before, imagine how nice it would be to implement the grappling hook and zipline to Karkand, and similar maps....omg all those buildings. I don&#039;t see how it would make it unbalanced if snipers and some others could have it in their kit. BTW it&#039;s not all that easy using them say on a map like karkand either. They are merely tools, not weapons. I also think that playing anti-tank kit<br />firing a single guided rocket at the tanks track should stop it, or from behind. and the last thing for me would be this...if I shoot a hovering hele at a flag or anywhere onm the chopper for that matter with a damn tank it should come down, a direct hit not just smoke a little and it flies away for repairs. I mean thats realistic.&nbsp; Hell, iraqi made nades on a rocket brings down a blackhawk. If an M95 can take out a pilot through his cockpit glass, then an armor piercing tank round should pwn the whole thing.<br /><br />For instance,<br /><br /><br />Dragon Weapon System<br /><br /><br />Primary function: Anti-armor weapon system<br />ManBuilder: McDonnell Douglas Aerospace and Missile Systems and Raytheon<br />Length:<br />Launcher: 45.4 inches (115.32 cm)<br />Missile: 33.3 inches (84.58 centimeters)<br />Weight:<br />Ready to Fire: 33.9 lbs (Day Tracker)<br />48.7 lbs (Night Tracker)<br />Day Tracker (Sights): 6.75 lbs<br />Thermal Night Tracker (w/1 bottle and battery): 21.65 lbs<br />Maximum effective range: 3281 feet (1000 meters)<br />Time of flight: 11.2 seconds<br />Armor penetration: Will defeat T-55, T-62, or T-72 w/o added armor<br />Unit Replacement Cost:<br />Night Tracker System: $51,000<br />Day Tracker System: $13,000<br /><br />Mission: Primary: To engage and destroy armor and light armored vehicles. Secondary: defeat hard targets such as bunkers and field fortifications.<br /><br />Features: The warhead power of Dragon makes it possible for a single Marine to defeat armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, concrete gun emplacements, or other hard targets. The launcher consists of a smoothbore fiberglass tube, breech/gas generator, tracker and support, bipod, battery, sling, and forward and aft shock absorbers. Non-integral day and night sights are required to utilize the Dragon.<br />The complete system consists of the launcher, the tracker and the missile, which is installed in the launcher during final assembly and received by the Marine Corps in a ready to fire condition. The launch tube serves as the storage and carrying case for the missile. The night tracker operates in the thermal energy range.<br /><br />Inventory:<br />Day tracker: 1055<br />Night tracker: 923<br /><br />Background: The first-generation Dragon, a 1000-meter system requiring 11.2 seconds flight-to-target time, was developed for the US Army and fielded in 1970. A product improvement program (PIP) was initiated by the Marine Corps in 1985 and managed by NSWC Dahlgren. The PIP, designated Dragon II, was designed to increase warhead penetration effectiveness by 85%. The Dragon II missile is actually a retrofit of warheads to the first generation missiles already in the Marine Corps inventory..<br /><br />(http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y139/skr5150/helico3.gif)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Vanilla bf2 will NEVER be dead, it will only get better..granted i&#039;m not too crazy about some of the<br />booster packs (tank maps). this is one of those games that come along once in a blue moon and is never the same. for instance Doom 3 I loved it but once I played it on all th levels of difficulties and for alternate endings. After that everyting was predictable.&nbsp; BF2 is just never the same no matter how many times you play it. <br /><br />Just face the facts, EA and Dice created a killer game and as long as they keep it patched and updated, it will conntinue to be a solid gold game. The amount of online players speaks for that alone. I myself am not too crazy about futuristic bf2, but like gun said it may turn out to be a killer game. By the way, does anyone else like that little chopper like the one opn the map Road Rage lol they should have those in every map.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they would do is implement all the other weapons from SF etc.for all maps.<br />and a few of those small choppers on karkand,or Sharqi with grapping hooks, zips and maybe a nightime karkand map with night-vision goggles. that would kick ass. Also myabe introduce a sniper rifle with night-vision scope. ah yea!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been over a month since I played BF2 now. Since I went back in time with my HD image I havent setup BF2 correctly, plus I had issues with Xfire not working ingame, so I guess its a good time to reinstall all 1.5+GB of it :P<br /><br />Probably be busy for another month at least as well, so might get a record 2 months of no play on BF2. Ocassionally I get a quick game of Emp going but thats very rare too. I only play that becuase its relatively quick !</div>

Even the rank I have now is only around 50% of promotions, hence about 50% of finishing the game rank wise. And Spicy by that I mean the official rankings. Plus they are still updating and patching which is nice with new maps....when they abandon vanilla then I might try it out and buy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is based on the same engine, no ? But a Mod usually requires the original, so it cant be a mod (unless of course, it does require the original [BF2] in which case I missed a lot of stuff while being away).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />&nbsp;true.. but pkm and support weapons are different category from the light machine gun category witch<br />i am saying here....<br />plus pkm is a long range gun and its not fast at all ..it weight 16 kilos so it will slow you down<br />and you need to prone before you shoot...and by this time a good shot on the head from the g3 will<br />do the job on close encounters</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />&nbsp;its not about power only..what so great about g3 is the accuracy which gives you a high advantage against any other shooters specially when you get used to aim with it...<br />i dunno about the shot guns.. i I&#039;ve been killed with one shot a lots of times and with different kinds of shot guns as well as i remember clearly making one single shot kills with the ordinary one single shot&nbsp; engineer shot gun but from very close range..just a matter of practice..<br />the shot guns are not a primary weapon in open battle like bf2 anyway...<br />and usually used by police&nbsp; for short range encounters...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All support guns are light machine guns. They just have less recoil than others each other.<br />If your a veteran with support then you&#039;ll know that you don&#039;t need to prone when firing long range or short. It&#039;s all about the short burst for long and the rapid fire for close. G3 is an all rounder gun aswell so it can also fire long range.<br />PKM maybe slow to us firing it, but have you seen how fast the bullets come out from the front view by changing it with the &#039;C&#039; button while firing? 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">And does anyone know if the Mg36(sf support unlock) is any lighter than the PKM and the M249?<br />The bullet radius from a Mg36 is sweet, as it sprays bullets in a close nit circle, so there&#039;s more chance killing someone with rapid fire from long and medium range.<br />If it has to be without a stand then yes I agree with the G3. I always make use of the tear gas grenade going down that hill from USMC side as it helps my team mates from getting shot at while they run down with me. ;)</div>

Just take a look at Amazon&#039;s page (http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Arts-15265-Battlefield-DVD-ROM/dp/B000GPXS9O/sr=8-1/qid=1161208582/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1828798-0070550?ie=UTF8) for the game, only 1.5 stars out of 5 and the price has already dropped 5 dollars.</div>

ETQW is fundamentally built with the goal of creating gameplay where teamwork makes a significant difference in whether or not you complete objectives. The game is also unique in pitting asymmetrical forces against one another; Its no longer just a choice between two similar but differently-named machine guns: the choice of whether to play Strogg or GDF is significant, the strategies are different, and the experience is different. ETQWs builds on Wolf ETs successful team play approach that has won millions of fans the world over, but is set a century after those World War II battles. It pits the Allied troops of the Global Defence Force against their most horrific threat yet - the Strogg invasion of Earth, set in the epic QUAKE universe - a conventional human military force taking on the marauding Strogg with their alien technology. <br /><br /><br />http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=132507<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(http://www.computerandvideogames.com/medialib/screens/screenshot_152807.jpg)<br /><br /><br />(http://www.computerandvideogames.com/medialib/screens/screenshot_152805.jpg)<br /><br /><br />(http://www.computerandvideogames.com/medialib/screens/screenshot_152810.jpg)<br /><br /><br />(http://www.computerandvideogames.com/medialib/screens/screenshot_152806.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone thought about wether EA could have added a threeway war consisting of all 3 army&#039;s in one game as a special add on maybe?<br />Each army would have a spawn flag to start with and in the centre could be some neutral spawn flags to capture.<br />The colour of the enemy nicks would still be the same for all 3 teams as you would all be fighting 2 enemy&#039;s. <br />I also believe this would be fantastic to give away as an extra something to get MORE players to play vanilla bf2 (and for those of us who already have it.)<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas like these they might want to share about the joys of v.bf2? 8)<br /><br />10 more posts and we&#039;ve made 1000 posts for this thread!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">New patch ready for download.<br /><br />Things continue to move within the Battlefield Universe. Today we are releasing the 1.41 patch for Battlefield 2 that resolves an intermittent crash that affected game servers. Although this is a small update this improvement will greatly improve the stability for players. This patch will be available beginning at 4:00pm GMT. <br /><br />Our support staff has begun to address the accounts of players who use exploit tactics to advance themselves. Stats acquired through the use of exploits will be removed while accounts that show extreme abuse are subject to a complete stats wipe. We will also be announcing policy changes regarding player cheating and stats exploit in the near future. <br /><br />As always keep your eyes to this space for all your Battlefield Updates,<br /><br />cybocommander<br />_________________<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried logging in after a long break, and I was shocked at the number of servers I saw. Now there are only about 500 servers around!? The Singapore servers I used to go to are barely full. They&#039;re 32-player servers, but they are often only almost half full.<br /><br />Is this game dying, or it&#039;s just my game screwing up with the servers list, or both?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One thing I would suggest is gettting the EA dloader. Honestly when I use that it takes no time hardly at all to get these patches vs. using some site. It also utilizes the torrent way of dloading so its way faster. I always use it. I got the 500 meg dload in about 20 minutes.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got the last 500 meg dload, and I have no problems with getting tons of servers. So if it&#039;s another 500 meger, then no I haven&#039;t got it yet. it&#039;s perfect the way it is now to me anyway. I still get thousands of servers just fine without it. I don&#039;t guite understand what this new patch entails, but I&#039;m not dloading it yet, unless all BF2 players get it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Patch Update Version 1.41 (officially released on November 16, 2006). The patch includes only one bug fix: &quot;Fixed an extremely intermittent server crash bug.&quot; There is no Linux version or incremental version of this patch. This patch would be the only patch for BF2 that was made by the original development team.<br /><br />The above was taken from Wikipedia. Man, it only fixes one small thing ? omg fags&nbsp; :-X</div>

And yes seargant ranks are many different ones before you get to the bars of Luet. Anyone who plays the game will tell you the same. I mean after this I have to get Master Gunnery Seargant, then 1 other one, then it&#039;s Luet. Not to mention all the awards you have to achieve before you can even become eligable for a promo.</div>

Then scroll down to badges and it&#039;s toward the bottom. Look for the ones you don&#039;t have that req. you to get them playing on SF maps. I used Warlord map to get the grappling hook badge and the zip-line badge. Just spawn at he uncap base and do it on any building 10 times, then switch to sniper and use the zip-line ten times.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also have a good tip for anyone using sniper kit, or any other for that matter. Say your next to a short wall crouched down, don&#039;t lay right next to the wall but stay about oh,3 feet away or else the enemy can ID you even if your crouched down, and know where you are to sneek up on you. Also as sniper, never get up on buildings or that damn crane, thats the first place the enemy looks when they hear the sniper rifle pop-off.<br /><br />Also the sniper kit pistol is by far the best one there is, nice and quiet, and fast shooting. I also will use my claymores placed right in front of my face facing forward since the blast goes forward not everywhere, it wont hurt you at all. Then one placed behind me. and always displace after a few min. cause your never invisible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;I actually haven&#039;t played SF hardly at all. Not since me and Gun and some others were on teamspeak way back. I just started playing it some the other day again. I like the map Warlord out of the SF the best though. As for Euro Forces, I can&#039;t remember the last time I played it. I just remember those little small choppers were really nice. You could put a support guy on one side and an anti-tank guy on the other side and kick ass with one of those little heles. I wish they had those in vanilla BF2.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">oh man oh man...<br /><br />I just got 42 kills as sniper on Warlord, a SF forces map, of course. Didnt get a drumroll or nothing. No badge, no recognition of some serious killing as sniper. It was a mix of claywhores and my trusty M95 (POW!), say about 35 of those kills would be M95.<br /><br />42 Kills, 16 Deaths...nice. Shame there was nothing in the end. Wonder if they have to all be kills with the gun ?<br /><br />Or &#039;nades dont count ? There were a few naders in there. Y&#039;know when you cant snipe cos he is too far away and moving fast/random, you pull out your mess-maker and let it do its job&nbsp; ;).<br /><br />-= EDIT=- <br /><br />Its 2 years and 1 month to the day that I purchased BF2 !

All I need now is my own copy of vanilla bf 2 and x-fire and I&#039;ll be part of the =FD2K= crew but that is not going to happen soon as I&#039;m still trying out the free sf weapons that are allowed in this IBC server, lol.<br /><br />One thing this server will really change me is the extreme bunny hopping, even when capturing a spawn point. :P<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to join you guys on EA. ::)<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dont know if I can do that feat again. It does take some doing !<br /><br />I am not sure I will have to do it again though, that doesnt seem right.<br /><br />I think it is easier on a 1/3rd full server, as I said before I would try it on one, but in the end I succeeded on a 64 player full one...or was it 32 ? Either way, it was a busy inf only server.<br /><br />The hardest badge to get will probably be pistol, 5 kills in a round. I know I will get poped way before that unless I go kamakazi, which I will not do ! I cant hurt my K/D ratio !<br /><br />Currently only able to play weekends, mostly Saturday nights.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just use the sniper pistol, it&#039;s fast and quiet. They never know were it&#039;s coming from unless they see you. I mean I can pop off like 9 rounds with that thing in no time. The only downside to it is it has no aiming sites but like I said before, i&#039;ve sniped with it from long distances when I ran out of sniper rifle ammo. It&#039;s fun watching them look all around for whats hitting them with that pistol.&nbsp; ;)</div>

He won&#039;t have slim pickings to choose from now he will have more than he can ask for. Now you&#039;ll just have trouble picking from so many and which one you want to play on.&nbsp; :) <br /><br />Spicy, imagine your server screen actually filling up and then being able to scroll down also choosing from many servers. That&#039;s the difference in the 2. Well, that and all the bugs, and the&nbsp; cheesy ranking system&nbsp; :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;I think he wants to be able to play with us on the real EA ranked servers is all i&#039;m getting at. And you cannot do that with a copied version. I don&#039;t know about the rest that play, but my browser setting is set so that I get only ranked, and basically the same copy and version as mine. I usually can load up around 800 servers give or take everyday. It&#039;s also set so that the games are all pretty much full. So it&#039;s all left to what server I feel like jumping into. See spicy, I could play with you on one of those servers your at, but you cannot play on the ones I use{the mainstream EA ranked servers}. Not to mention the Xfire factor where you can just turn that on, see your buddies playing and just join them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can confirm that that was the biggest concern when choosing whether or not to go proper EA or Antik server way.<br /><br />Yes, I can also confirm muds didnt understand about the servers, and kept complaining about bunny hopping, which I am sure they did, but it wasnt antik servers (proper servers that mimic normal bf2 servers...vanilla, shall we say).<br /><br />He kept gettting serial key not recognised on antik servers, and despite doing what you advised spiz, it wasnt happening.<br /><br />He was getting impatient, and is about as computer literate as mordman, i,e. not a fucking clue. So telling him to change things when he couldnt log on was not going to happen. It (dodgy servers) was only done to let me try it out and see if his computer was up to it. So now he has the real deal and xfire too (&quot;madenod&quot;) so he should be joining us soon.<br /><br />Alls well that ends well...<br /><br />And scar, I do feel sorry for spizdude, he really has no real alternative, other then perhaps not play, and thats not very nice. The ranking system is wierd, but then so are most Europeans :P<br /><br />Thanks spizgirl, for trying and helping even though muds didnt once say thanks to either of us ;)</div>

I could&#039;nt tell what to do as things were happening so fast and I lost my chance to test the tear gas pipe grenade. <br /><br />I&#039;m not so sure about the sf weapons aswell, the MG36 IMO is not as good as the PKM afterall coz it can&#039;t kill as quick in any range. <br />The FN2000 is the same for it&#039;s damage is poor compared to the G3, with slow rate of fire and flash bangs are a turn off.<br />I&#039;ve&nbsp; hardly seen anyone use a flash bang for a while now. :o</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;Hey guys, I&#039;ll be back playing soon as i&#039;ve been busy building new PC, and am currently waiting on my new OS to arrive. However I did load up xp pro copied vers. and BF2 just to see how it will play. OMG this video card rocks,now I know what i&#039;ve been missing in game, the details are awesome, the default settings in BF2 video options for this card are set to all medium and a few on high. No lag what so ever, this 7300/512 card is amazing. It&#039;s like a giant heatsink the size of the card with connector pins showing. So I should be loaded up and playing agian in a few days.</div>

I always spot them. In fact, even if I am not sure if they are there I try to guess-spot them as the game allows you to be inaccurate, it will find the nearest enemy for you ! (within reason)</div>

That is if the are all squaded up as they are suppose to be.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />As for my upgrade I&#039;ve been playing basic BF2 without the patches etc. to see how it does. man it&#039;s awesome with this new card...I will have my brand new legit Win xp home full version OEM tommorrow.<br />So I should see you guys again by tommorrow night at the latest.</div>

Yes I just overclocked my vid card from 450 gpu to 530 and memory from 1.0 gigs to 1.3 man this card runs great.I used the Coolbits that came with the drivers and used the optimum settings and then tested it. Although it has a massive heatsink, I rigged a nice 80mm fan to blow towards the cards heatsink. it doesen&#039;t get any hotter than around 60 degrees f. after running BF2 for a while.<br />I love it.&nbsp; :D Running on a AMD 64 3400+ venice @2.6 mgrhz. I haven&#039;t touched the FSB for overclocking yet. Also got a asus chilly vent cooler with heatpipes. Man it&#039;s so dman quiet I actually have to look sometimes to tell if it&#039;s on. Stays at a cool 84 degrees F.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, thanks for that. It was fun playing there, unfortunately we ran out of players as the day wore on. Being a UK clan means that timing will match my own well (I am UK based [London]).<br /><br />Most of the =XCU= Clan are good, and I was often getting killed by the buggers :P.<br /><br />Was great, maybe I will play there more just cos the level of skill was good.<br /><br />Only problem I had was once our commander was a bit of a twat, and just ran around fighting, no UAV, no nothing. Enemy commander was good, fighting and commanding. I took over next round or two and we did alright.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, thats what I&#039;m talking about! Commanders who are sleeping and commanders who are active.<br /><br />Sleeping commander: Not much UAV. Absolutely no scan. supplys himself most of the time while he&#039;s fighting.<br /><br />Active commander: Uav capturing asmuch of the enemy as possible. SCANS after UAV finishes and any enemy&#039;s outside the UAV radius. supplys dropped at places where ally&#039;s are approaching. Fighting while doing all these things.<br /><br />And then it&#039;s the squads. I have noticed that when a team loses a game like yesterdays. The next round noone wants to make a squad or wants to be commander even if a few have dropped out coz their deaths have risen.<br /><br />This is what cost me 45 deaths, don&#039;t get me wrong, I love to get in the thick of battle and shine the PKM at 10 people at once, but when a squad leader is not paying attention to the other side of the map and is staying far back then it&#039;s costing the team and my deaths as I&#039;m fighting 3 people on my own and everyones camping in the last spawn point for the MEC side. :o<br /><br />It is so pivital to have a squad that really goes together and fly&#039;s everywhere. 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hello all thought id post regarding some of your queries <br /><br />1. battlefield 2142<br /><br />about half of the clan own and play this game but not as much as bf2 I&#039;ve done about 250 hours and am brig general but as I&#039;m not likely to get a higher rank i went back to bf2 our server is capable of running bf2142 but at the moment we are sticking to bf2. what i am saying is we play it but not as much as normal bf there might be some more people play it soon as 2142 northern strike is out soon and is a really really good game.<br /><br />2. sharqi<br /><br />we don&#039;t currently run sharqi in the map rotation not cause we don&#039;t like it it is as u say a very good map what we are trying to do is get our clan and server known for being the place to go for a variety of maps rather than the usual suspects we keep karkand on as its a good map to get people interested in staying on the server and then play on the ones less used by peeps but when u get to know them they are good maps also.<br />as for sharqi i will probably add it in the coming days and replace jalalabab as its a map that normally empties our server.<br /><br />anyway hope that answers some of your questions if you want the ts2 details ask madenod as he has the server address and password.<br /><br />on another note Acriku if u regestered on our forum i think i deleted you by mistake so u will have to re reg lol any questions please xfire me<br /><br />xfire boon1977<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t think i&#039;ll be playing 2142 anytime soon. I mean i&#039;m still only roughly just over half-way done with vanilla BF2 and it&#039;s still as fun as it was when I first started playing it. I will try it out after I&#039;m done with vanilla BF2. I mean honestly, it does not seem like i&#039;ve played BF2 for as long as I have. It seems to just get better and better each time I log on and play. I am also glad they fixed all of the horrible exploits that stopped me from playing it for a bit. Like the hotel bug on karkand. Man when I found out by accident how bad that really was, I was pissed. Thank god they fixed that one. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I went ape-sh*t trying to figure out who the hell was shooting me at the hotel over and over.I&#039;m not crazy about EA, but I will give them thumbs up for at least fixing those bugs.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;I mentioned this once before,but I really think just 1 of those small heles for each main base that they have on road rage would be awesome for Karkand or&nbsp; alot of other maps. I really do think they are the perfect balanced,not overpowered but just right hele there is in BF2. I mean the ones that look like a small news chopper with machine guns. Man those are just all around fun to fly. It&#039;s a shame it&#039;s only available on the crappy maps. I would also love to see them somehow incorporate the SF grappling hook and zip line for maps like karkand. Ahh, so much to grapple and zip-line on karkand . For inf. only that would rock. I don&#039;t think it would unbalance it at all but improve the fun and a newer skill level.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy !<br />It could be that you drop your flares, but I`ll bet the other pilot lock on you to force you to drop the flares, then he fire the missile. :o I do anyway ::)<br />As for choppers, wait till you are close fire your gun instead small burst at a time, this goes for jets too. Missiles lock makes youre alarm ring, gunner don`t need I say more?<br /><br />Original by Oakenfold @ krackouse.net <br /><br /><br />In this comprehensive guide, I will cover the basics of flight, targeting, dog fighting, bombing, and how to make sure nobody ever punishes you for the inevitable accidental TKs emitted from your jet. Well, maybe minus the part about the tk punishing. Nothing short of atomic weapons will get rid of punishers. In addition to the basics, we will go over some more advanced subjects. To top it off, we will show you how to use moves(not the human-missile-in-the-mountain move you noob) to be a better pilot in Battlefield 2. <br /><br />SECTION ONE: PREFLIGHT <br /><br />What should I have if I want to be feared in the air? <br />1-Joystick. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Joystick pilots reign. <br />2-Good soundcard, with headphones or good 5.1/7.1 speakers. <br />3-The in-game graphics setting &quot;Effects&quot; on high. This makes contrails much more visible. <br />4-A good team that will spot vehicles on the map for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />SECTION TWO: LIFT OFF! BASIC FLIGHT <br /><br />Throttle <br />As mentioned in Section One, a joystick is a must for being a great jet pilot. Some people may contend that they are very good with mouse/keyboard, but dont listen to them. Theyre idiots. Stop reading this guide and go by a stick. <br /><br />With a keyboard, you are either at full throttle, 0% throttle, or -100% throttle. With a joystick, you can accurately set your throttle to 60%, or -30%, making your ability to maneuver and pull off trickier moves far greater than any keyboard/mouse pilot. <br /><br />Throttle Hint: On all jets except the F35, full back on the throttle is not 0%. It is full reverse. To go to 0% throttle on any jet, you need to have your throttle control in the middle on your joystick. Full reverse comes in very hand when you need to slow down quickly. <br /><br />On the American F35 Strike Fighter, full reverse changes the direction of the engines instead of applying full reverse throttle. <br /><br />Control Surfaces <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />In a jet, constant air movement against control surfaces is essential for maneuvering. Control surfaces on jets include ailerons(bank left/right), rudder(Left/Right Yaw), and elevator(Pitch up/down). <br /><br />The ailerons are typically controlled by pushing the joystick you bought before coming into section two left or right. This will control your roll, or bank. Pushing left or right on your stick will cause your plane to roll that direction, but not necessarily change heading(aka compass direction). <br /><br />Elevator is your pitch up and down, typically up and down on your joystick. This changes your angle of attack, meaning the angle to which your nose is pointing up or down on the horizon. In Battlefield 2, you can now monitor your angle of attack by observing the artificial horizon bar on your HUD. <br /><br />Rudder is the most overlooked and underused control surface. It controls your yaw, easily explained by this example: <br />Imagine a pole is shoved through the center of your plane, inserted into the top and coming out of the bottom. Rudder will essentially rotate your jet around that pole. This is why steering on the ground is done using the rudder instead of the ailerons. Rudder mastery is essential for more advanced maneuvers, and even many beginner maneuvers. <br /><br />Basic Flight <br /><br />While airborne in your sparkly new jet, combinations of control surface changes cause the plane to maneuver. <br /><br />To turn quickly and effectively, you need to combine all the control surfaces. By banking to the left 80 degrees, pulling back on the stick 100%, and applying full to medium left rudder, your turning radius will be dramatically smaller than if you chose to apply only a single control surface. This is obviously essential for dog fighting. If you want to feel like Maverick in Top Gun(sans the F14, damn you EA), you need to practice turning quickly. Try throttling down for a moment prior to entering the turn, and then using after burner(more on this later). This will also decrease your turning radius. <br /><br />Diving and climbing are as important as turning, and a foundation to the rest of the maneuvers in this guide. To a small extent, your speed is affected by your angle of attack. If youre climbing, you wont gain much speed. However if you are diving, it is important to know that you will be gaining speed. <br /><br />While diving, be sure to pay close attention to your altitude. Otherwise, start practicing your l33t parachuting skillz. <br /><br />Practice using heavy rudder no matter what maneuver you are trying for, and over time, your agility as a pilot will increase exponentionally because of this.<br />go practice and I`ll be back with more<br />&nbsp;<br />end of lesson one + two 8)<br /><br />point man cybo<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here are some more homework lads and girlz.<br />I really do not know what kind of&nbsp; missiles they are( brand),but the manual says only heat seeking missiles.<br />I found out this bout the real J-10 jets:<br />Armament<br />Guns: 1× 23 mm internal cannon <br />Hardpoints: 11, 3 under each wing and 5 under the fuselage <br />Missiles: <br />Air-to-air: PL-8, PL-11, PL-12 <br />Air-to-surface: PJ-9, YJ-9K, 90mm unguided rocket launcher pods <br />Bombs: laser-guided bombs (LT-2), glide bombs (LS-6) and unguided bombs <br />http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/pl-8.htm<br /><br />SECTION THREE: INTERMEDIATE FLIGHT <br /><br />Aileron roll <br />(Note, NOT barrel roll) <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This is rarely used on its own, but it is an essential building block for more complex maneuvers and combinations. Your plane does not change altitude much in this roll, and if it does, practice until it does not. <br /><br />To Perform: Raise the nose a very small bit, and apply full ailerons in the desired direction of your roll. Compensate for any drift up or down by using your elevators. <br /><br />Hint: Practice performing a number of consecutive aileron rolls, and then ending the roll while inverted. This is a valuable, fast, and sneaky way to become inverted(which will be a building block to some other more advanced maneuvers). <br /><br />Barrel roll <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the move everyone hears about, and nobody does right. It is a corkscrew, where your altitude will change. This is one of the most valuable maneuvers, because it seems like Battlefield 2 heat seekers dont do barrel rolls very well. This will also allow you to avoid cannon fire, and if used in conjunction with reducing throttle, you will find that the jet on your 6 oclock often is concentrating on following you with his guns instead of slowing down, and will fly right into your firing zone. <br /><br />To Perform: Raise the nose about 10-20 degrees, and then bank sharply left or right. At the same time, gently pull back on the stick to maintain the roll. Usually, the stick will be toward the lower left or lower right corner of the axis for most of this roll. <br /><br />Hint: Spicing it up with varied and random rudder movement will all but ensure that nothing hits your plane. <br /><br />Loop Over <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />All loops are essential building blocks to more advanced piloting, but it is important that you know that there are a number of kinds of loops. <br /><br />Above, you see the Loop Over, which is just a normal loop. In Battlefield 2, jets have no throttle problems in trying to get over the crest of the loop like the did in 1942. Nonetheless, it is worth practicing this seemingly simple maneuver. <br /><br />While practicing it, make sure you can loop and end up heading in exactly the same direction you started. This will help you tremendously when youre working on attacking ground targets, and start learning how to loop bomb/strafe. Use your artificial horizon to monitor your roll through the loop to ensure you stay straight and end up heading in the same direction you started in. <br /><br />To Perform: Throttle up, pull back on the stick. Dont crash you noob. <br /><br />Loop Under <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />On the loop under, you need enough altitude to pull it off. Otherwise, it is relatively self explanatory where your plane will wind up. The only variable would be how many pieces it is in when it gets there. <br /><br />Again, as with the loop over, the thing to practice on this is ending up flying in the same exact direction you started. <br /><br />To Perform <br />Perform a half aileron roll, coming out inverted. Pull back on the stick, gaining airspeed and losing altitude. Keep your throttle up for the entire loop. Once you reach your inverted position again, perform another half aileron roll to right yourself <br /><br />Use your artificial horizon to monitor your roll through the loop to ensure you stay straight and end up heading in the same direction you started in. <br /><br />You now have a list of the basic and intermediate skills you should practice if youre striving to stop getting wtfpwnd every time you get in a jet. Now, lets get to some of the maneuvers that separate the nublets from the sky jockys.<br /><br />cybogirl<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You would be surprised how many different ways there are to glitch, usually ending up in a building where you can kill and others cant.<br /><br />They should just permenant claymore the inside of the buildings, then anymore glitches would be sorted out ;-).<br /><br />Maybe that would have too much of a system impact.<br /><br />Something needs to be done, as I was on Warlord (SF MAP, lovely with sniper) and people were complaining about palace wall glitching just this week.<br /><br />People actively look for these things !

It seems like they may have &quot;Road to Jalalabad&quot; map back on. it feels wonderfull to kill 2 or 3 xcu players once in a row! Believe me it&#039;s not easy.<br /><br />One other thing they have changed, is that it&#039;s no longer 24 player, they&#039;ve now made it 30 player but it will still take 6 players to start a game rather than the 32 player/8 player start game.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How very unlike me to double post, but before I forget (I <b>always</b> forget to post about this!) does anyone find it really funny and freaky when you get a kill and you hear a snigger/laugh ? I think it tends to happen only/more as sniper. I think it might be triggered when its a long shot (distance) and its a one-shot-kill. Either way, first few times it made me look outside of the game to see where it came from (I thought maybe someone had laughed in the real world !).<br /><br />Its happened only about 8-12 times to me, and now I really enjoy it. It sounds really real, a laugh, but somewhat triumphant that he got the kill.<br /><br />Anyone else ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sweet. Thanks for answering. I figured once you told us that you had screenies of the cheaters how it worked, but its good to know someone is keeping an eye out for people who play this game not as a fun challenge but as a way to simply beat people even though they lack skill, much like madenod lacks skill :P<br /><br />Well I still frequent your server, and it was full the other day and had to wait to get in, which is a good sign, its getting busy ! I like the map choices in that they are different, and if I wasn&#039;t so useless at map names I could ask you about some of the original maps that I dont see so much of now. <br /><br /><br /></div>

Esspecially with the PKM as it doesn&#039;t have any other functions like burst or single shot modes, so you end up getting the first bullet to hit and the rest of them miss. <br /><br />Even if you fire by tapping the mouse one by one won&#039;t help for long range as it&#039;s siply a full auto gun and and you will always get the extra bullet pop out and hit your team mates for no reason. And this is also from a long range point of view. :(<br /><br />Me and erjin had some fantastic games yesterday and ts 2 really made it extra special so scar/cybo, come join the XCU ts and we can have a laugh and a blast. 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, it is easier with the G36E to shoot longer range with better accuracy. Its just up close Muds can blast like a spamgoat and pray, and you know what? He usually gets it right...the prayer I mean. It works for him.<br /><br />As for yesterday it was fun with TS. It makes it different in the way Scar and akricu (MIA) will know, but they actually have more then the 3 people we had on our TS.<br /><br />As for the games, it was a lot better this time, I only had one game I was upset with, the rest were &quot;back to normal&quot; (more kills then deaths, lots of points, yummy).<br /><br />Its nice to play with people you know, which is why we play together, scar, cybo, muds, rewired and me. Getting to know these lot is fun cos once we get to know them it should make it even better.<br /><br />I will certainly try to play there more whenever I get online, which unfortunately isnt often enough.<br /><br />Might be on sporadically over the week.<br /><br />Oh, and TS cant always be done cos my &#039;puter is in me bedroom and when someones sleeping I cant be talking, or I get a talking to!&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy, old news? Hell it took 2 years plus to get my Expert Sniper badge. I&#039;m happy with that seeing as how I mainly played Sniper the whole time. It wasen&#039;t an easy one to get. Try getting 35+ kills with a sniper rifle in a single game without using claymores,nades or pistol...the legit(not stat padding)way and see. And yes it takes a while to advance from Master Sgt. I believe it&#039;s 30,000 or 50,000 I need for this rank, and I need around 3000 more. I&#039;m in no hurry.&nbsp; ;) Actually I could pull an all nighter and get next rank,but I&#039;ve put it on hold waiting for some new parts(sound card and headset).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will more then likely hit at least one rank more, and depending on what happens after that I may be lucky enough to get further ranks. Its fun trying to get 38+ sniper kills and whatnot, but the most fun is being in a group of people you know and can talk to and trying to kill the crap out of each other.<br /><br />Its a lot more of a social thing then you are experiencing at the moment spizman. Also, a lot more social then scar is experiencing as well, as he isnt on TSpeak YET!<br /><br />It is a good game either way and most important is to enjoy it.<br /><br />Scar, I missed you yesterday, so maybe tonight ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">kaleem is a nob :P<br /><br />This kid is why God gave humans the backhand. You simply approach from behind, raise you hand up across your body inpreperation, then nice and politely you call out his name..&quot;Hans&quot;.. you say. As he turns around you unleash a backhand slap so hard you think you might have broken a few bones/knuckles, but you know itll hurt himmore then itll hurt you.<br /><br />Suddenly he is cured, he no longer shouts and screams, as he is now more worried about not dying like a stupid little pile of vile crap he is.<br /><br />Repeat until he is either cured, dead or your hand snaps off.<br /><br />@Spizgirl<br />I had some nob do that to me as well, the most angry I have ever got playing online was when some shite wanted to play alone in the heli and I wouldnt get out, why should I ? He took me tothe edge of the map and killed me. I tried to have him kicked but it didnt work.<br /><br />What a w*nk*r. His name still haunts me to this day. King&lt;something&gt;999.</div>

It was ok with slight cut-out every half second, need to figure that out, perhaps turn down the quality (helps with bandwidth, something I have done myself).<br /><br />Now we need cybokid to join us and we would be completely assimilated by XCU.<br /><br />In other major news, I have now become a Seargent Major ! A true SM ! Lets hear it for me ! Hipp hipp... horay!<br /><br />Ok, enough happiness. I now have all the guns unlocked, so might play as engineer as that was the kit that I never upgraded ever.<br /><br />And finally I believe Madenod has some news he wants to break here as well...Muds ? </div>

And it was!<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t beleive it, I was watching the clan battle from outside in the lobby each time it refreshes, and then hear that XCU had won both rounds,soon after I join up officially with XCU, has made it a truly fantastic night. Just want to say thankyou to spicy again for helping me with the urge to get the legit copy by getting me frustrated, lol I&#039;m joking with the frustration bit. <br />Thankyou to scarman and cybodude for adding to XCU on everyones behalf.<br /><br />And MOST OF ALL, thankyou to Erjin999 who has and still is contributing to having fun in the XCU ts. Oh and helping me out loads.<br /><br />THANKYOUUUU!!! :D :D :D ;D ;D ;D 8)</div>

They have an advantage with the AK 101 and the rpk 74. We only got to play 1 round due to a c4 issue but, I can&#039;t wait to get another run in a clan freindly.<br /><br />Plz ppl come and join in on ts 2 coz of it&#039;s awsomism! 8)<br /><br />@ cybo.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Reason is the game is unbalanced in favour of vehicles when playing with vehicles. Many more people play with Anti-tank, which isnt really a bad thing as without vehicles hardly anyone plays it. The thing is, infantry-vs-infantry battle is just a lot more fun, a bunch of guys shooting at each other, not worrying about a huge tank coming around a corner, and most of all, about arty giving you a slight migrane as you move around.<br /><br />Its quite subtly different in that (myself at least) you might not realise when you start prefering IO (Infantry Only) play.<br /><br />Try Karkand, one of the best maps, and try IO...Most people stick to city maps as well, as it best suits IO.</div>

Therer are also voice chat, and a bunch of other stuff.<br />check it out.<br />www.xfire.com<br />add us ,I think me,scar ,maddie,erjiin rewire are using the forun name as nick any other welcome to add their nicks.<br /><br />cybo</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Currently the biggest feature is that I can hunt down scar/mud/cybogirl....anyone, simply by checking which server xfire says they are playing on. Without that I would rely on, say, scar having msn open and an automesage saying where he was or something equally silly.<br /><br />Its great, and allows good in game chat text chat between xfire friends.<br /><br />A good download and install to have.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My K:D ratio got a little hit yesterday... I could barely keep up with my deaths as infantry most of the time, and often having more deaths than kills. After trying lots of different kits, I think I&#039;m settling for medic. They do OK with guns, and I need the extra healing points to rise from my somewhat permanent position in the middle of the score board. (As I&#039;m used to driving armored vehicles and only run around as infantry between vehicles, it&#039;s a very big change to only play infantry.)<br /><br />Also, fore some reason, I was always on the losing team. I think my team won one out of 10-15 rounds. I guess people like me were guilty of the team&#039;s statistics...&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Anyway, thanks a lot for the warm welcome. I tried TS2 yesterday, but people were asleep next door to my room, and I was unable to do more than greet you guys. That will be a returning problem I&#039;m afraid. I&#039;ll see what I can do about it.<br /><br />Also, please note that this is post number <b>1337</b> in this thread! I&#039;m so leet.</div>

I&#039;m not sure if you fully recognise cybopatche as they hav&#039;nt mention you much. So keep coming on XCU and have FUUUUN!<br /><br />Yesterday there was another hack involving supply crates. I saw it for my self at the train crash while I was running to the end of the bridge during heavy nade bombardment, I saw to my shock that there were 6-7 crates in the space of 20 seconds. To add up, XCU were powerless to do anything about it.<br /><br />If only I had a screenie. ::)<br /><br />Oooyeeea!

We don&#039;t blag about which team we beat at all we just see it as a normal game but an organised team game and we still have a laugh through the match but only these times during clan matches/freindlies we have more comms and concentration.<br /><br />I think I made a mistake in the amount of players that you guys have. Acriku hasn&#039;t play for a long while has he? and niether has Rewired. If they come on then you have the team if not then just a matter of persuading gunwounds that there is a clan freindly that he may be interested in, if and when XCU go ahead with it. 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes it is! You are absolutely right but the ammo clip is low so not much use for anyone in which case, seen as this is clan war talk, there is no unlocks so sadly no g3&#039;s spicy.<br /><br />Is sunday a good day for you all to make? 7.00 0.clock English time. Is there anyway one of you guys can run your own ts 2 or I can ask boon or vards if they can have a seperate section in there ts 2 for you guys.and maybe erjin can be you leader/admin then that that way he can give you all the password to the xcu server and the quick recap on the rules before the clan freindly starts. 8)<br /><br /></div>

That way we have 15 Min&#039;s for everyone to arrive (any latecomers) and also a chance to talk tactics, because one thing you don&#039;t do is just play normal style. Also, initially I want everyones Xfire on, then we can disable it once everyone is in TS...I will need to give out IPs and possibly passwords.<br /><br />Squads are the ONLY was to move around the map in these types of games. No more lone wolf trying to take on 5 members of xcu nonsense. Its now about huddling up close (of course, if by the end of it we lose cos we kept getting noob toob&#039;d [Grenade Launcher] then I will edit this post :P).<br /><br />We can discuss the details on TS as I happen to <b>KNOW</b> spies are watching our every post.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Medics are good. I like medics. In fact, my favourite kit at the mo is medic kit...<br /><br />And running around - its not a <i>bad</i> tactic, per se...just not really the best..maybe...<br /><br />Yeah, we can chat for 5 - 10 mins soon enough.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">the use of medics can and will win the game for u ie more people u revive less tickets u loose and all end results are how many tickets u lost or won by so having a bunch of half decent medics is a definate boon when playin friendlies and more importantly for =XCU= wars this is just a little bit of advice from experiance but i look foward to seeing what tactics u come up with</div>

Look at it this way, Alot of clans out there don&#039;t like matches being postponed or forfieted because people that are expected can&#039;t make it. If this happens then you are bound to get spoken about (as a group)in a bad way. What ever I am saying is an example so try to learn from it. You all said you will be there and you didn&#039;t but credit to you all who did. :o &gt;:(<br /><br />I know this is a very small group but be honest with yourselves! Do you really want in for the sake of unity within FD2K + fun? just say it straight up &quot;yes&quot;(I will definetly be in) or &quot;NO&quot;(sorry can&#039;t make this one.) Or pm erjin 2 hours latest before the match starts. ::)</div>

I remember in the first I racked up 73 points, 6 higher then the nearest XCU ;). But in the second, I don&#039;t even know what happened, my score mostly stayed constant because of TKs, but all I really remember was driving around in a jeep doing nothing because all the enemy team was doing was flying around and not attacking.<br /><br />The only bad thing was that everyone on teamspeak was British! It would be appreciated if XCU would correct this oversight at the nearest opportunity, as I had no idea who was talking at any given time, let alone what they were talking about.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am using the antitank with P90 (or whatever its called, good range on that, shame its like spraying them with water&nbsp; ???) and the carbines of the spec ops kit more then before. Natural reaction to needing to take out APCs and Tanks.<br /><br />When the going gets tough on the ground I ditch the G36E of the medic and go for a G3 from the assault kit. I cant get the hang of the noobus toobus though. That does take some getting used to.<br /><br />My K/D is still stuck at 0.99, I will fix that tonight hopefully.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, news news news.<br /><br />Mr Madenod has had an emergency operation, not like, Special Forces operation, no...more like battlefield wound, with surgeons and phrases like &quot;pass me the scalpel&quot;.<br /><br />I will let him fill you guys in on the specifics when he is back from the field hospital.<br /><br />Myself, I have been just too busy/tired to play lately. I have been offline about a week maybe. When I get a few minutes I just play on my new Wii (yeah, new for me, I finally found one ! Big shortages in the UK).</div>

I&#039;m not going into details about it but trust me I KNOW what it&#039;s like lets just say 20 odd yrs. of smoking took it&#039;s toll. For Christ sake I have to take 100 mcg.of Fentynal patches every 3 days for my pain which i&#039;d rather not get into. My point is I guess is gaming keeps the mind sharp, for me anyway so does playing guitar. If you let it kill your spirit, then your already dead. Blunt, but it&#039;s the truth man.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Madenod. I am still soldiering on, now my K/D ratio is around 1.02 and climbing.<br /><br />I have recently changed my mouse surface (I play on an old cupboard shelf placed on my desk, which allows me to extend my keyboard out more comfortably for me) and have swapped sides on it. I think this has meant my optical mouse is slightly more accurate now. Or perhaps I am now getting more used to placing the cross hairs more accurately quicker.<br /><br />Either way, I find I am now kicking butt more. I think playing with XCU has honed my skills now beyond what they were before. Still more to go, a lot of room for improvement, but a good place to be right now :P.<br /><br />I also find that I can predict movement of the enemy on the map better and can sort of expect where people will be. I am killing people without them seeing me more and more, coming from funny angles and stuff. The kind of thing that used to happen to me not too long ago.<br /><br />I still get screwed by lots of people, its just nice to screw others in return :8.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is that I am the ONLY darn =FD2K= tagged player on XCU !! Come on guys, I know Muds has been assimilated, but we should be able to pull together a squad of sorts. Rewired, where have you gone ? SPicy, I realise you cannot join us, and that is a shame. Scar, hope things are good at home, havent seen you on for a bit. Cybo the music man, jive on over to Karkand...Acriku, God knows he is MIA. I never ever saw Gunwounds on BF2. Cybo has been on but not of late, fine, he says he is working hard so I expect he will play hard int he summer, right?</div>

If you don&#039;t stick with your squad and back each other up then you end up getting a high death rate with noone to save you tickets on your team. <br /><br />Can anyone of you go solo and then take on 4-6 people in a squad? I rest my case, lol.<br /><br />Even without voice comms it&#039;s best stick to a squad for survival purposes.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;sry madenod i don&#039;t agree with you about the MK3A1 having upper hand on g3...<br />&nbsp;because its 2 diffrent weapons here..<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;we are saying g3 is best assult rifle but we didn&#039;t say its better than the pkm for<br />&nbsp;example because pkm is a support heavy machine gun rifle..<br /><br />&nbsp;so as you see the MK3A1 may own g3 in short range attacks if the player didn&#039;t prone<br />&nbsp;but believe me if i was standing at the end of the street i will give you 5 free shots<br />&nbsp;of MK3A1 and u wont hit me and i will reply to ure fire and kill you in one shot..<br /><br />&nbsp;now if u want to compare between weapon classes&nbsp; (assult,support,sniper, ex) to see<br />which is better i don&#039;t think i have an openion on that because i think it depend<br />on which class u are good at.. i am assault player </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Who said anything about long range with a MK3A1? Lol.<br />It will still rape any weapon from close range far more efficiently then a DOA 12 to. It will guarentee rape all assult weapons from close up.(noobtubes excluded but I may kill them before they fire one if I&#039;m lucky) :P<br /><br />G3 is ponce if you were to use it against me. Ask erjin how many times people jokingly complain how many times they keep dieing from the awsome auto shotgun and now they recogise the noise everytime that if I&#039;m still alive It&#039;s easy to know who I am (Ahh it&#039;s Madenod... that basket of a shotgunner, lets kill him.<br /><br />I could even rape people with G36E&#039;s and G36c&#039;s one after the other and all would be head on duals.<br />I could kill far more close range than long range coz I love to get stuck in the IO fire fights.<br /><br />Erm, G3 one shot kill from long range? But a sniper can&#039;t kill with one shot unless it were a headshot, but a G3? <br /><br />I get so peeved off with people who don&#039;t move across the bridge between the train crash and gate house in Karkand, come on people I NEED BACKUP! hahaaaa. ::) 8)<br /><br />Shoot well</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think he means one burst, which is effectively one shot (but not the same, whateverrrrr)...<br /><br />One burst could be more then one bullet. Like one shot killls with my G36E, which is on 3 shot burst.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;d like to add that anyone of you who uses a support class should take advantage of the triple burst mode of the MG36 because it is equal to the G36E but the gap between each burst is slow but it is still as accurate as the G36E in long range. Porblem with the MG36 is it&#039;s to much a delicate machine gun as people get used to the slowness of the PKM and this puts them off using the burst mode at all.<br /><br />If it&#039;s made for burst mode then it must be what it does otherwise it&#039;s just a plain ordinary machine gun with nothing going for it. When it says it has high strength polimers when needed it means it strengthens the front muzzle to make 3 bullets pop out in streight. The recoil is far less in this mode and it&#039;s more accurate to kill from this mode rather than doing tap tap for one shots. I&#039;ve been trying this for a while and feel that now I can finally kill alot more in long range now.<br />Now here&#039;s a problem that support people need to overcome,remebering to switch back to full auto and vice versa.<br /><br />Anyhow, if anyone can get good at this then they are on a roll of alot of kills. 8)<br /><br />P.S.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="http://forum.dune2k.com/index.php?topic=18211.msg318318#msg318318">Quote from: sp1cy on June 13, 2007, 10:49:19</a></div><div class="quote">mad i would never allow peapol to get so near to me ,well in most cases..<br />&nbsp;</div><br />Yea I wouldn&#039;t allow it either but it happens and when it does...BOOM BOOM BOOM 3 shotgun burst will do the job.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Scarmans right about pistols coz he&#039;s implying that these are used for long range/defence, Also if you run out of ammo. In which case if you have a MK3A1 then it&#039;s pistol all the way till you feel the enemy is close. You can fire far with a DOA-12 but definetly not with a MK3A1. I could&#039;nt swap a shotgun for the engineers MP7 coz of it&#039;s humungous recoil, it may be the smallest/lightest sub machine gun but the rate of fire causes it to lift upwards in 1 second so best to always go prone and shoot at the groin and let it rake upwards to the head. If the enemy is crouching then best shoot at the feat.<br /><br />Do any of you have expert knife bagde? :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Depends on the tool. Simple print screen button click with no app/tool installed can only handle 1 pic at a time, and new one overwrites the old. It copies it to the clipboard, for you paste into anything you want (word, mspaint, photoshop...whatever you want) where proper tools can get many pictures and store then in your chosen location (they may have a default one) when you press the print screen button (you can usually change they key too).<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looking in my manual now...It just says to use print screen. Why is that so hard? Print-screen then go to you BF2 folders of screen shot. I mean F12 and print-screen are right next to each other.&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Then if it is print screen by defualt it will go to your clipboard (memory) and from there you can normally paste it to any program that can handle pics (word, mspaint, not notepad...etc...).<br /><br />Try it, it it does paste to word or something then you can only store one pic at a time, which is crap. If that is the case, upgrade to some other program. I would still recommend howies screen capture (google if you want it).<br /><br />Scar ? You still not online ?</div>

I often wait for space on my servers, even though I can ask them to kick, I dont think that is a good idea, I just wait for up to 15 mins (record so far!).<br /><br />Get xfire or teamspeak or something, I wanna play with you!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man....EA has got to be getting some really mega hate emails due to the no stats by the ton&#039;s, I swear to God, if they don&#039;t get it up soon I will never ever buy another EA game no matter how great it is. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s not a ploy to get you to buy 2142. I hear their stats are up and doing just fine. I just find it hard to believe that EA doesn&#039;t have the bandwidth to support stats, if that is the case here. Morons.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the way I understand it...<br /><br />DICE made BF2. EA sell it. EA thought of ways to screw customers (as they seem to do with every game they release). They decided to get gamespy to host the stats servers (everyone knows how stats heavy BF2 is). They must&#039;ve thought the bugs were bad enough, and if not, something bad will turn up, it always does.<br /><br />Well, no gamespy don&#039;t seem to be accepting stats. Some have said it is probably because ea don&#039;t want to pay them. EA are farts.<br /><br />BF2412 works ok on stats because I have heard that they are themselves hosting the stats servers.<br /><br />People are becoming paranoid that they will lose their stats. I dont think that will happen. I think that if anything they will never be updated (damn !!) which is bad enough. Obvioisly the stats servers are &quot;up&quot; as I can retrieve my stats, I get my unlocks etc...etc... Just new stats are ebing rejected. I hope they are being kept aside and will be added later. I doubt it though, I think we will just lose stats for the outage period.<br /><br />Question is...how long will the outage period be ? Forever ? &gt;:D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This was my reply from EA about the stats being down via email:<br /><br />&quot;EA Customer Support is currently aware of a stat outage which is affecting several players. We are working extremely hard to pinpoint the cause of the issue and correct it. EA|Dice, EA Customer Support and all the Battlefield Partners are dedicated to making sure that your game play experience remains exciting and that your hard work is recorded while playing Battlefield.<br /><br />While every effort will be made to include stats gained during the outage, there is a possibility that those earned during this brief period will not be reflected in your final stats total. We appreciate your patience and understanding, and apologize for the inconvenience.<br /><br />Update: As of 6-22-07 we are still working on this issue and appreciate your continued patience. We will update this FAQ again as soon as we have additional information.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If you wish to receive a notification of any changes or updates on this issue please click the Notify me.. button at the bottom of this page.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I like how they said,&quot;several players&quot; in the first sentence, haha more like several thousand. ass-tards. I would be willing to bet if something like this happened to World of Warcraft there would be mass suicide.&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />@Spicy, I tried yesterday to join that server after turning off all my filters and using your IP address for that one you play on but it didn&#039;t connect.

Unless you have a screenshot of what all other players are seeing,then it&#039;s very likely there are cheaters among them. You would be amazed at how many cheats are out there.<br />This is from XCU server take a gander at some of the cheats out there and how many are just in this 1 server alone that they find(thank god). Kudos and then some to the one that catches them. http://xcuclan.co.uk/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=29 The good thing is they get busted and never return. All those posted there are just on a single server out of tons of others, makes ya think eh? This is why I love XCU clan, because if you even attempt a cheat/hack your ass is banned forever.<br /><br /><br />Ok, I&#039;m on the server right now theres only 1 other guy in the game.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy, it was good to play with you. I was going to use xfire to find out the server IP for antik, that&#039;s why it took me so long to join, becuase you closed xfire while playing, when I said &quot;ok, Ill join you&quot; (probably for cpu usage reasons). I had to google antik, and wasn&#039;t sure I had the right one, as I think there is more then 1 antik server.<br /><br />Anyway, I found you and joined and played. First off, I lagged quite badly at some points, often enough. I dont think it was my ping at all, it was probably my graphics. I will definitely turn them down a bit and play with you again.<br /><br />You must&#039;ve noticed quite a few times I jumped out of the driving seat and let you drive as I don&#039;t know my way around the map well at all, only played it a few times (10-20) loooong time ago.<br /><br />The players were normal/average. The pilots were good, but there are just as good on the ranked servers. The last time you killed me in the helicopter I was looking on the team list to see where you were, I couldn&#039;t see you (now I know it was because you were shooting at the chopper I was a passenger in! :)).<br /><br />I was not sure you could hear me on Comms, I thought you must have it off, as you made no reply, not even in text. It did feel weird playing in a vehicle server on that map, because I tend to stick to city maps even with/without vehicles.<br /><br />Overall - good fun and would love to play with you again (on BF2 !! naughty people !).<br /><br />Keep xfire running in the background, its not too bad and then we know when you are on and can join you.<br /><br />Also, yes, I can see your pages in game, but was probably away from keyboard a the time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;that was cobra dam a slow map in term of scoring. the round was 6 min from end<br />&nbsp;and honestly i am playing today from 10am and now its 8 pm and i don&#039;t remember what happend at the end of that round but until that time<br />&nbsp;i had the upper hand on both teams.. and that was an aa vehicle not a tank..<br />&nbsp;i never usually come first in this server not in score or in killes<br />&nbsp;u saw haw some of them are...<br />&nbsp;but i have my place in top 10 most of the time and i am surly in control of my game <br />&nbsp;and my killes and that is giving me more pleasure in playing..<br /><br />&nbsp;the biggest improvement in my skills which i am most satisfied with as an assault player<br />&nbsp;is the 1vs1 shooting were i have become a player who is very hard to kill.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I find medic easier to play with and last long with as I can heal myself. So if I go 1vs1 or 1vs2 or whatever I can heal myself after if I get any damage, which increases my chances of survival. I know of people who run around with assault or whatever and just kill people one after another with no need of medic, as they are so quick.<br /><br />I cant rely on that so medic it is for me, but I do play other kits pretty equally.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;am not slow but am not so quick either .. that&#039;s why i use the most powerful weapon which<br />&nbsp;is the assult, the medic weapon is so weak ..<br />&nbsp;and i think in 1vs1 there is no need to heal your self because its either you kill or die<br />&nbsp;and if you kill you can easly pull back few steps and grab a medic bag from off the ground.<br />&nbsp;but the good thing about medic is that is the best kit to score from healing and reviving<br />&nbsp;no other kit can beat that</div>

Because when I first got the game, there were times many times that I just played so late at night I just left it on and went to bed not even realizing the hours were being counted. That&#039;s when all I did was lone-wolf as sniper just sitting in one spot for hours and didn&#039;t know shit about squads. I think after a year of having the game I got really serious at playing it the right way. Squads etc. teamwork. But yes Erjin is very good.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Congratulations scar! Spicy, he is talking about joining the clan =XCU=, with Madenod has joined and so have I.<br /><br />Its nice and fun.<br /><br />I still want to play again with you spicy, just to see what you mean about those guns, and maybe show you how good the 3 burst medic unlock is (I am trying not to use it because it is making it hard for me to use other kits, I get used to it too much. In clan battles unlocks are not allowed generally, so I need to practice with other guns!!).<br /><br />The G3 is the gun I get out when I get angry. It has extreme power, takes out fools (when I am angry they are &quot;fools&quot; and not fellow game players :P) in a efw shots, if that. It is reasonably accurate, and when I am angry I dont mind it running out of bullets, as it usually means I have killed 2 people with the round.<br /><br />Having said that, it DOES have a small round, another 5 bullets would have been excellent, but probably overpowerful too, so I think it works ok.<br /><br />I dont use it for general fighting though, I like to kill 3 or more people quickly and I dont think it is good for that. Maybe if I use single shot...<br /><br />Scar, I havent gone back yet, maybe when we hit page 100 I might !&nbsp; ;) ;)<br /><br />I do worry about my stats, I want them to be good, its another side of the game for me, its about killing, not being killed, and then seeing how you compare to those around you. I am trying to get my K/D to 1.5 and get my Score Per Minute/SPM up to as close to 3 as possible.<br /><br />At my current rate I am probably achieving that, but I need to make up for the times when I was a complete beginner and lost big time.<br /><br />Generally I tend to score in the top half of the scoreboard, and often get medals (gold , silvers and bronze). I like medals :P</div>

Maybe I can find my original by some miracle!<br /></div><br />Thatll teach you to go awol, soldier !&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Now get your flab back on the battlefield !</div>

Hosting of pics is done at Imageshack.us ...<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;(http://img358.imageshack.us/img358/2273/bf220070704222730rd0.th.png) (http://img358.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bf220070704222730rd0.png)<br />A pic of me where I kicked a little XCU butt. Boon is one of the best XCU players, in my opinion so everytime I kill him its a bonus. Greenaway is like a rival and I see him as an equal, so its nice when I kill him, not so nice when he gets me by noob toob from miles away.<br /><br />(http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/2269/bf220070704223539qo1.th.png) (http://img181.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bf220070704223539qo1.png)<br />This one is even better for me, Righthandofdeath is one of the most lethal players in XCU, so I must&#039;ve got lucky in killing him, then somehow cityslick (hard to get close to) ate some of my lead, and then good old greenaway again, poor greeny &gt;:D<br /><br />(http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/7553/bf220070703233903kr4.th.png) (http://img507.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bf220070703233903kr4.png)<br /><br />Here I have killed someone, shockpaddled someone else and then rivived my ally who got killed somehow in the beginning (he is the one who got my attention to the enemies).<br /><br />Thats some serious Score Per Minute there ! :P<br /><br />All screen shots have been resized into 640 x 480, trust me, I dont play at that resolution!

You&#039;ll find yourself out of ammo after 2 kills coz it&#039;s got 2 ammo clips only and thats real bad for IO maps.<br />Personally this gun would be best if your in vehicle servers coz there wouldn&#039;t be much use for this weapen. ;D :) 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been a little busy since that match, but damn it was awesome. Talk about intense, I was nervous as shit, cause I knew they were keeping an eye on what I did right or wrong. But I loved the Mashtuur rounds alot. Honestly never played serious on a 16 pyr. map ever..so that was a first for me. Ton&#039;s o Fun!!<br /><br /><br />Edit...Just found this screeny of a round of one of those games.<br /><br />(http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/5471/screen004ko9.th.png) (http://img65.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screen004ko9.png)<br /><br />&nbsp;I have no clue why I took it, but you can see by the score what&#039;s about to happen. :&#039;( But you can also see by the killing discripts... (top left) how intense and steady the killing rate was going at. I really liked that squad we had going there alot...Japeye did a great job as squad leader.Also,using that kit without unlocks, that gun pwns. I had a few sniper distance kills with it at the Mosque. popping and using it on semi-auto from across the bridge. For matches with no unlocks that kit rules.&nbsp; 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;Yea, my last try at that server, it was something like 90% splash damage killing(hele/gunner flag guarding), and 10% chance of actually spawning for more than a few seconds and living long enough to move. Now does the one patch apply to that server were the hele gun was nerfed at on time or not? If not then it makes perfect sense. That&#039;s really the only difference to me between inf. only play and vehicles allowed. It really is nothing more than killing and playing with only your skill and foot and sprint traveling (inf.only), and having the ability to use vehicles for travel and alot of splash damage kill&#039;s. I don&#039;t mind playing either or, just my opinion.&nbsp; ;)</div>

That wasen&#039;t the problem I had with that server,it was the baseraping and spawn-killing that pissed me off, plain and simple.<br /><br />The good thing about playing with the official rankings and such is, when such a thing starts happening I can move to a different server and don&#039;t have to deal with it. Instead of being stuck only in one server.&nbsp; ;) We do play in other games and servers with all units all the time. That&#039;s just how the Clan battles and other matches are geared. And anyone who has played in or with XCU cannot say it didn&#039;t sharpen their skill&#039;s, even if it was a few games. Hell, to even play against all of the other clanmates you have no choice but to get sharper skills...or you are usually dead pretty quick.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Spicy, in that game, in part, I deliverately spawned on the one flag we had on the land (we started off as USMC on the carrier) as I dont give a monkeys left b*all as to what my stats are on those servers. I noticed you hung back on the carrier rather then spawn on that one flag and used air vehicles to play. Had I given a damn about my stats I would be a lot more picky about how I played.<br /><br />Spicy, dont be under the impression that we only play inf only or that we are no good at vehicles, its just more fun with inf only. I guess you cant know that as you havent tried inf only. We have tried both and as you have seen, still play both to this day, its just more fun on inf only.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;playing inf only makes you weak when you playe the real bf2 game against trained pilots<br />&nbsp;and armored juggernaut ,,, u will panic every time u hear the jet passing by..<br />&nbsp;i think skill comes with practice and if you don&#039;t learn haw to shoot helies with the hammer canon<br />&nbsp;and aa rockets its normal that you will get smacked ..<br />&nbsp;because all you know is haw to deal with inf by shooting them all the time and the inf never<br />&nbsp;do as much damage&nbsp; as trained pilots and good armor unites..<br />&nbsp;now if you playe on inf servers all the time you wont have the sense<br />&nbsp;of danger that keeps you from getting hit all the time, the player who playes <br />&nbsp;on normal servers is in more danger than you. and is more skilled in the game than<br />&nbsp;you.and have more aggression than you. yes you get&nbsp; better skilles in inf war but on the account of losing other skilles<br />such as hiding and surface to air attacks,<br />&nbsp; that&#039;s means inf players=lamers . because they will get pounded at the real servers and will<br />never be good pilots or armor units<br />&nbsp;as for spawn killing its Oslo your fault because you are used to playe on lam servers..<br />&nbsp;if you are capturing a flag then its normal to kill the spawners because if you don&#039;t they will<br />&nbsp;kill you because they are meters awy from the flag and on 64/64 servers you wont believe<br />&nbsp;have fast the&nbsp; waves of attackers are , on maps like sharki or road to jalal. man they are not spawn killers they are just moving lines after lines so its normal that u get killed<br />and here you have 2 choices : 1_ spawn at base and find a transport (that what i do)<br />2_ get into a squad and then you spawn at the flag.<br />_about base rape we have scripts against base rapers and the ban list is full of them but<br />new players are allways coming in at antik and they don&#039;t usually read the rules <br />and they get kicked all the time because when you do that the server will give you <br />warnings in green text calling you by name then it will kick and ban you,<br />antik is not the best server when it comes to rules but its normal to have issues like this<br />in a 64/64 players server that is full all the time..<br />about you having the choice of diffrent servers i never said that getting the copy of the game<br />is better than the cool ea ranking but it was all the choices i had.. but at the end i got used to the <br />players at antik they are much similar to the dune2k community were you get known by others<br />and have a chance to make nice Friends. so its not a total loss..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

I will still be spec-ops until it does get recorded and that will mean more deaths in the struggle for this veteran badge.<br /><br />Now from my exp of the weapons for spec-ops. The G36C is so accurate you can lie on the floor and kill someone in full auto in medium or and in some cases long(provided you can shoot a moving target smoothly &gt;:( ;D)<br /><br />Scar-L has almost no recoil when standing so you can walk sideways and shoot someone who is lying down or shoot someone from medium by standing.<br /><br />My choice of gun is the Scar-L as it has the laser dot and you can shoot someone accurately while standing up. I have tested the cross hair pattern from standing,crouching and going prone and it all is the same pattern for Scar-L in any position. 8)</div>

Takes about 3 to 5 shots to the body(depending on what kit they are) and 2 to the face for kill,but like Mad said hardly no recoil at all. What I wish EA would do is make the ones in SF unlocks because it is the heavy version Scar-L.Reg BF2 has only the light version. Aim for the face on semi an that thing rocks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got an unlock when I got that promo. every promo I&#039;ve gotten an unlock so yea. And I still say the M95 rules all, just look at the damage it causes even higher than the next unlock does. 2 hit kill or 1 headshot which I try for always.<br /><br />I kind of quit sniping after I got the expert badge. But I will do it like say at the train wreck on Karkand.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah that bridge crossing is a sniper heaven hehe. I like the M95 when I&#039;m anything but Marines, but I find myself missing more often than with the Marine default rifle. Don&#039;t know why? <br /><br />My favorite kills as a sniper is when they stop the vehicle ahead of me and switch to the turret. It&#039;s so easy to pick them off.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I love sniping them while they are running not towards me but side to side headshot. about that last unlock sniper rifle, The only thing good about it is it has super fine crosshairs, but less damage per hit. I hardly ever use that thing and if I do I die fast. I&#039;m using the Scar-L alot now and support, medic. Oh yea and that new unlock I got for the engie, in close quarters it&#039;s basically a damn uzi, I love it.<br />Another tip, if you want to get fast points play commander alot. take a look at my new best score now all from commanding, not to mention 5 more gold stars. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">at the ingame menus you can choose ure default army and kit at the bfhq tab so that you start<br />&nbsp;the game automatically with it, just like you do at emp when u preset house and sub house<br />&nbsp;at the multilayer options so that u have them automatically when you join a room.<br /><br />&nbsp;am i right?<br /><br />&nbsp;if so my army at bfhq keeps returning to usa army so i always end up with USA team<br />&nbsp;which i allready have the medal of it</div>

By the time your scar-l&#039;s finish shooting me two pops from my baby and you would already be dead.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Xfire&nbsp; ;) tells me your on what ip and game your in etc. The one I jumped in on was on Mashtuur 64 plyr. and yes it was crazy. I was on your side but no squad. But i&#039;m telling ya man, TS not the in game VOIP&nbsp; rules and makes the game 100x better. Nothing beats hearing someone lose their cool in game...i&#039;m guilty of that sometimes as well. Xfire I only use really to find someone, or get an IP for a game they are in. And the reason for that is, when I stop to chat in game, 99% of the time I will die. So chatting is a no-can-do for me. The prob with pub. servers and the in game VOIP is you tend to get these ass-hats that talk about their girl friends, and smoking doobies and they are usually your squad leader or commander. So I stopped using that alltogether...TS all the way man.</div>

Now I can use both in game chat and TS, and its a mix of both that works best.<br /><br />In game chat when you want to tell boon that he is being followed, or where to go, and TS to gloat that you just killed madenod!</div>

Well, we dont die, we kill. So you get every kill if you are alone, and only some kills if you are in a squad).<br /><br />You can still medicate if you are in a squad. By being in a squad, I mean actually stick with them, not just have players with green name tags on opposite ends of the map!<br /><br />So I usually only score high when I go solo and go to the front lines like Rambo with some bandages in my backpack ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Its basically a way of rubbing it in, to pistol kill someone, to shock-paddle them or to knife them is to embarrass them!<br /><br />Spicy, you tried to line up the columns but spaces dont line up well as they look different in different screen resolutions, use a character like the underscore I used to keep columns in-line.<br /><br />I have Java enabled, by the way, I just didnt look at all those medals! I am lazy!!<br /><br />Akri, I only love the G36E, not the LA81A whatever its called or the other medic gun. They dont have the accuracy of this gun, except when they are on single shot. With this gun on single shot I can snipe on snipers!! Yeah baby! and it has a decent clip on it, not a G3 shit-I-just-run-out-of-bullets-but-he-hasn&#039;t-now-I&#039;m-dead kind of thing ::).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys, sorry for going awol for so long. been out of town for a while visiting relatives and going to a Van Halen concert. Also My 7300 vid card toasted on me, I really wanted to get that 8800gtx but just couldn&#039;t afford it so I went with this one http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16814130062<br />Here&#039;s the one I had that bit the dust,compare the specs on both I think it&#039;s a nice upgrade.<br />http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141029<br /><br />It should smoke the one I had anyway,none of that turbo cashe crap. I&#039;ll get it thursday, put my good mboard back in,and WILL be playing BF2 around sunday i would guess. right now i&#039;m using my other asus<br />with intergrated graphics. I should be able to play it on high sets also by the specs of this card i&#039;m getting. So when I get back into it, be gentle cause i&#039;m rusty as all hell.&nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Holy sh*t!!&nbsp; this video card kicks all sorts of ass. For the first time ever I can play BF2 on all high setts, for hours without a hickup. I cannot get over how great it looks now, just frickin amazing. Again it&#039;s this one http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16814130062<br />&nbsp;It has 24/7 free tech support with it, even if you call them at 3 a.m. they help you. I priced it at Nvidia for around $190.00 I bought this from good ole Newegg.com for 89 with a 15 buck rebabte I will basically get a 15 dollar check in the mial from Newegg. I know the 8800 series are greater, but this damn thing is no slouch at all...I cannot stress enough how good this card is. Best bang for the buck I have ever come across yet in cards. And the way I played BF2 on all high setts was using the high quality setting not the high performance one. AL I can say is it&#039;s a steal for $89.00. take a good look at those picks of it on that link. Toms Hardware highly recommended it also. Also has SLi ready so when I get a duel card board i&#039;m gettting another one of these. Sorry if this should be in the hardware thread but I just had to tell how it played intense graghic games so damn good.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be playing online pretty damn soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s true we really can kill with a head shot on single mode. Ask anyone vards, karmas or lycan. <br /><br />One thing that really annoys me is even on single shot mode it&#039;s not accurate coz nearly the whole clip missed my target who was on a roof top. I reported this on ts and greeny agreed that it works once and then it skrews up the next time. &gt;:(</div>

( i just heard the the sultans of swing<br />&nbsp;song by Dire Straits on net radio and it made me cry .. dam amazing vocal i swear he is&nbsp; 8) )<br /><br />&nbsp; anyway&nbsp; im just lacking the purpose&nbsp; when i join the map the and i dont know anyone<br />&nbsp;and am not expecting anything new to happen . same players standing at same places <br />&nbsp;just got a little better than yesterday but i i said i dont see the point in <br />&nbsp;raising a person skill level so bad in a vedio game that will end suddenly and put 1000s of ours<br />&nbsp;of ure skill practicing in trash can.. its just kinda nerve stressing<br />&nbsp;thing and by now the bright things of the game that used to attract me when it was new<br />&nbsp;is over.. i like new things by my nature and i get board so easly i never made<br />&nbsp;success in a job or a marrige.. <br />&nbsp;man&nbsp; i just got oblivion and its really amazing&nbsp; . i like single player so much <br />&nbsp;its so relaxing and exiting and the story line show u new things and keep u busy..<br />&nbsp;i playe it all day and i look at new places and things i dont expect..<br /><br />&nbsp; madenod&nbsp; look at my status&nbsp; i played 900 hours<br />&nbsp;on antik only and i played about 500 hours more on other private&nbsp; servers<br /><br />&nbsp;thats 3 times what u played and 2 times as erjin maybe when u are near 1000 hours u may feel<br />&nbsp;things i feel .. long talk and i feel i dont know haw to explain i just lack the<br />&nbsp;happening of new things when i logon to the map and there no one or nothing to talk about<br />&nbsp;and i as i said for the skill thing i just dont see a point in getting any better..<br />&nbsp;well bf2 may not die next year but it will the one after.. even now big games are out<br />&nbsp;and the new games will win at the end , just like bf2 did to emp.. thank you .</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Even if it were a non-progressive singleplayer game, being able to play it at my own pace is relaxing. It helps take my attention off stressful issues, but yet I don&#039;t feel stressed up by the game itself. So as not to stray off-topic...<br /><br />I&#039;ve totally stopped playing Battlefield 2. Online at least. Perhaps I still play singleplayer a little, but a game with a competitive nature easily dies off me.</div>

It&#039;s nice to finally have a card that can handle full-on graphics for BF2. Makes such a difference, there are alot of small detailed things that i&#039;ve never noticed before in game. Also have been doing alot of stunt type shit for the hell of it with the friendly fire off in single plyr. Jumping in a buggy with someone else doing explosives at the right time is awesome. I wish I could record and knew how to do that so I could post some of them.</div>

Sure I had fun playing it together with friends, but the game is full of bugs and has a ridiculous point system. To get all the medals you need over 700 hours of playing, who comes up with this stuff? Cod4 does it way better, too bad my computer is too old to play that game over internet.<br /><br />Just think about all the things you can do in 570 hours...<br /><br />My stats: http://bf2s.com/player/53416052/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PFFF, I would be general in no time if I played constantly like you do on your server. Look at your medals and badges compared to mine, and I got mine while playing mainly sniper which is no easy task. At any rate, i&#039;m playing another game atm anyway, so i&#039;m not really concerned about BF2 right now. Have fun catching up to me though.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />&nbsp;And for the billionth time, your server and ours are apples and oranges in comparison. How you don&#039;t recognize that i&#039;ll never understand. Therefore you CANNOT compare the 2 by their stats. Understand?<br />because 99.9% of the people playing this game clearly understand that. Your server caters to those who for the most-part download the game and have very limited servers such as yours. I simply chose to go with the official EA Stats with a bought version and will continue to play it that way until i&#039;m done with it...Just that simple. I don&#039;t want super fast results and ranks, I want to play it the correct way...when I earn it, I&#039;ll get it.<br /><br /><br />BTW Brigadier General<br />Requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining<br />Brigadier General&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 180,000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;84%<br /><br />Not that far anyway.&nbsp; :P<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I no longer play this online, but to be frank, a server with a different rank rating allows no room for comparison. If a player could get a brigadier general rank by playing in 1 hour, does that allow the player to go about saying he&#039;s made it better in the game than anybody else who is sitting in the official servers and going about for hundreds of hours but only a gunnery sergeant? We need to get real, seriously.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No conficts coz it&#039;s the same as having with ebfd nocd patch. All you gotta do is download it and put it in the right place in the folder for that game. <br />Best bet is to e.mail erjin for it coz he did&#039;nt tell me where he got it unless you can find it. I&#039;ve been playing online with the nocd patch since I baught the game so it&#039;s fine with me.<br />Spicy you know where we can get the nocd patch from?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Eek don&#039;t do any universe but universe 40 coz it&#039;s the latest server so delete ur account on uni 5 as u can still make the same nick (spicy) on it. All the universes are like servers and all the XCU guys have moved to it for a fresh start so they told me to come on uni 40. I wouldn&#039;t be able to do joint raids with you if you wern&#039;t in the same uni as me.<br />Another problem may be that you might be that your planet may be to far from mine to do anything like defend you or join attacks or send cargo to you.<br /><br />My coordinate is 2:485:8<br /><br />ZION planet Levianth<br /><br />P.S.

But one thing im not convinced about is that now everyone can use the syringe.(the morphine jab) as many times they want with a time limit to the next use to stop them from dieing fast due to extra damage from buildings. they shoulda left it out IMO. still got shock paddles tho...never should they get rid of them lolz. :D ;)<br /><br />http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/battlefieldbadcompany2/video/6240858/battlefield-bad-company-2-battlefield-moments-episode-2</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IMO spiceman aka spicy is the best person to shout for a cd key as he has done something similar before with the private servers. As for bf2, it&#039;s also dieing due to bf bc 1/2 and bf3 releases so if you really would like to go for a fantastic first person shooter, and you&#039;ve seen some of the clips above, then keep your fingers fresh for the next bf versions coming out real soon. :)</div>
