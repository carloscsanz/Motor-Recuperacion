"/en/Operating_system">operating system</a> produced by <a href=
"/en/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> for use on <a href=
"/en/Personal_computer">personal computers</a>, including home and
business desktops, <a href="/en/Laptops">laptops</a>, and <a href=
"/en/Media_center">media centers</a>. It was released in <a href=
"/en/2001">2001</a>. The name &quot;XP&quot; is short for
&quot;eXPerience.&quot; <sup><small>[3]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">Windows XP is the successor to both <a href=
"/en/Windows_2000">Windows 2000 Professional</a> and <a href=
"/en/Windows_Me">Windows Me</a>, and is the first consumer-oriented
operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the <a href=
"/en/Windows_NT_kernel">Windows NT kernel</a> and <a href=
"/en/Architecture_of_the_Windows_NT_operating_system_line">architecture</a>.
Windows XP was first released on October 25, 2001, and over 400
million copies were in use in January 2006, according to an
estimate in that month by an <a href=
"/en/International_Data_Corporation">IDC</a> analyst.
<sup><small>[4]</small></sup> It was succeeded by <a href=
"/en/Windows_Vista">Windows Vista</a>, which was released to volume
license customers on November 8, 2006, and worldwide to the general
public on January 30, 2007. Direct <a href=
"/en/Original_Equipment_Manufacturer">OEM</a> and retail sales of
Windows XP ceased on June 30, 2008. Microsoft continued to sell XP
through their <a href="/en/Custom_built_PC">System Builders</a>
(smaller OEMs who sell assembled computers) program until January
31, 2009. <sup><small>[5]</small></sup>
<sup><small>[6]</small></sup> XP may continue to be available as
these sources run through their inventory or by purchasing Windows
Vista Ultimate or Business and then <a href=
"/en/Downgrade">downgrading</a> to Windows XP.
<sup><small>[7]</small></sup> <sup><small>[8]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">The most common editions of the operating system
are Windows XP Home Edition, which is targeted at home users, and
Windows XP Professional, which offers additional features such as
support for <a href="/en/Windows_Server_domain">Windows Server
domains</a> and <a href="/en/Symmetric_multiprocessing">two
physical processors</a>, and is targeted at power users, business
and enterprise clients. <a href=
"/en/Windows_XP_editions#Media_Center_Edition">Windows XP Media
Center Edition</a> has additional multimedia features enhancing the
ability to record and watch TV shows, view DVD movies, and listen
to music. <a href="/en/Windows_XP_Tablet_PC_Edition">Windows XP
Tablet PC Edition</a> is designed to run stylus applications built
using the <a href="/en/Tablet_PC">Tablet PC</a> platform.</p>
<p class="root">Windows XP was eventually released for two
additional architectures, <a href=
"/en/Windows_XP_editions#Windows_XP_64-Bit_Edition">Windows XP
64-bit Edition</a> for <a href="/en/IA-64">IA-64</a> (<a href=
"/en/Itanium">Itanium</a>) processors and <a href=
"/en/Windows_XP_editions#Windows_XP_Professional_x64_Edition">Windows
XP Professional x64 Edition</a> for <a href=
"/en/X86-64">x86-64</a>. There is also <a href=
"/en/Windows_XP_editions#Windows_XP_Embedded">Windows XP
Embedded</a>, a component version of the Windows XP Professional,
and editions for specific markets such as Windows XP Starter
Edition. By mid 2009, a manufacturer revealed the first Windows XP
powered cellular telephone. <sup><small>[9]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">The <a href="/en/Windows_NT">NT</a>-based versions
of Windows are known for their improved stability and efficiency
over the <a href="/en/Windows_9x">9x</a> versions of <a href=
"/en/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>.
<sup><small>[10]</small></sup> <sup><small>[11]</small></sup>
Windows XP presents a significantly redesigned <a href=
"/en/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</a>, a
change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than previous
versions of Windows. A new software management facility called
<a href="/en/Side-by-Side_Assembly">Side-by-Side Assembly</a> was
introduced to ameliorate the &quot;<a href="/en/DLL_hell">DLL
hell</a>&quot; that plagues 9x versions of Windows.
<sup><small>[12]</small></sup> <sup><small>[13]</small></sup> It is
also the first version of Windows to use <a href=
"/en/Product_activation">product activation</a> to combat <a href=
"/en/Copyright_infringement_of_software">illegal copying</a>, a
restriction that did not sit well with some users and privacy
advocates. Windows XP has also been criticized by some users for
security vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as
<a href="/en/Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</a> and
Windows Media Player, and for aspects of its default user
interface. Later versions with <a href=
"http://www.google.com/gwt/n?u=%23Service_Pack_2">Service Pack
2</a>, <a href=
"http://www.google.com/gwt/n?u=%23Service_Pack_3">Service Pack
3</a>, and <a href="/en/Internet_Explorer_8">Internet Explorer
8</a> addressed some of these concerns.</p>
<p class="root">During development, the project was <a href=
"/en/List_of_Microsoft_codenames">codenamed</a>
&quot;<strong>Whistler</strong>&quot;, after <a href=

employees <a href="/en/Skiing">skied</a> at the <a href=

<sup><small>[14]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">As of the end of February 2010, Windows XP is the
most widely used operating system in the world with a 58.4% market
share, having peaked at 76.1% in January 2007.
