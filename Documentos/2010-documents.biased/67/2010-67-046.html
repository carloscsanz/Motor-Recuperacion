Ronald S. Gabriszeski (Baltimore, Maryland USA)<br />I was mainly concerned with the weight of the product-- I don't like when things feel cheap. 
<br />
<br />This didn't at all.  Nicely made, does what it's supposed to.  After recieving this, I ordered another for my office.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.  <br /></p> <p><strong>Glad I bought it.</strong> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/network/star50_tpng.png" alt="5"  /> by .. Sandra L. Baker (New York City)<br />One of my biggest complaints is the battery life of the iPhone. This product is a great solution (at least until apple improves the battery life). I keep it on my desk at work. I can charge the phone as well as the spare battery at the same time (only when plugged into an outlet, only the phone charges if connected to the computer). At the end of the day, I put the spare in my bag and I don't have to worry about how much I use the phone while I'm out and about. I have used it quite often and have also come to the rescue of friends with a low charge. <br /></p> <p><strong>Not pleased with quality.</strong> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/network/star10_tpng.png" alt="1"  /> by .. LANDMAN ()<br />I can't say anything good about this product because the battery stopped taking a charge in less than one month of use.  It's totally dead. <br /></p> <p><strong>Works as advertised, but no headphone use while attached</strong> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/network/star40_tpng.png" alt="4"  /> by .. Michele (United States)<br />This is a really great product that extends the use of my iPod Touch (2G) for long flights. However, you need to be aware that you will not be able to use the headphone jack while the battery pack is attached, since it covers the entire bottom of the iPod touch. The battery pack charged my iPod quickly and fully in a short time, so that isn't a huge deal breaker, but dropped my review by one star. 
<br />
<br />I love that I can charge the iPod and the battery pack together using only one outlet. My battery pack and iPod attached to the cradle firmly with no connection problems.  I have only used this a few times so far, so it will be interesting to see if the battery pack life remains at high levels over time. <br /></p> <p><strong>Decent dock, but has issues with cases</strong> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/network/star30_tpng.png" alt="3"  /> by .. Patrick Watson (Alpharetta, GA USA)<br />As a dock, this product performs well as long as you use the provided Universal Dock inserts. However, if you happen to have a nice case that comes with a third party insert, the connection can be rather iffy. As long as you make sure to firmly press the iPhone into the dock, you'll be fine.
<br />
<br />The supplied battery is merely ok. It charged my iPhone extremely slowly; in fact, I suspect that it charged the phone only slightly faster than the iPhone used power. Additionally, the battery fits very snugly to the iPhone. This requires one to remove any case from the phone, which is a pain. <br /></p>
