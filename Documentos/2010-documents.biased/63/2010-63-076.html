		1. Introduction
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logo/Nvidia_GeForce.jpg" width="95" height="88" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Nvidia's 8800 series, managed to make a big impact, being the first DirectX 10 compliant graphics card ever sold on the market. The top model, the 8800GTX, is the current flagship of Nvidia with a massive 768MB of memory on board and of course a top price. This graphics card promises superb performance with all current and next generation games. At almost double the price of an 8800GTS 320MB, we were curious to see how much faster this &quot;monster&quot; is, and if users can really benefit from such a high priced graphics card.</p>
<p><strong>- Gainward BLISS 8800GTX 768 TV DD</strong></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.gainward.net/products/product.php?products_id=76" target="_blank"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/Logo_Slogan.jpg" width="400" height="48" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The BLISS  8800GTX 768 TV DD from Gainward, is powered by NVIDIA&acute;s&reg; GeForce&trade; 8800GTX GPU  integrating 768MB/384bits High-Speed DD3 memory, offering a mind blowing  experience for all 3D enthusiasts who think they have seen it all. Never  before have 3D rendering experiences appeared as life-like as with the  next generation GPU architecture from NVIDIA&reg;. Vivid ultra realistic  rendering of 3D projects and environments in the highest resolutions  without suffering any loss of it&acute;s kick-ass performance, makes  BLISS8800GTX from Gainward the only choice for hardcore gamers.  Reference clock settings for the BLISS8800GTX is a core clock of 575MHz  and a memory clock of 1800Mhz, though these already impressive settings  have been pushed to an incredible 620+MHz on the core and 1900+MHz on  the memory and has more to give under the right circumstances! This  card will rock your world and forever change your view of 3D graphics.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/8262_BP8800GTX_768M_TV_DD_P.jpg" width="300" height="197" /></p>
<p>The  GeForce&reg; 8800GTX graphics processing unit (GPU) delivers such a vast  amount of performance that none of the available processors (CPU&acute;s) on  the market are able to keep up with it; thus guaranteeing an  extraordinary performance today and tomorrow for future applications  and operating systems like Microsoft Windows Vista. </p>
<p>Comparing the 8800GTX with the 8800GTS, we have several interesting findings: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/comparison_with_8800gts.png" width="437" height="384" /></p>
<p>The fastest Gainward 8800GTX card you can buy, comes with 575MHz/1.80GHz clock speeds. For our tests, Gainward provided the &quot;8262-BLISS 8800GTX&quot; model. The card can be found online at  the retail price of <strong>&#8364;520</strong>. The retail box follows the usual design for Gainward graphics cards: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4702.jpg" width="460" height="322" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4703.jpg" width="440" height="296" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4704.jpg" width="440" height="378" /></p>



<p>To sum it up, the retail package includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A 8800GTX card</li>
  <li>A printed start manual (available in
English/French/German/Italian)</li>
  <li>2x   DVI-D to VGA converters </li>
  <li>2x power to PCI-E cables </li>
  <li>A TV-out cable (HDTV support)</li>
  <li>1x Software CD with  drivers</li>
  <li>Retail version of CyberLink PowerProducer and PowerDVD 6 </li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the card, it is a full  sized card, meaning you will  need an plenty of room to fit it in your case. The card takes up two backplane slots, the second being for the heat exhaust which blows air out the back of the case.  The cooling system covers both the memory modules and GPU core, and in most cases is very quiet:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4706.jpg" width="460" height="222" /></p>
<p>At the top, we can see two SLI connectors for using with other 8800GTX cards: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4708.jpg" width="440" height="197" /></p>
<p>The card has  two DVI-D  and  one HDTV outputs:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4707.jpg" width="400" height="545" /></p>
<p>In order to power up this little &quot;monster&quot;, you need at least a 600Watt PSU with two PCI-E lines. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4709.jpg" width="440" height="332" /></p>
<p>Here, you can see how much the 8800GTX card exceeds the size of a typical ATX motherboard. Be careful before buying! </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/IMG_4711.jpg" width="90" height="440" /></p>
<p>On the back of the card, we  see the sticker with the full model name, Part and Serial numbers: </p>

		2. Tests and setup 
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>Using Everest Ultimate Edition 2007, we can see more features for the Gainward 8800GTX card: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/everest.png" width="401" height="549" /></p>
<p> All tests were conducted with the same PC setup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asus M2N32 WS Pro Bios 1201  (Nvidia  590SLI) + AMD Athlon X2 4600+</li>
  <li>Thermaltake Soprano Case</li>
  <li>OCZ GameXStream GXS600 SLI-Ready</li>
  <li>2x1GB Crucial PC2-8000 @ 4-4-4-8-2T</li>
  <li>WD 800JB 7200RPM</li>
  <li>Viewsonic 19&quot; LCD VP930b (1280x1024 resolution) </li>
  <li>Windows XP SP2 with all latest updates installed </li>
  <li>Nvidia Forceware 8800 series <strong>v158.19 beta </strong> with the following settings</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/1.png" width="401" height="388" /></p>
<p>With the 8800 series, the 3D control panel has some minor changes. Users can now set the AA mode: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/2.png" width="462" height="139" /></p>
<p>And select up to 16x, even with a single card: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/3.png" width="455" height="102" /></p>
<p>From our tests, the 16x setting seems to have the same performance as 8x, so the best possible AA mode is 16xQ. We used numerous games and applications to evaluate the VGA card's performance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FRAPS v2.8.0</li>
  <li>3D Mark 05 v1.2.0</li>
  <li>3D Mark 06 v1.2.0</li>
  <li>F.E.A.R. v1.08</li>
  <li>Prey v1.2.0</li>
  <li>Half Life 2 Episode 1 June Edition</li>
  <li>Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory v1.05</li>
  <li>Battlefield 2142 v1.00</li>
  <li>Company Of Heroes v1.3.0</li>
  <li>NFS Carbon v1.2.0</li>
</ul>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		3. 3D Mark 05 - 3D Mark 06
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/3dmark05_logo.png" width="226" height="41" align="left" /> 3DMark&reg;05 is best suited for the latest generation of DirectX&reg;9.0 graphics cards. It is the first benchmark to require a DirectX9.0 compliant hardware with support for Pixel Shaders 2.0 or higher! By combining high quality 3D tests, CPU tests, feature tests, image quality tools, and much more, 3DMark05 is a premium benchmark for evaluating the latest generation of gaming hardware. 3DMark05 is the answer to the continuously growing challenge in benchmarking!</p>
<p>For all tests, we used the default settings from 3DMark05 as follows: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/3dmark05_settings.png" width="376" height="197" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/3dmark05.png" width="479" height="306" /></p>
<p>3D Mark 05 is a well know benchmark utility that represents the combination of CPU+VGA strength. The Gainward 8800GTX was, as expected, faster than the 8800GTS models, but slower than a 8800GTS 320 SLI setup.</p>
<p><strong>- 3D Mark 06 v1.0.2 </strong></p>
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/3dmark_06_logo.gif" width="266" height="55" align="left" />3DMark&reg;06 is the worldwide standard in advanced 3D game performance benchmarking and the latest version in the popular 3DMark series! 3DMark06 tests include all new HDR/SM3.0 graphics tests, advanced SM2.0 graphics tests, AI and physics driven single and multiple cores or processor CPU tests and a collection of comprehensive feature tests to reliably measure next generation gaming performance today. Futuremark's exclusive Online ResultBrowser web service tracks and compares 3DMark06 scores. Again we left all settings at default: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/3dmark06_settings.png" width="382" height="210" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/3dmark06.png" width="479" height="305" /> </p>
<p>In 3D Mark 06, the 8800GTX is again faster than the 8800GTS models.</p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		4. F.E.A.R.
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/FEAR_Logo.jpg" width="274" height="66" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />The story begins as an unidentified paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound. The government responds by sending in Special Forces, but loses contact as an eerie signal interrupts radio communications. When the interference subsides moments later, the team has been literally torn apart. As part of a classified strike team created to deal with threats no one else can handle, your mission is simple: Eliminate the intruders at any cost. Determine the origin of the signal. And contain this crisis before it spirals out of control.</p>
<p>For all tests, we used the latest available patch that updates the game engine to v1.08. The game  offers  1280x1024 resolution, which was used for all tests. We maxed all details for CPU and  VGA card, except  Soft Shadows and AA/AF. We used Nvidia's  3D Control panel to enable AA/AF as indicated in each graph.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/FEAR_1.jpg" width="460" height="272" /></p>
<p> Below are the results after using the built-in benchmark test: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/fear_1.png" width="480" height="321" /></p>
<p>F.E.A.R. is a demanding game and the 8800GTX performed very well, delivering up to 126FPS (average). It would be interesting to now see which card suffers the least performance impact after enabling AA/AF: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/fear_2.png" width="485" height="433" /></p>
<p>Enabling AA/AF impacts on the  performance of all tested  cards. The 8800GTX and 8800GTS 320 SLI are very close, and at AF/16xQ AA the 8800GTX is a couple of FPS faster.</p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		5. Prey 
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/prey.jpg" width="240" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />Prey tells the story of Tommy, a Cherokee garage mechanic stuck on a reservation going nowhere. His life changes when an otherworldly crisis forces him to awaken spiritual powers from his long-forgotten birthright. Abducted along with his people to a menacing mothership orbiting Earth, he sets out to save himself and his girlfriend and eventually his planet. </p>
<p>Prey is serious, dark story, based on authentic Cherokee mythology. Themes of sacrifice, love and responsibility are explored and the story dives into emotional territory not yet explored by similar games. Prey is  based on Quake 3 engine and for sure will keep you awake many nights... </p>
<p> We used the latest available patch that updated the game engine to v1.2.0. For all tests, we used <a href="http://www.hocbench.com/prey.html" target="_blank">hocbench</a> which offers all benchmarking options through a GUI. We used the built-in Guru3D timedemo and all results are posted below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/prey_1.png" width="480" height="329" /></p>
<p>Without enabling AA/AF, the Gainward 8800GTX outperformed the 8800GTS 320SLI!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/prey_2.png" width="478" height="431" /></p>
<p> Enabling the various AA/AF rendering modes, we see that after 4x AA, the 8800GTS 320 SLI outperformed the 8800GTX and suffers far less as the effects are piled on.</p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		6. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/splintercell3.gif" width="240" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />A Japanese Information Defense Force is formed to help face modern threats. Deemed a violation of international law and of the Japanese Post-War Constitution, Korea and China become outraged. </p>
<p>Secretly, the head of the IDF begins launching information-warfare attacks against Japan and blaming the attacks on North Korea. When the U.S. intervenes, as they are obligated to under Article 9 of the Japanese Post-War Constitution, the U.S. is attacked as well, forcing North Korea to escalate the situation with a pre-emptive invasion of South Korea. As war erupts on the Korean Peninsula, Sam Fisher must thwart the alliance between the Japanese Admiral, a neurotic computer hacker, and the head of an international paramilitary company in order to prevent the rekindling of a massive world war in the Pacific.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/splinter_cell_moresm3.png" width="468" height="376" /></p>
<p>The graphics engine supports  Pixel Shader 1 and 3, HDR  along with other new effects. We used <a href="http://www.hocbench.com/scellCT.html" target="_blank">hocbench</a> which offers all benchmarking options from an easy GUI. We used the built-in &quot;Guru3D 2&quot; timedemo and all results are posted below, using SM1.1 </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/spcell_1.png" width="481" height="327" /></p>
<p> Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory also supports Shader Model 3.0 that can be enabled easily from within the <a href="http://www.hocbench.com/scellCT.html" target="_blank">hocbench</a> software: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/splinter_cell_sm3.png" width="445" height="441" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/spcell_2.png" width="479" height="328" /></p>
<p>Similar performance from 8800GTX and 8800GTS 320 SLI.</p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		7. Half Life 2 Episode 1
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>The world of Half-Life 2 has amazed everyone with its great story, graphics and Valve's great support. Half-Life 2: Episode One is the first in a series of new adventures created by Valve that extend the Half-Life 2 single player experience. It details the aftermath of Half Life 2 and launches a journey beyond City 17.</p>
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/half_life_episode1.jpg" width="213" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />Stepping into the hazard suit of Dr. Gordon Freeman, you face the immediate repercussions of your actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Rejoin Alyx Vance and her robot, Dog, to once again aid the human resistance in their desperate battle against the totalitarian alien menace of the Combine.</p>
<p>Episode One exposes Alyx's combat skills and knowledge of City 17. Battle side-by-side with her through Valve's first episodic game, a four-to-six hour adventure of greater density and detail than non-episodic releases.</p>
<p>We  recorded a timedemo and used the built-in console to run the timedemo for each card. All tests were carried out  at 1280x1024, with HDR shadows fully enabled. Antialiasing and Filtering modes were enabled from Nvidia's 3D control panel: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/hl2 2006-09-22 21-26-45-93.jpg" width="484" height="298" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/hl2_1.png" width="475" height="319" /></p>
<p>At 1280x1024,  no AA/AF and HDR enabled, there's not much between the cards.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/hl2_2.png" width="479" height="432" /></p>
<p>HDR Effects and  AA/AF  do have an effect on performance. With the highest possible visual quality settings  after enabling 8xQ AA, the Gainward 8800GTX suffers a major drop in performance.</p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		8. Company Of Heroes 
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/companyheroes.jpg" width="300" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />In Company of Heroes, gamers will experience the journey of the brave men of Able Company in a deep single-player campaign that begins with the invasion of Normandy through their fight across Europe, all set against the most dynamic battlefield ever seen in a game. </p>
<p>Company of Heroes' completely destructible environment means no two battles ever play out in the same way. Advanced squad AI delivers startling new realism and responsiveness, bringing soldiers to life as they interact with the environment and execute advanced squad tactics to eliminate the opposition forces.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/COF_Pic.jpg" width="440" height="294" /></p>
<p>The game offers impressive graphics, especially when maxing out all visual quality settings. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/COH_HighDetail.jpg" width="480" height="355" /></p>



<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/COH_Sound.jpg" width="480" height="390" /></p>
<p> We used the built-in benchmark for all tests at  1280x1024 resolution. Since AA/AF cannot be set from within game, we used Nvidia's 3D control panel for each mode. The built-in Antialiasing setting for Company Of Heroes has been disabled. Let's see how the card performed in the Company Of Heroes Benchmark with High Quality settings. </p>

	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/battlefield2142.jpg" width="240" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />The year is 2142, and the dawn of a new Ice age has thrown the world into a panic. The math is simple and brutal: The soil not covered by ice can only feed a fraction of the Earth's population. Some will live, most will die. In Battlefield 2142, players will choose to fight for one of two military superpowers in an epic battle for survival, the European Union or the newly formed Pan Asian Coalition. </p>
<p>Armed with a devastating arsenal of hi-tech assault rifles, cloaking devices and sentry guns, players will also do battle using some of the most imposing vehicles known to man. Massive battle Mechs wage fierce combat on the ground, while futuristic aircraft rule the skies. When facing one of these new behemoths, players will need to use their wits and an arsenal of new countermeasures like EMP grenades to level the playing field. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/bf2142_pic.jpg" width="440" height="295" /></p>
<p>Team play features allow up to 64 players to enter the action on the front lines as part of a formal squad, or work behind the scenes in Commander Mode to direct the strategic assaults of their teammates. With in-game success, players increase their rank and unlock awards, including new weapons, medals and more, delivering the most comprehensive and flexible persistence in the Battlefield universe to date.</p>

<p>In order to benchmark the graphics card, we recorded our own timedemo using the built-in command (demo.recordDemo). Then we used the Guru3D BF2 benchmark modified, in order to support BF 2142. We used the following quality settings: anti-aliasing is disabled by default in the game, and we used Nvidia's 3D Control Panel to enable/disable the AA/AF rendering modes:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logos/BF2142_2.jpg" width="480" height="385" /></p>
<p>Note that 1280x1024 resolution is not supported in the game. However, it can be enabled from the command line. Since the game counts all frames, including loading screens, we removed them so that all figures represent pure gaming experience. Note, that all tests were performed at 1280x1024 with the default camera view. Let's now proceed to the test results. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/battlefield_1.png" width="480" height="330" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/battlefield_2.png" width="478" height="433" /></p>
<p>Enabling AA/AF in Battlefield 2142 enhances visual quality and of course gaming experience. As we can see, the Gainward 8800GTX is neck and neck with the 8800GTS 320SLI setup  until 6x AA, where its performance slowly drops off.</p>

    <em>Black and beautiful... </em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that all tests results were done  with &quot;Blur Effect&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; <strong>disabled</strong>, since enabling them  gives a huge performance hit on all cards. In any case, all other detail settings are maxed out.  As usual, AA/AF modes are set from Nvidia's 3D control panel. Without enabling AA/AF, we can see the performance for each card at 1280x1024. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/nfs_1.png" width="473" height="321" /></p>
<p>NFS Carbon is a game that usually performs better with ATI cards. The Gainward 8800GTX showed superb performance with 76FPS in all rendering modes: </p>

		11. Overclocking
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>There is always a way to improve the performance of your system by overclocking it.  We were curious to see if the card could handle even higher clock frequencies. Using coolbits registry &quot;hack&quot;, we enabled the overclocking features in Nvidia's control panel. We tried Ntune to find the optimal performance, but the system was halted every time we tried.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/1.jpg" width="429" height="139" /></p>
<p> Our next attempts were with RivaTuner v2.00 Final, which was a success. Overclocking was selectable! Next step was the trial and error process, raising the frequency, running 3D Mark06 to stress test the VGA card and seeing if  we had a stable system. Our best trials are shown below, including the stock clock frequencies for comparison:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/general_oc.png" width="429" height="89" /></p>
<p>The Gainward 8800GTX proved to be  overclockable but only with a 7.83% improvement for the GPU core and 11.11%  for the memory.  After setting the highest possible clocks, we re-ran a few tests to see if performance  improved at all.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/3dmark05_oc.png" width="329" height="92" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/3dmark06_oc.png" width="327" height="91" /></p>
<p>3D Mark05 and 3D Mark 06 are affected by the increase in GPU and Memory clocks, but only by a small margin. We don't think that users will gain much from overclocking the Gainward 8800GTX. On the other hand, the 8800GTS seems to  benefit more from overclocking, as the above results showed.</p>

		112. Conclusion
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/logo/nvidia_twimtbp.gif" width="80" height="80" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Nvidia's  8800GTX series offer the highest performance a user can buy nowadays. Before testing the Gainward 8800GTX, we were curious to see how much improvement a user can expect from buying the most expensive 3D graphic card, at least for gaming use. The price of the Gainward 8800GTX  is around &euro;522, while the 8800GTS 640 at &euro;400 and the 8800GTS 320 at  &euro;320~&euro;350. Based on the the retail prices, some might think that pairing two 8800GTS 320 could achieve the performance of a 8800GTX, something we   also looked at in this review.</p>
<p>From our tests, in the majority of games, the 8800GTX's performance was excellent, compared with the 8800GTS 640 and 320MB models. On the other hand, pairing two Gainward 8800GTS GS 320MB gave better performance in some games (F.E.A.R., Prey, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, HL2 Episode 1, BattleField 2142), while in other cases, the increased  on board memory of 768MB, made the difference (NFS Carbon, Company Of Heroes). So it seems that most current games will benefit from a 8800GTS SLI setup, while specific games can run even faster on a single 8800GTX card. In any case, the 8800GTX is a single card, so imagine adding a second one in the near future, when prices will have  dropped. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/G/Gainward 8800GTX/Images/gainward/8262_BP8800GTX_768M_TV_DD_P.jpg" width="300" height="197" /></p>
<p>The card supports HDCP output from the two DVI-D ports, and is rated as VISTA ready. This means users won't have to worry about compatibility, only the retail price. If money is not a problem for you, then the Gainward 8800GTX will become your best 3D gaming friend. Just remember to check the space inside your case. This card is full size and takes up two backplane slots. You also need a heavy duty PSU, since this little &quot;monster&quot; requires two +12V PCI-E power lines to work properly :-) </p>
