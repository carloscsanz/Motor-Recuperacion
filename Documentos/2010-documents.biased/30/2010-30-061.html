				<p>With thousands of new users signing up each day to the social networking powerhouse Facebook, its growing domination of the Internet audience presents a lucrative channel for businesses to market their products.<span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>The challenge for any business is to find the best way to capture the attention of Facebook’s IT-savvy users. Below are a few approaches that can help position your business right in the midst of the social networking scene.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Ads</strong></p>
<p>Facebook ads is one of the first signs of Facebook being monetised. It allows businesses to target users by homing in on information contained within the Facebook profiles &#8211; age, social interests, hobbies, relationship status, favourite TV shows – or whatever quirky criteria helps distinguish a target group from the average Facebook user. The ads are then displayed when the target group logs on to their Facebook profile.</p>
<p>In an effort to reach the masses in a different way, this year’s Australian Idol also advertised their auditions on Facebook. Talk about targeted advertising hitting its target.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Events</strong></p>
<p>If you have a conference, product launch or a function, Facebook Events is a handy tool to organize and promote your event.</p>
<p>Setting up an event is easy. Simply upload your event details using Facebook Events, send the invitation to friends, and your event is just one step away from receiving its first guest on the red carpet. Efficiency in organising the event is greatly improved as it lets you receive guest responses in real time. Best of all, it only takes minutes to create and send an invite.</p>
<p>In February this year, the BBC news posted an online report that demonstrated the pulling power of Facebook Events. As many as two million people took to the streets in Columbia to protest against Marxist rebel group FARC. Out of those that attended the protest, 100,000 people (from the 320,000 that were invited) responded to the Facebook Events invite.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Pages</strong></p>
<p>New on the Facebook platform are Facebook Pages which are customised profiles designed specifically to allow businesses, brands and even celebrities to interact with people online. Allowing all forms of promotion, this is a unique and more subtle way to market your products and services to Facebook users.</p>
<p>Thinking outside the box is the key to successfully using Facebook Pages, as the CIA has discovered. The CIA’s Facebook Page isn’t keeping any secrets on their ideal agent recruit, judging from the 30-second YouTube recruitment video clearly aimed at potential college-aged applicants.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Applications</strong></p>
<p>For those with a little more technical know-how, you can create a useful application for Facebook users that allows your brand to receive some ‘viral’ exposure.</p>
<p>An application is something users can add to their page to allow some sort of interaction. Some examples of applications include picture galleries, RSS feeds from websites and live temperature reports.</p>
<p>Skittles recently tapped into the “gifts” application under the profile pages of Facebook users to market their sweets. What they have done is allow users to send an image of a packet of Skittles as a virtual gift to friends, which goes beyond the generic and non-branded options available such as virtual toys, teddy bears and balls. Such an application turns the common practice of sending virtual gifts into a means of subliminal viral marketing. Ultimately, this helps to promote the Skittles brand in a captive online audience.</p>
<p><strong>The emerging face of doing business online </strong></p>
<p>The growth of Facebook has been phenomenal and it increases every day. Seize the potential it presents to your business while it is still the new hot thing. The word from industry experts is, it’s only a matter of time a new player takes over the social networking scene.</p>

			<p>What great information.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never visited facebook, and you have your own website, you owe it to yourself to go check it out and start participating.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that humour ranks highly on youtube and you may consider employing similar tried &amp; proven methods on facebook. You can often have a whole lot of people laughing along with you, all the way to the bank <img src='http://successbox.melbourneitblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>There has never been a time when you could have a website and sit back to watch the money roll in. Owners of succesfull sites work hard at obtaining their position and keeping it. Research and implementation of various methods to promote your site are just a natural part of what&#8217;s required for success.</p>
<p>Go for it and make it and write your own success story.</p>
