I'm writing this for pedagogical reasons.  So basically this is just illustrating javascript.  So I don't want or need anythign in the body. <br />

  Try this code snippet instead.  XHTML 1.1 won't even allow a &lt;body&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/body&gt; at the end.  I think it wants a block/list/heading type content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the XHTML tag &lt;br /&gt; you will need &lt;br \/&gt; instead.<br />
<br />
It is not valid to put &lt;!-- comment --&gt; tags around the javascript code in XHTML. You may find that some browsers completely ignore your javascript code. Remove the comment tags.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I must say that I see no reason why this has to be done as XHTML when HTML 4 would have sufficed. XHTML has problems depending on which MIME type you serve it with. It should be served as XML but doing that breaks most current browsers.</div></div><hr />

there isn't any &lt;td&gt; tags as you can see. the only tag is the break tag. the validator isn't even complaining about that, it is complaining about the body tags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airick</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell me if I have this straight: <br />
<br />
this code validates if I just put something in between the body tags.  But technically, xhtml 1.1 browsers  ignore anything between &lt;!--  --&gt;.  <br />
<br />
However, this code will work in IE6 because it treats everythign as text/html at the time being. <br />
<br />
If I were to have the javascript code work in xhtml 1.1 compliant browser serving stuff up in text/xml, I would have to remove the &lt;!--   --&gt;   and be careful about --, &amp;, or &lt;, within the script code within comments. <br />
<br />
Do you know much about JScript .Net or when the new ECMAScript 262 edition 4 standard might come out?<br />
<br />
I have another question, in the s3c validator, is <br />
Content-Type:  text/xml   the same as  MIME type   ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &lt;/td&gt; tag was an example of how to do a tag in the &lt;/xx&gt; form, by using &lt;\/xx&gt;.<br />

Then I posted a specific as to how to do one in the &lt;xx /&gt; form, specifically the &lt;br /&gt; tag, rewritten as &lt;br \/&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Setting it to this causes problems with a lot of browsers anyway. Therefore set it to text/html (which validates for XHTML 1.0 Transitional). If you want to still validate as XHTML1.1 then change copy the DTD and change it to accept text/html. <br />
<br />
Also, it is highly recommended when embedding javascript code to create a source file and call it using the src attribute (as opposed to embedding it inline). This is because strictly speaking javascript text is CDATA (because you would otherwise need to use a lot of entities, etc).<br />
<br />
And Scoutt re: your comment (&quot;now I know why I hate XML&quot;) this has nothing to do with XML, the rules you refer to are rules from the SGML of the HTML 4.01 specification and not XHTML (and certainly not any XML (which has no knowledge of predefined HTML tags)).</div></div><hr />

I have never seen that error in regular html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torrent</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trust me on this one. The rules which decide what tag can follow what tag, which ones must have content and which should and can not, are all determined through the HTML's SGML (in other words the HTML 4.01 specification). <br />
<br />
Take a look at the XHTML 1.0 specification and try to find where it says anything at all about a specific tag! I will wager you will find no reference to any HTML tag in the entire spec.<br />
<br />
Here's a quote from W3CHTML 4.01 is a revision of the HTML 4.0 Recommendation first released on 18th December 1997. The revision fixes minor errors that have been found since then. The XHTML 1.0 spec relies on HTML 4.01 for the meanings of XHTML elements and attributes. This allowed us to reduce the size of the XHTML 1.0 spec very considerably.When you validate a document against XHTML 1.0 be aware that this is actually validating your document against both HTML4.01 and the XHTML 1.0 specifications!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scoutt</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so you are saying that regular html doesn't allow this either<br />
<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
<br />
because that is what it errored on. maybe I don't understand that error then. I am not arguing with you as I know squat about XHTML, I am just trying to wrap my head around that error.<br />
<br />
if you change the doctype and validate it as HTML, then that error will come up too? that is what I am saying, I have never seen that error in regular HTML. not that it doesn't exist, I just never seen it.<br />
<br />
in fact if you do, it doesn't error on that, it just says valid html transistional. so see that error is from XHTML, not HTML as it validates</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">torrent</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just tried to validate the document from this post&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />

&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
 and receive this errorBelow are the results of attempting to parse this document with an SGML parser. <br />
<br />
Line 22, column 20: end tag for &quot;body&quot; which is not finished (explain...). <br />
  &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;Note the point about the SGML parser? That means it has located something which contravenes the HTML4.01 specification and not the XHTML specification. Dissecting this further, take a look at the HTML (not XHTML) specification. We see this definition of the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; element&lt;!ELEMENT BODY O O (%block;|SCRIPT)+ +(INS|DEL) -- document body --&gt;<br />
&lt;!ATTLIST BODY<br />
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --<br />
  onload          %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the document has been loaded --<br />
  onunload        %Script;   #IMPLIED  -- the document has been removed --<br />
  &gt;<br />
The first line is the one we are interested in for our example. Notably the part which says:<br />
<br />
(%block;|SCRIPT)+<br />
<br />
This means that the opening &lt;body&gt; tag MUST be followed by either a &lt;script&gt; element or, more importantly in our case, an element defined in the %block entity. The + means that one or more of these must occur, but whatever the case there must at least be one of them!<br />
<br />
Now, let's take a look at the %block entity.&lt;!ENTITY % block<br />
     &quot;P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | NOSCRIPT |<br />
      BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | HR | TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS&quot;&gt;<br />
Only the elements which are stated here are permissable after the &lt;body&gt; tag. Some are explicitly stated, such as the &lt;p&gt; element, and some are implied through further entity references, such as %heading. One thing you will note (if you follow the entity references) is that it is not HTML 4.01 compliant to follow a &lt;body&gt; tag with a &lt;br&gt; element.<br />
<br />
So, in short, the failure both you and I observe is a failure to comply with the HTML4.01 specification, and not the XHTML one. In my case this is because the &lt;body&gt; element is empty (not permissable), and in your earlier post's example, because the &lt;body&gt; element contained a &lt;br&gt; element, also not permissable.<br />
<br />
Hope this is all making sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scoutt</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that is where you are wrong. this does validate as HTML 4.0<br />

It is failing the HTML4.01 validation. The reason you get it to validate is because you validate it against the HTML 4.01 Transitional DTD and not against the HTML 4.01 Strict DTD, which XHTML plugs into.<br />
<br />
Try this at the top of your file&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;<br />
            &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;<br />
and tell me now if it validates? Do the error messages look familiar? They are the ones you saw when you tried to validate against XHTML (and consequently blamed as to the reason the validation failed). My point was and is that the failures you saw were not anything to do with XML, XHTML, or the third cycle of the moon. :) They are failures against HTML 4's SGML.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps to clarify the situation ;)</div></div><hr />
