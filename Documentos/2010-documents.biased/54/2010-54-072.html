				<div class="entry">
					<p>It is common knowledge within the SEO <a title="SEO Search Engine Optimisation" href="http://www.firebubble.co.uk/internet-marketing">Search Engine Optimisation</a> industry that building links from other websites pointing to your Website helps you attain a higher position in the search engine listings for relevant search terms / keywords. This part of the optimisation process is easy to grasp, you simply build links through other websites that point to your own website. The more difficult part of this strategy is knowing which links have value and which links are just additional ways for a business or individual to waste their time. So an important factor in any link building strategy is to know which links have value. There are many factors which influence the strength of a link through the eyes of the search engines such as Google and Yahoo. These factors can be titled as Relevant, Keywords, Indexed, Page Rank and Non-Harmful.</p>
<h2>Relevant</h2>
<p>If you want strong links to your site then you need relevant links from web pages that contain content which is relevant to your own website. For example you do not want to build links to a logo design website from a page about wooden fences! This is a bad move. You need links from relevant and authentic web pages, it&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>The most important thing you need before beginning any seo / link building journey is a list of relevant keywords / search terms that people use to find websites such as your own. If you created your list of keywords / search terms in a matter of minutes you probably did it wrong. Many people make the mistake of picking the most obvious search terms / keywords but these terms usually have many competitors all fighting to get to the top of the Google and Yahoo listings.</p>
<p>A new website stands little chance of building a strong online presence when they try to compete with the bigger websites that have been online for years. You need to be realistic about your chances of obtaining a position in the search engines that will be beneficial to you. Fortunately though for the smaller websites while the big websites are fighting over the giant search terms, small websites can focus on the niche keywords / search terms. For example if you have a website about Search Engine Optimisation, then rather that building links for the search term &#8216;Search Engine Optimisation&#8217; you could try involving the area in which you offer this service, for example you could have <a title="SEO Search Engine Optimisation Leicester" href="http://www.firebubble.co.uk/internet-marketing">&#8216;Search Engine Optimisation Leicester&#8217;</a> for your key phrase and you would stand a far greater chance of achieving a listing in the search engines that will provide visitors to your website.</p>
<p>There are lots of these keyword niches so it is often a good idea to have a few niche key phrases that will generate a reasonable amount of visitors to your website or &#8216;traffic&#8217; as it is known in the SEO industry. You should build your links to your website from other websites containing your niche keywords.</p>
<h2>Indexed</h2>
<p>Not all pages on the internet are indexed / read by the search engines. In fact lots of web pages that you can build links from will not be indexed. This means that your links will also not be read by the search engines and from an SEO point of view this is not good. If the links are not indexed then they will not count. Although it can be good to have links from popular websites that do not offer indexed pages as if the pages have a lot of visitors they can click through to your site but this will not strengthen your website in the eyes of the search engines it will only send a number of visitors to your website and this number is usually very small. To check if the blog or article website you are building links from will be indexed you need to look at the source code for the web page this will tell you if the page will be indexed or not. If the page contain no follow / index instructions to the search engines then the page will not be indexed and neither will your links that you build from that page.</p>
<h2>Page Rank</h2>
<p>Page Rank or PR as it is known in the SEO trade is a score that Google awards your website based on how important Google feels your website to be. Many people get too obsessive over Page Rank but it can serve as a good indication of how your website is doing with respect to its SEO in comparison to other websites. The Page Rank or PR which google awards to each page on a website is marked out of 10.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to achieve a PR 10 and it is very unlikely that a PR of 9 will be achieved by a business website (PR 9 is more realistic for massive websites like Facebook and Myspace). A realistic PR to aim for would be a PR 4 or PR 5 website. Page Ranks are achievable of higher but this is really for individuals and businesses that really understand the world of SEO and work many hours to achieve the results. It is usually not necessary to have an extremely high Page Rank though for Business services and you can easily find your website top of the Google and Yahoo listings with only a PR 2 if you choose the right Key phrase.</p>
<h2>Non Harmful</h2>
<p>Building links to your websites is generally a safe business but there are a few circumstances to avoid. The first is to not only join blogs just to post comments that are only intended to build links. Try posting useful informative comments about the subject. You should try to enjoy blogging rather than just spamming / ruining the blog for everybody else by posting meaningless links (to humans) just to achieve better search engine results. You may also be thrown off the blog website if you are not respectful towards it. They are there to provide useful information and to be an enjoyable experience not just for link building.</p>
<p>Another link building strategy to show caution towards is the exchange of links. Once your website begins to show a little strength in the search engines you will no doubt be contacted by other website owners asking to exchange links. This is usually done by you placing a link pointing towards their website and they place a link on their website pointing towards your website. This is usually ok but you should only link to relevant websites and also you should expect a PR of the same value from the page you are receiving a link from. As you do not want to add a link from your own web page that has a PR of 2 when the other website only has a PR0 on the web page that contains your link.</p>
<p>You should try to build links that are informative to your websites visitors as it is all too easy to forget that it is your visitors you need to impress more than the search engines. You should also never link to link farms as these websites are frowned upon by the search engines and can seriously damage your websites integrity. Link farms are websites that only promote links they have no useful information they are only there to trick the search engines and they all get caught in the end. Do not confuse these with directories that list business services they are usually fine. If you are unsure about linking to a website then it is probably best to either seek advice or not bother with the link.</p>
