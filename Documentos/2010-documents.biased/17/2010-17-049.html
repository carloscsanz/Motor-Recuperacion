Since 2001, Sapphire has been the key ATI graphics board supplier worldwide. Recently ATI has released a new line of video cards and of course, Sapphire has been right along with them, releasing their own lineup.  Sapphire has sent us their new mainstream video card, the Radeon X1300.  Let&#39;s see how it holds up to our tests.<br /><br /><span style='font-size:13pt;line-height:100%'><b>Specifications/Features:</b></span><br /><br />-	Radeon X1300 - 450MHz Core <br />-	512MB/256MB/128MB of DDR2/DDR1 - 500 MHz Memory (256MB Review Sample)<br />-	128-bit or 64-bit memory interface <br />-	4 Pixel Pipelines <br />-	PCI Express x16 <br />-	RAMDAC - 2x400MHz <br />-	FullStream (Video-deblocking) - Real, divX, WM9 <br />-	Single slot passive (silent) cooling solution <br />-	Maximum 3D Graphics Resolution of 2560x1600 <br />-	Hydravision 3, Dual Display support<br />-	Shader Model 3.0<br />-	SuperAA<br />-	HDTV Compatible (YPbPr)<br /><br /><b>Specifications and Features:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><span style='font-size:13pt;line-height:100%'><b>Overview:</b></span><br /><br />The Sapphire Radeon X1300 came in the standard style of ATI box, making it very familiar when you see it on a shelf.  The front of the box lists the major features of the card such as PCI Express, 256MB, DVI, VGA, and TV-Out.  Decorating the front is a little green alien holding what looks like the planet Earth in his hands.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300002.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300002_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div> <br /><br />The back of the box lists some product highlights and what is in the box.  There is also an open window on the back that allows you to see the card inside the box.  This is the first glimpse of what the card actually looks like <br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300003.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300003_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />After opening up the outer box you find a stronger cardboard box for protection. It is inside this box that the video card and all the contents are held.  The packaging of the card is quite well done; there should be no worries about the condition of the card upon arrival.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300005.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300005_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br /><i>Contents:</i><br /><br />-	Radeon X1300 video card<br />-	Getting Started User?s Manual<br />-	Installation CD<br />-	S-Video Cable<br />-	DVI to VGA adapter<br />-	Component Video Out cable<br />-	Composite Video Out cable<br />-	Composite Video adapter<br /><br /><i>Software Bundle:</i><br /><br />-	Cyberlink PowerDVD 5<br />-	Sapphire Select Game CD (choice of one of the four)<br />o	Tony Hawk Underground 4<br />o	Prince of Persia: Warrior Within<br />o	Richard Burns Rally<br />o	Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300006.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300006_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />The first thing I noticed after getting the box open was that the card itself was not in an anti-static bag.  It was sitting on a piece of foam; the other side of the card was against the plastic housing so you could see it out the back window.  It may be nice to see it out the back but it would be nice to have a working card upon arrival.  The next thing I noticed about the card was that it only has a passive heatsink on it.  There is no fan on the card to help with cooling. As long as the card doesn?t run too hot this should not be a problem.  However for the mainstream market that this card is designed for this is a great idea, it is one less fan to quit or get full of dust in a computer that gets neglected. Since this is a mainstream board it only has a single DVI connector along with a VGA connector.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300008.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300008_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a> <a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300012_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a> <a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300014.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/x1300014_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />One of the small things that I noticed and was nice to see, was the size of the S-Video cable, generally they tend to be very thin cables and have cheap ends.  This one is thick and has solid ends.  Even though few people still use S-Video it is a nice change to see a decent quality cable in the box.  The S-Video cable is six feet long; this is the same length as the Composite cable.  The Component cable is only a splitter that attaches to the back of the video card; you will need to supply your own Component video cable if you plan on using this output format.<br /><br />The Sapphire Select game CD is a nice idea for keeping the cost of the product down.  The CD allows you to try a demo of all four games and then choose the one you like the most by using the included key to unlock the full version.<br /><br /><b>Overview:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><span style='font-size:13pt;line-height:100%'><b>Performance:</b></span><br /><br />To test the performance of the Sapphire Radeon X1300, I played Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, Battlefield 2: Special Forces recording the FPS with Fraps, and ran the Doom 3 timedemo.  On top of the 3 game tests, I also ran 3DMark 05 to get a 3DMark score as well as game 3 on its own.  These tests were all run in Windows XP Pro and well as Windows XP x64.<br /><br /><i>Test System:</i><br /><br />Antec Titan Server case<br />Antec True Power 2.0 550W PSU<br />Gigabyte GA-K8N Pro-SLI<br />Athlon64 3000+ @ 2.5 GHz<br />Kingston HyperX PC4300 DDR RAM<br />Seagate Barracuda 7200.9 500GB SATA3G 16MB Cache Hard Drive<br /><br /><b>Half-Life 2: Lost Coast</b><br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/hl2screen.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/hl2screen_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />To test Half-Life 2: Lost Coast I started the Fraps benchmark at a save point I made just after the old man opens the gate.  I allowed the benchmark to record all the way up the hillside and stopped it as soon as I ran through the hallway at the top. The test was run with Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering set to 2x and 4x respectively as well as full HDR lighting and then at the same ?High? detail with these features turned off.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/hl2lc.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></div><br /><br />Half-Life 2 was playable at 1024x768 with both of the settings I tested at but when everything was turned off it ran very well.  The quality dropped a little at the lower settings but the improved performance was worth it.<br /><br /><b>Battlefield 2: Special Forces</b><br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/bf2screen.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/bf2screen_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />The Battlefield 2: Special Forces tests were run on the Devil?s Perch level in the dark. The tests were run at 1024x768 with the detail set at High, Med, and Low, as well as at 1280x1024 on High detail.  The Fraps benchmark was started as soon as I spawned at the beginning of a single player game and ran until I was killed.  This ended up usually being about a minute or two into the round.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/bf2sf.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></div><br /><br />Battlefield 2 ran ok at all of the tested settings but was only playable at 1024x768 and low detail.  The other settings were not worth the extra detail for the lower framerates.<br /><br /><b>Doom 3</b> <br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/doom3screen.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/doom3screen_thumb.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></a></div><br /><br />For Doom 3 I ran the included timedemo three times and took the average of the three scores. I ran the test at 1024x768 at High, Medium, and Low quality as well as 1280x1024 at High quality.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/doom3.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></div><br /><br />Doom 3 didn&#39;t make much of a difference which settings were used.  All three detail levels on 1024x768 ran basically the same speed.<br /><br /><b>3DMark 05</b><br /><br />I first ran the standard 3DMark tests to get a 3DMark score for this card in my test system.  I then ran only the 3rd game test at 1280x1024 with 4xAA and 4xAF and recorded the frame rate.<br />3DMARK Graphs<br /><br /><div align="center"><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/3dmark05.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /><br /><img src="http://images.planetamd64.com/phatsob/sapphire/x1300/3dmark05g3.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" /></div><br /><br />Since this is a mainstream product with no active cooling, I ran no overclocking tests on this video card.<br /><br />For a mainstream video card to be able to play power hungry games like Battlefield 2 at playable frame rates is rather impressive.  It is nice to know that you don&#39;t always  need to have a &#036;500 video card to play these games, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br /><br /><b>Performance:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><span style='font-size:13pt;line-height:100%'><b>Price/Warranty:</b></span><br /><br />The Sapphire Radeon X1300 is available online from &#036;95 in OEM form and &#036;97 in a retail box. For a mainstream card this is a reasonable price to pay for a card that will still enable you to play all the new games.  <br /><br />Sapphire offers a two year warranty on their products with tech support offered through their website and by phone.  RMA service is available after tech support has been used.<br /><br /><b>Price and Warranty:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><span style='font-size:13pt;line-height:100%'><b>Conclusion:</b></span><br /><br />After running the Sapphire Radeon X1300 through a few games and benchmarks I am happy with the performance of the card.  It is not going to give you that advantage in Battlefield 2 over the guy running an X1800 or a 7800 but it will give you a playable frame rate at a reasonable resolution. That is what people in the mainstream market are looking for; reasonable performance at a reasonable price.<br /><br /><b>Pros:</b><br />- Silent (Passive Cooling)<br />- Reasonable Performance<br />- Dual Monitor Support<br />- Inexpensive<br /><br /><b>Cons:</b><br />- Passive Cooling<br />- Single DVI Output<br /><br /><i>Specifications and Features:</i> 4/5<br /><i>Overview:</i> 4/5<br /><i>Performance:</i> 4/5<br /><i>Price and Warranty:</i> 4/5<br /><b>Overall: 16/20</b><br /><br />We would like to thank Sapphire for sending us this video card for review.

  You know what sucks?  Saphire has a bundle of what? 4-5 apps with this card, which is considered the low end card for this generation for ATI chips, and I got the 1800XL, 256RAM which is the second to highest card, and not one single app came with it.<br /><br />Serves me right.

  Its pretty cool for what it is. Definitly not a gamers card though. Unless you play older games. My onboard graphics 6150 is probably about in the same range as this card which is really good for media but limited in games. My geforce can play fear at medium settings though lol. I though fear was supposed to be a graphically demanding title. I guess not. Black and white 2 lags so bad you can&#39;t even play it. Not too shabby for 2 pixel pipelines 470 core and 128mb shared memory. when my 7800gt gets here I know it&#39;ll eat though b and w 2.
