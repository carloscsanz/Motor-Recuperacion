(1) Added automatically generated vocabulary help
to Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor, yielding
<i>the first intelligent tutoring system
with performance anywhere close to expert human tutoring,</i>
when its performance 
on word comprehension gains for third graders
proved comparable to that of human tutors.
<br>
(2) Founded NASA's Clarissa project, to help astronauts by talking them through procedures. 
When tested on the International Space Station, Clarissa became 
<i>the first dialog system in outer space</i>.
<br>
(3) Designed and implemented algorithms extending Rochester's TRIPS system, 
aimed at <i>enabling
computers to understand spoken language incrementally, 
as people do,</i>
as the utterance unfolds.
<br>



<H3>Research Overview</h3>

My research is in natural language processing
and computer-assisted learning.  

Within natural language processing
I have a particular interest in dialogue systems. 
A dialogue system is a computational device or agent 
that (a) engages in interaction with other human and/or computer participant(s); 
(b) uses human language in some form such as speech, text, or sign; 
and (c) typically engages in such interaction across multiple turns or sentences. 
The field of dialogue systems draws on disciplines 
such as computer science, linguistics, and psychology 
to study the research, development, deployment, and evaluation of such systems.

<p>
Within computer-assisted learning 
I have engaged in research and development
of computer-assisted learning environments
for areas as diverse as children learning to read
and astronauts practicing and performing procedures in space.
</p>

<p>
I also have a professional interest
in experimental methods for interactive systems.
I have conducted experiments and systematic analysis on many varied dialog systems,
using techniques from statistics and social science.  
I have also developed and co-developed
several novel techniques for experiments in interactive systems. Examples include
(a) embedded experiments for fine-grained evaluation of student learning &amp; 
analysis of interactive systems; (b) mining human-human dialogs for alternate phrasings
in order to enrich human-computer dialog; and (c) system-user-expert dialogs
for expanding the domain of expertise of an existing interactive system.
</p>


<h3>Examples of Research and Development</h3>

<p>
<i>Fruit Carts</i>. 2003-2007. <br>
    I established and collected a corpus of recorded human-human dialogs in an object movement and placement task (Fruit Carts). I have also developed and contributed to architectures, algorithms, and software systems for incremental understanding of human speech. 
In the Fruit Carts domain we are looking at how people describe visual objects when putting together a graphical document.  For example, we are examining the relationship between the difficulty of describing a property of an object (such as the angle of rotation) and the language strategies people adopt when forming descriptions and commands about that property.  We have been able to show that as users continued to engage in the task, there were systemic shifts in the type of language they used.  This type of language change might prove useful for tracking task mastery in a dialog system for computer-assisted learning.<br>
I then began working on parsing techniques, system architectures, and semantic representations to allow the system to begin actions while the user's utterance is still unfolding. For example, in the Fruit Carts domain, assume the user said "First move a large square with a diamond on the corner into Central Park right on top of the flag." By the time the word with has been recognized, we can hypothesize that a large square with some decoration on it (i.e. not a plain square) is called for, and begin whatever steps are necessary to select one of the large squares. By the time the word right has been recognized, we know that we are moving the large square into Central Park, even if we don't know exactly where, and so we can begin the movement - adjusting the exact target later after the exact location has been given.

<p>
<i>CALO - A cognitive assistant that learns and organizes. </i> 2003-2006.
<br>
CALO is a large, multi-site project aimed at developing a personal assistant that can adapt to its users and learn new skills. Working on the spoken dialog subproject, I have helped to design, collect, and analyze human-human dialogs in the target domain of computer purchasing. <br>
<small>with James Allen (faculty supervisor), George Ferguson, and Mary Swift at Rochester; Lucian Galescu and Nate Chambers at IHMC; Amanda Stent at Stony Brook. 
</small> 
</p>

<p>
<i>TRIPS - Rochester's domain-independent dialog systems framework. </i> 2003-present.
<br>
I have used TRIPS to study continuous understanding and also in the CALO project. Work on continuous understanding
is also being folded back into the TRIPS architecture. <br>
<small>with James Allen (faculty supervisor) and the TRIPS group at the University of Rochester and at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC).</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>Clarissa - a voice-enabled procedure browser for astronauts. </i>
2001-2003. <br>
I founded the Clarissa project, the CheckList And Robotics Intelligent Space Station Assistant.
Clarissa talks astronauts through complex written procedures.
Clarissa was tested on board the International Space Station in 2005 and is the first spoken dialog system used in outer space.<br>
<small>
with John Dowding, Beth Ann Hockey, Jim Hieronymus, Barney Pell, and Manny Rayner at NASA Ames;
astronaut corps and engineering personnel at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>WITAS - a dialog interface to a (simulated) robotic helicopter. </i>
2002-2003. <br>
We developed ways to add just-in-time help to a task-oriented dialog system in order to help the user learn what kinds of commands the system could recognize.  The help came along with an example sentence using some of the words that the user had used in the previous (incorrectly specified) command.  For example, if the user said "Follow that road" but the (simulated) helicopter was not capable of following roads, it might say in response "I heard you say 'follow that road', but I don't understand 'follow' when used with 'that road'.  You could say something like 'Follow the red truck'."  <br>
<small>with Oliver Lemon, Liz Bratt, and Stanley Peters at Stanford University; Ellen Campana and Beth Ann Hockey at NASA Ames.</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>Mobile Agents: human-robot collaboration. </i> 2002. <br>
Mobile Agents focuses particularly on large-scale, complex collaborative tasks, such as geological surveys in Mars analogue environments.  I assisted with the spoken dialog systems component of the field test at Meteor Crater in Arizona. <br><small>with William Clancy, John Dowding, and Maarten Sierhuis, all at NASA Ames.</small>
</p>

<p>
<i>Affective Learning Companion - a software agent to monitor &amp; respond to students' emotions. </i> 2001-2002. <br>
We designed and conducted experiments adding human-supplied emotional scaffolding to a pre-existing tutoring system, the Reading Tutor.  
Main result: Adding emotional scaffolding increased persistence, how long children chose to continue using the system; boys showed a 100 percent increase
in persistence, while girls read all the way to the end of the session 
in either condition.<br> 
<small>with Rosalind Picard (faculty sponsor), Barry Kort, and Rob Reilly at MIT; Jack Mostow at Carnegie Mellon.</small> 
</p>

<p>
<i>Project LISTEN: a Reading Tutor that uses speech recognition to help children learn to read. </i> 1996-2001. <br>
The Reading Tutor displays a document one sentence at a time, listening to the child read out load, and giving help when needed and praise when warranted.
In five years as the principal graduate student on Project LISTEN, I worked on nearly every aspect of developing, evaluating, and improving an intelligent tutoring system that uses spoken dialog to interact with its students, such as: review of relevant educational and psychological literature, distillation of good tutoring practice into automated behaviors, software development, experiment design and analysis,
and publication &amp; presentation of research results. <br>
<small>
with Jack Mostow (advisor) and the Project LISTEN group at Carnegie Mellon.
</small>

<p>
<i>Acoustic training for children's speech recognition. </i> 1997-1998.<br>
I devised heuristics to automatically select children's speech, collected during ordinary Reading Tutor use, that was likely to contain accurately transcribed sections.
We then trained the Whisper speech recognizer on this automatically collected, automatically transcribed data, and showed improvements in recognition performance over baseline acoustic training. 
<small> with Li Xiang and X.D. Huang (supervisors) at Microsoft;
Jack Mostow at Carnegie Mellon. </small><br>
<br>
</p>

<p><i>Information retrieval and organization.</i> 1994-1995. <br>
Prior to graduate school, I attended information retrieval group meetings at Cornell University, and worked briefly on optical character recognition for computer science technical reports.
<small>with Gerard Salton and Claire Cardie at Cornell University.</small><br>
As an undergraduate I developed a computer program to help users specify better search terms by engaging in a clarification dialogue about the meaning of their search terms. This opportunity to engage in research as an undergraduate was a gateway experience to graduate school and later research, and I plan to incorporate similar experiences for undergraduates into my own teaching.
