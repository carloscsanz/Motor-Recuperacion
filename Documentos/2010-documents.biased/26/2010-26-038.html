			<p>I recently found myself looking for a new graphics card.  Many moons ago I decided never to darken ATIs door again and have happily lived in the land of NVidia.  The card I was after was an XFX GTX 280 TripleX for &#163;350ish.  It was out of stock everywhere.  Rumours began emerging about a fabled 290 version being imminently announced at the NVision conference.  I decided to wait.  As I waited I kept reading reviews and everything I read pointed towards the ATI 4870 X2 being the hottest card available for the same price.  I eventually caved and decided to go with the Club 3D 4870 X2 and two days later it arrived.</p>
<a id="more127" name="more127"></a><p class="bMore">Follow up:</p>
<p>The first steps I took were to download the latest ATI Catalyst drivers (v8.8) and then uninstall the NVidia drivers.  I then rebooted into safemode and ran Driver Cleaner Pro (the free version) to remove any remnants of the NVidia installation.  Then I shut down, switched the cards and booted back up.  I cancelled the Windows "New Hardware Detected" boxes and started the Catalyst installation.  About 20% in the screen went blank, the monitor hadn't switched off or gone to sleep, it was just that the screen was black.  I thought this was due to me possibly plugging it into the wrong DVI socket so I tried the other one.  That did send the monitor to sleep so I switched it back.  Note that in a single monitor setup you should use the socket nearest to the motherboard.  I decided to leave it and wait till the hard drive activity had been silent for a while, about 10 minutes.  Then I just did a cold shut down and boot up.  Prior to that I couldn't get anything to trigger the display.  As soon as it started booting up again everything was fine.</p>

<p>Back into Windows and post login I right clicked the desktop and chose the "Catalyst&#8482; Control Center" context menu option.  I remember hating the Catalyst panel back in the day, this time it uses the default Windows style which is much better than ATIs crap attempts at an interface.  You can skip most of it but remember to set the interface to Advanced mode via the bottom left button.  The two important parts are "Displays Manager" from which you can set your resolution, color depth and refresh rate.  The other part, the one you'll be dicking with alot is the 3D section.  That's broken into 8 sub sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Settings</strong> should be ticked to "Custom Settings".</li>
<li><strong>Mipmap Detail</strong> Level should be set to max quality.</li>
<li><strong>More Settings</strong> can be ignored since the defaults seem fine.</li>
<li>There's an <strong>All Settings</strong> section which just lets you quickly access the other 3D sections from a single panel.</li>
<li>Now we get to the 4 sub categories that you'll be tinkering with alot.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong> lets you pick from "Use application settings" all the way up to 16X as well as picking from Box, Narrow-Tent, Wide-Tent and Edge Detect which in turn can boost it up to 32X.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Anti-Aliasing</strong> only seems to take effect when AA is not set to "Use application settings".  In the little demo window it looks great although I've yet to actually see it make any difference in a game.</li>
<li><strong>Anisotropic Filtering</strong> lets you pick from "Use application setting" up to 16X.</li>
<li><strong>Catalyst&#8482; A.I</strong> is a bit of a mystery.  The docs imply that ATI have added a slew of custom tweaks for various games which are all bundled under the A.I label.  No specifics are given.  You have three options here; Disabled, Standard or Advanced.  I found that my 3DMark score and ingame benchmarks were alot lower with it disabled.  I read a few forum posts that indicated that when disabled only the first GPU would be used.  I have this set to Advanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other part you'll frequently use is the top menus "Profiles" popup.  This lets you store different setting configurations as profiles.  Why would you use this?  Well certain games behave better with different settings.  An easy way to handle this is to setup the Control Center for GameX and then store that as a profile called GameX.  Then when you come to play GameY do the same for that.  Then before you play GameX you can just pick it from the profile dropdown (or from the right click menu if you have the ATI taskbar icon enabled) to quickly switch to GameXs preferred settings.  This is pretty standard stuff which you could also do with the NVidia panel.  Personally I never really bothered doing this with my XFX 8800 GT Alpha Dog TripleX card since everything just seemed to run sweet with how I'd configured it's default state.  Games seem <strong>ALOT</strong> more finicky with regards to the ATI card.</p>

<p>Another reason to use profiles is because the settings keep returning to default when you bring your system out of "Sleep Mode".  Definitely a pain but so far I've always remembered to pick my BF2142 profile when I need it.</p>

<p>The games I currently play are "World In Conflict", "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance" and "Battlefield 2142".  All of them are smoother with the Catalyst A.I setting enabled.  Forged Alliance has a decent built in benchmark.  With the Catalyst A.I disabled it scores a render mark of 5210.  With it enabled on Advanced I get 8052.  I can't tell a difference between Standard and Advanced so I've left it on Advanced because, well it's Advanced!  In all three games I have the resolution set to 1920x1200 to match my desktop and all ingame settings are set to max.  WIC has a DX10 mode which I enabled.</p>

<p>All three games work fine with AF set to 16X so across my three profiles that's what it's set to.</p>

<p>Having AA set to anything except "Use application settings" totally breaks Forged Alliance.  All the water effects become massively blocky.  Shorelines of islands from a zoomed out distance become huge bright glows to the point that you can't see any units on them.  Total shambles.  The awe-inspiring nuke effects are totally broken.  You can see the mushroom cloud of distant nukes but close up ones don't appear at all.  Even when AA is set to "Use application settings" close up nukes just appear as a firey orb lifting off the ground.  Very disapointing stuff.  Haven't found a way to fix that nuke effect at all yet.</p>

<p>In Battlefield 2142 having AA set to anything except "Use application settings" seems to simply disable AA altogether.  I did a bit of a custom tweak with BF2142.  Inside the <em>C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\Documents\Battlefield 2142\Profiles\0001\Video.con</em> file I changed <em>VideoSettings.setAntialiasing 4Samples</em> to <em>VideoSettings.setAntialiasing 8Samples</em> to enable ingame 8X AA.  It lets you do that via the ingame options panel but it jumps back to 4X.  That's the best you can hope for which in all honesty looks great.  I've left the "Adaptive Anti-Aliasing" set to max quality incase it actually does something although I can't see any difference.  At the very least it doesn't break anything.  One thing I have noticed is that the shock effect ingame is alot more intense.  I think it must of made my 8800 card struggle and I just assumed that was part of the effect.  Now it's smooth as a button but very disorientating which I guess it's supposed to be.</p>

<p>I'll list out what I consider to be the best settings for each game as and when I get time to properly test each of them out, always assume unless otherwise stated that the ingame options are set to max quality.</p>

<p><strong>Battlefield 2142</strong><br />
AA - Use application settings<br />
AAA - Max Quality<br />
AF - 16X<br />
Catalyst A.I - Advanced<br />
Mipmap Detail Level - Max Quality</p>

<p><strong>Max Payne</strong><br />
AA - 16X: Filter Wide-tent<br />
AAA - Max Quality<br />
AF - 16X<br />
Catalyst A.I - Advanced<br />
Mipmap Detail Level - Max Quality<br />
When the pre-game popup appears make sure to pick "options" and then disable in-game AA.  If you don't do this then all you see after the intro movie is a black screen.<br />
If you have a Creative soundcard then be sure to install setup <a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/alchemy/default.aspx">Creative Alchemy</a> as it re-enables all of the sounds and music in Vista.</p>

<p><strong>Call Of Duty 4</strong><br />
AA - 16X - Narrow Tent<br />
AAA - Max Quality<br />
AF - 16X<br />
Catalyst A.I - Advanced<br />
Mipmap Detail Level - Max Quality<br />
In-game turn all graphical options to their maxiumums except AA which should be disabled.  Using Narrow-Tent in the Catalyst AA panel gives you 24X AA in-game and runs smoothly.  Going up to Wide-Tent gives you 32X AA but the game becomes quite jerky.  Dropping down to Box with 16X AA means it runs a wee bit smoother than 24X although the difference is hardly noticable.</p>		</div>
