        you don&#39;t have Microsoft Word</h3><br>

        <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a PC at work, you probably
        use Microsoft Office. If you occasionally want to do office
        work at home, you probably think you need Microsoft Office
        at home, too.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#39;s not true. You don&#39;t
        need to have Microsoft Office on your home PC.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I&#39;ll tell you how you can
        work with Microsoft Office documents at home without
        needing Microsoft Office itself. You&#39;ll find out how
        you can do this even if you don&#39;t even have Windows --
        if, for example, you have an Apple Macintosh or a computer
        running Linux. (Macs and Linux PCs are designed to work
        better than Windows does, and this means they use different
        basic software.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Office handles word processing
        and a lot of other jobs. If you don&#39;t already use
        Microsoft Office, don&#39;t assume that this article is an
        endorsement of it. I&#39;m not suggesting that you go out
        and buy it just because a lot of other people use it.
        (There are other office software suites. Corel makes a good
        one that costs quite a bit and Sun makes a good one
        that&#39;s free. I&#39;ll talk more about them another
        time.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you already use it, you probably
        know already that Microsoft Office includes some important
        programs. It has Microsoft Word, the most common word
        processor for Windows PCs; PowerPoint, a program for
        showing slides on the screen; Excel, a program that
        compares numbers for you; Access, a program that gives you
        a way to store and sort information, and Outlook, an e-mail
        program. (The version of Outlook that comes with Microsoft
        Office is vastly more powerful than Outlook Express, the
        free e-mail program that Microsoft forces ISP&#39;s to give
        you when you sign up for an Internet account.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I&#39;ll concentrate on how
        you can work on Microsoft Word documents at home even if
        you don&#39;t have Microsoft Word or don&#39;t have Windows
        itself on your home computer.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This next part is easy. All you have to
        do is use the &quot;Save As&quot; menu -- the one under the
        &quot;File&quot; menu in Microsoft Word -- to save the
        document in a form your home software can handle.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most basic form is &quot;text.&quot;
        If you save your document as text, you&#39;ll be able to
        open it and work on it no matter what kind of computer you
        have. &quot;Text&quot; stands for words, numbers and
        punctuation that have nothing added. There are differences
        in the way various programs deal with text, so don&#39;t be
        surprised if you have to manually remove hidden line-ending
        codes or if your nicely formatted document turns into one
        long paragraph. (Just face it. There&#39;s not much you can
        do.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a much better method if you
        have a modern version of Windows -- Windows 95, Windows 98
        or Windows 2000 -- but don&#39;t have Microsoft Word. You
        can use the junior version of Word that Microsoft includes
        in every copy of Windows.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s called WordPad. The launch icon
        for WordPad is in the Start Menu under Accessories. Look
        for it before you do anything else, because for reasons
        I&#39;ve never understood Microsoft made WordPad optional,
        and that means your own Windows PC might not have it
        installed. (Microsoft might have been trying to save you
        some disk space -- a megabyte or so, probably. That&#39;s a
        savings of 1/80th of 1 percent of an 8-gigabyte drive.
        Thanks, Microsoft.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&#39;t see it in the Start
        Menu, you need to get out your Windows installation CD and
        install WordPad. Open the Control Panel and choose
        &quot;Add/Remove Programs.&quot; Then choose &quot;Windows
        Setup.&quot; Double click &quot;Accessories.&quot; Scroll
        to the bottom of the list and make sure &quot;WordPad&quot;
        is checked, then click &quot;OK&quot; and follow the
        instructions. If you have trouble at this point, complain
        to the company that sold you the computer; they did you a
        disservice by leaving WordPad out.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft left a few important functions
        out of WordPad -- it doesn&#39;t have a spell checker,
        won&#39;t show newspaper-style columns and has trouble with
        margins -- but it&#39;s fine for what it is, a free word
        processor that can display huge documents easily. Like the
        most basic text editors, WordPad can display and allow you
        to change text documents (the ones with &quot;txt&quot; at
        the end of their names). It also can work with
        &quot;RTF&quot; documents (&quot;rich text format&quot;
        files).<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the best part of WordPad is the way
        it works with Microsoft Word documents -- as long as you
        remember one VERY important thing: You have to use
        &quot;Save As&quot; in Microsoft Word to save a copy of the
        document in Word 6 format. Microsoft also calls this
        &quot;Word for Windows 6.0.&quot;<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The guy down the hall might try to tell
        you that you can also save the document as RTF if
        you&#39;re using Word 97 or Word 2000. But don&#39;t do it
        that way. The Word 6 document format is always better than
        RTF when you are working with Microsoft Word at the office
        and WordPad at home.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&#39;s the sequence. You want to
        work on the &quot;Widgets Sales Meeting Report&quot;
        document at home. Right now it&#39;s in Word 97 format.
        Open it in Word 97 and choose &quot;Save As&quot; in the
        &quot;File&quot; menu. Choose &quot;Word 6.0/95&quot; in
        the drop-down list of file types. Finish saving the
        document, then take (or send) THAT version home.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, run WordPad and open the
        document. Make your changes and save it as a &quot;Word for
        Windows 6.0&quot; document if WordPad asks you. (It might
        choose that format by itself.)<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring (or send) the document back to the
        office. Word 97 will know how to open the document just
        fine. Use &quot;Save As&quot; and save it as a Word 97
        document.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are two cautions before you try
        this out yourself.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, when you &quot;Save As,&quot;
        always use a different name for the document so that
        you&#39;ll create a copy. Then, when you send or carry the
        document back to the office you&#39;ll still have the
        original. Second, if you are carting the document back and
        forth on a floppy disk, don&#39;t work on the document
        while it&#39;s on the floppy disk. Windows has an annoying
        bug that makes it spin the floppy drive at odd times, and
        this bug is nourished every time you work on a file on a
        floppy disk. Copy the file to your hard drive before you
        work on it.</span><br>
