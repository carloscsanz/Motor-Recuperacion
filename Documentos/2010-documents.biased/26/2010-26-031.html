<CENTER><H2>New Warmth For Wells Goal</H2></CENTER>

<BIG><FONT COLOR="#FF0080"><BIG><BIG>B</BIG></BIG>ecause there can't be a pancake breakfast fund-raiser at the Dutch Mill</FONT></BIG> for this fund any more, this appeal must reach you directly.
Jeanne McCord reports that February 9 - 15 was the Warmth For Wells focus drive.  The goal is to raise $5,000 to assist Wells County folks with their heating bills.    This is a local council project of the Wells County office of Community and Family Services.<P>
This is the fourth year for this effort to raise funds for utility emergencies.  The needs are escalating because of the recent fires at two businesses.  Churches are doing all they can.  It will really help Jeanne's good cause if we all pitch in on this small, reasonable goal of $5,000.  Let's all be able to say we had a part in keeping our community cozy.  <P>

<CENTER><H2>Sterling Casting</H2></CENTER>

<BIG><BIG>N</BIG></BIG>ICE NEWS: The Union at Sterling Casting sponsored a food bank on Saturday, January 24,  at the Camelot reception hall in Vera Cruz. It was for the affected employees of Pretzels Inc. and the Dutch Mill.  This is the Sterling workers way to try to pay back all the community did for them when Sterling had its financial woes.  It is wonderful that the company is back in business!<P>
<SMALL>One of my friends with five little daughters took her youngest with her to this food bank.  The daughter told her mom "this is the most fun I ever had.  Will you take me again?"  Think about that.  These moms aren't working to "get out of the house."<P>

<CENTER><H2>Food Bank's 13th Annual  Matching Gift -- <BR>
This goal has been met!!!</H2></CENTER>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0080"><BIG><BIG>A</BIG></BIG>lthough this goal has been met, with the two fires and O'Boise, there is an ongoing need.</B></FONT><P>
Once again, an anonymous donor  offered <B>up to $10,000 </B> to the food bank, contingent upon our donating an equal amount before December 25th, 1997.  This is the 13th year for this mystery man to make this offer.<P>

The food bank has especially urgent needs this season.  Mick and Connie Cupp explained that although employment is high, wages are insufficient for many families to pay heating bill and also buy food.  (This was written before the fires.)

Jim Barbieri writes in the <A HREF="http://www.parlorcity.com/secop/newsban.html">Bluffton News-Banner</A> that "amounts of any size, like Christmas joy, are welcome."

<CENTER><H2>Outdoor Decorating Awards</H2></CENTER>

<BIG><BIG>T</BIG></BIG>he <A HREF="http://www.parlorcity.com/secop/newsban.html">Bluffton  News Banner</A> announced that <B>Dr. and Mrs. John (Sandy) Burry</B> won the $300.00 first prize in the outdoor decorating contest, and then generously donated that money to the <A HREF="http://our.tentativetimes.net/city/lydia.html">Lydia Murray liver-transplant</A> fund!<P>

View the winner at <B>309 Willowbrook Trail</B>.  You will have no trouble spotting it from afar.  Words fail me.<P>

Second prize went to <B>Kermit and Lillian George</B> at <B>852 Parkway Drive</B>.  Traditional and effective shapes with lights: a huge wreath and on each shutter, an outline of a  lighted Christmas tree.<P> 
 
Third prize was claimed by <B>Joel and Patty Makowski</B> at <B>1100 River Road</B>.  Tiny white lights on all the trees and greenery, in abundance!<P>

The Clark Griswold Award  (for the most lighting in combination with Christmas decorations) went to <B>the Allen Penn home</B> at <B>311 East Cherry Street</B>.  I can see it from my window, and it is stunning.  Large colored bulbs on the incredible evergreen in the front yard, with many more lights on everything that didn't move.  They make good use of a single color per decoration, and their neighbors, instead of being intimidated, joined right in, making a lane of beauty.<P>

Thanks to the city of Bluffton and the Bluffton Utilities for sponsoring this cheerful contest.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Lt. Laurel Kelly, WW II</H3></CENTER>

<BIG><BIG>I</BIG></BIG>n case you aren't reading this in Bluffton, something interesting has been happening here about the Kelly family.  (Local residents are up to speed on this one.)<P>

Our newspaper published  this <A HREF="http://www.cuneo.alpcom.it/italiano/bacheca/aviation/aviation.html">address for the website</A> of an Italian man who rescued Lt. Kelly when his plane crashed in Italy in World War II.  The researchers making the site are Italiams Unia Gerardo and Sergio Costagli.<P> 

The email address for this site is <A HREF="unia.costagli@cuneo.alpcom.it">unia.costagli@cuneo.alpcom.it</A> although I did not hear back when I wrote in English.<P>

 Even his sons Dave and Steve were unaware of the details of his rescue by Italian Partisans who saved his life.  His widow  Doris resides here too, and is  equally glad to learn these details.  Dave Kelly <A HREF="mailto:dkel@fortwayne.infi.net">dkel@fortwayne.infi.net</A> has email. I need someone to translate it from the Italian **if** we  get permission to mirror it.  Volunteers??  Email Sandra at <A HREF="mailto:editor@tentativetimes.net">editor@tentativetimes.net</A><P>

The whole story is heartwarming.  I just don't want to short you on it.  I want you to learn all about it, not just the little bit I would fit in here.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Tom Ayers Benefit</H3></CENTER>
<BIG><BIG>A</BIG></BIG>n all-out effort of the area raised $18,000.00 for the Tom Ayers family, at the benefit on May 17th.  Tom has a rare form of leukemia (mantle cell lymphoma) which  is now treatable with a bone marrow transplant.  The trouble is that the insurance company says the treatment is experimental and won't pay for it.    The good news is that Tom has already had the operation,  on his own, donating his own marrow.  <P>
The <A HREF="mailto:newsbanner@parlorcity.com">Bluffton News-Banner</A> further explained that the bone marrow treatment appears to work, and has been in use for a year now.  The insurance company says it has to wait three years before they are convinced it is worth paying for.   It won't pay for any before that time.  <P>
The Ayers children, by the way, are 2, 4, 8 and 12 years old.  Wife Sandy works for attorney Ned Carnall.<P>
<BIG><BIG>U</BIG></BIG>pdate: Tom's brother Joe told me that the operation was completely successful and Tom is a new man now.  8^}<P>

<CENTER><H3>Claude Decker Day Proclaimed</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Purdue and Bluffton High School Alum Is Feted</H3></CENTER>
<BIG><BIG>M</BIG></BIG>ay 16, 1997, was declared Claude Decker Day at City Hall.  There was a nice reception during the daytime when everyone who knew about it could come thank Mr. Decker for all he has done for our city.  The event also celebrated Mr. Decker's 80th birthday (on May 18).   Fellow philanthropist Amos Gerber was among the celebrants.  <P>

Among the Deckers' contributions are the entire 15 acres of the jail property, the land for the south arm of the West Side Corridor (with Hugh Baker) for our new bridge across the Wabash River, (they are about ready to pour the horizontal concrete!) and the Bluffton-Decker Industrial Park land and infrastructure.  <P>

Claude Decker Day would also have been the Decker's anniversary.  The Deckers pioneered the Wells County Foundation program.  <P>

<HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN=CENTER>
<B><BIG><BIG>D</BIG></BIG>ick Sark</B> was surprised by a retirement party  at the jail.  He had been in law enforcement for over 30 years.  When he joined the sheriff's department in 1972, there were three employees:  one sheriff and two deputies.  He became the third deputy.  Now the staff is the  sheriff, nine deputies and two detectives.  Either we are getting more lawless around here, or someone is not putting up with what they used to tolerate!  Dick is going to concentrate on his concession business, fly model airplanes and enjoy his computer skills.  Visit <A HREF="http://www.parlorcity.com/dsark/">Dick Sark's homepage</A>!<BR>
Dick's replacement is Doug Masterson.<P>
