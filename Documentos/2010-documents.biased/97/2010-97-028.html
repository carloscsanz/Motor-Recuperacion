<h2 id="ExecSummary">A. Executive Summary</h2>

<p>When the World Wide Web was proposed a decade ago it was envisioned not
only as a medium for human communication but also one of machine
communication. The second half of that hope is as yet unrealized, with the
frustrating result that vast amounts of data available to the human enquirer
cannot practically be analysed and combined by machine. At the outset of the
Web, the field of hypertext was one which had shown much initial promise but
little wide scale deployment. Its conversion to a global scalable system was
to change that. In the meantime, much work in knowledge representation (KR) --
in ontology, interchange languages, and agent infrastructure -- has
demonstrated the viability of KR as a basis for agent interaction while
simultaneously highlighting the importance of support for heterogeneity and
decentralization. At present, the field of knowledge representation has shown
much initial promise but little truly widespread deployment.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web concept is to do for data what HTML did for textual
information systems: to provide sufficient flexibility to be able to represent
all databases, and logic rules to link them together to great added value. The
first steps in this direction were taken by the World-Wide Web Consortium (<a
href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>) in defining <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a> [Lassila
et al. 1999], a simple language for expressing relationships in triples where
any of the triple can be a first class web object. This basis has the
decentralized property necessary for growth. The proposed project is to
utilize and demonstrate the great power of adding, on top of the RDF model
(modified as necessary) the power of KR systems. We refer to this augmented
language as the Semantic Web Logic Language, or SWeLL.</p>

<p>We propose to build on the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML)
infrastructure to provide precisely such an interchange between two or more
rather different kinds of applications. The first of these involves structured
information manipulations required to maintain the ongoing activities of an
organization such as the W3C, including access control, collaborative
development, and meeting management. In the second, we will address the
informal and often heuristic processes involved in document management in a
personalized information environment. Integrated into both environments will
be tools to enable authors to control terms under which personal or sensitive
information is used by others, a critical feature to encourage sharing of
semantic content.</p>

<p>Optionally, we will also explore applications to spoken language interfaced
discourse systems, automation and automated application construction, and
intentional naming of networked resources (by function rather than by a fixed
naming scheme). By using the uniform structure of the Semantic Web in each of
these applications, we will demonstrate the ability of this technology to
build bridges between heterogeneous components and to provide next-generation
information interchange.</p>

<p>The Internet being a medium whose level of inherent security is very low,
it is expected that digital signature technology will be essential in
verifying the steps involved in most discussions. Indeed, the fundamental
rules controlling input to a system will not simply be logic, but will combine
semantics with the security of digital signature. The project's access control
system will employ digital signature.  We expect to incorporate digital
signature in a way consistent with industry work on digital signature for
Extensible Markup Language (XML) [Eastlake].</p>

<p>The project will involve the creation of interoperating systems to
prototype the Semantic Web ideas. These will necessarily include simple tools
for authoring, browsing, and manipulating the language underlying these
applications, as well as the systems themselves.</p>

<p>The work will be deployed along three axes: by adoption by W3C staff
internally and by partners such as LCS Oxygen and other DAML participants; by
dissemination through and codevelopment with the Open Source community, and
when appropriate, by facilitation of consensus around interoperable standards
for the Semantic Web using the W3C processs.</p>


<h2 id="Innovative">B. Innovative Claims and Program Vision</h2>

<p>This project is a key move in the transition to a <em>Semantic Web</em>
software and information environment, in which complex applications can
interoperate by exchanging information with a basis in high level logic and
well-defined meaning. The project is constructed from software modules which,
while performing quite dissimilar functions, exchange information using the
languages of the Semantic Web, including the DARPA Agent Markup Language
(DAML). The project will form a practical testbed of these ideas. If
successful, it will also provide a model to lead both military and commercial
development in the future, generating a critical mass of existing systems on
the Semantic Web to trigger wide growth of the technology.</p>

<p>We are particularly concerned with information management and information
flow on the Semantic Web. Two contrasting subsystems are proposed as the
essential basis of our development, with a number of optional projects. One
system is an organizational management system which implements the social and
managerial processes -- the "social machines" of an organization, the World
Wide Wide Consortium (W3C). This system uses well-defined logical algorithms
to implement such things as resource management (meeting planning, calendars,
etc.), secure web-site access control, and tools to enable individuals to
control use of personal information contributed to the Semantic Web.  The
W3C's "Live Early Adoption and Demonstration" policy of using its own
technology makes it a particularly appropriate testbed.</p>

<p>The other central system is a personal and group information system based
on our previous <a href="http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu"><em>Haystack</em></a>
work. Haystack [Adar et al.]  is a personal information environment:  It
stores a particular individual's documents and other on-line information,
together with automatically generated annotations concerning the context in
which the information is encountered, providing content- and context-based
retrieval.  Haystack also uses heuristic algorithms to analyze personal
activity to find patterns and relevant resources within a user's information
environment, making it an interesting contrast to the more deliberative W3C
systems. While the two systems differ on a scale from secure enforcement of
rigid policy to enhanced guesswork about relevant material, they share an
internal model for the storage of information which maps well onto the
XML-based Resource Description Framework (RDF) developed by W3C. This makes
these two systems excellent candidates for integration using Semantic Web
techniques. Using RDF to interchange raw data and higher level logic
languages to be developed within the DAML community for the exchange of
inference rules, the crucial step is to gain added value from interoperability
at the semantic level.</p>

<p>In the past, such interworking would have only operated at the level of raw
data. While the systems would have been able to share, for example, the fact
that a person was a member of a group, they would not have been able exchange
the reason why. To ask why is to ask for a justification -- a series of steps
by which the fact was derived. The Semantic Web Logic Language (SWeLL) -- part
of the DAML family -- will allow this justification to be passed between
systems.</p>

<p><img src="sw.png" alt="A diagram of the semantic web b" border="0"
align="bottom"></p>

<p>The World Wide Web currently links a heterogeneous distributed
decentralized set of systems. Some of these systems use relatively simple and
straightforward manipulation of well-characterized data, such as an access
control system. Others, such as search engines, use wildly heuristic
manipulations to reach less clearly justified but often extremely useful
conclusions. In order to achieve its potential, the Semantic Web must provide
a common interchange language bridging these diverse systems. Like HTML, the
Semantic Web language should be basic enough that it does not impose an undue
burden on the simplest web software systems, but powerful enough to allow more
sophisticated components to use it to advantage as well.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web, then, will serve as an interchange "bus" for on-line
data. In effect, it will allow any web software to read and manipulate data
published by any other web software.  SWeLL will enable this interchange. The
pairing of simple, predictable, reliable systems with complex, unpredictable,
heuristic systems is one of the novel possibilities opened by the Semantic
Web.  This combination of systems is new ground which this project will specifically explore.</p>

<p>In importing structured information into a heuristic system such as
Haystack, we are able to enhance the operation of the heuristic system. The
Haystack system currently looks at the contents of documents, and a user's
interactions with them, in order to determine things such as subjective
"quality" and relevance". Imagine now that all information available to the
user from the W3C administrative system is imported into Haystack. The
Haystack inference engines will be able to flow semantic links through the
social structure and be able to include concepts of W3C documents status. The
information space is much richer. When before two documents might have seemed
syntactically related, the versioning system might reveal that one was in fact
an earlier version of the other. The structured information imported from W3C
is also enhanced by being integrated into the semantic network of a haystack,
making it addressable through the heuristic retrieval machinery built into
Haystack.</p>

<p>In the other direction there are at least two interesting ways in which
heuristic systems can export information -- through the semantic web -- to
hard logical systems. In one case, a heuristic is used to find a solid
argument, which can then be directly accepted by the logic system (e.g., using
the proof verifier). In the other, a heuristic system (such as a search
engine) cannot logically justify its results, but has achieved such a level of
success that those results are authorized for input into an otherwise strictly
logical system as hard data. In this case, the accepting system is simply
taking the heuristic system's word for it, rather than analyzing the
justification further. Digital signature here plays a crucial role in ensuring
the validity of such assertions. Personal information management schemas will
create a trusted environment in which authors of semantic content will be
willing to open their metadata to other's haystacks.</p>


<h2 id="Components">C. Software Components Proposed</h2>

<p>The research goals set out in Section B require the design of
software components to enable users and their machines to interact with
metadata on the Semantic Web. These new Semantic Web tools will be designed
with an eye toward general application, but targeted initially toward the two
testbed environments of this project: Semantic Web-based W3C organizational
tools and Haystack interfaces with the Semantic Web.</p>

<h3><a name="Organizati">W3C Organizational Tools</a></h3>

<p>The W3C operation is distributed globally with over 380 Member
organizations. With over 50 active working groups including participants from
hundreds of member representatives, numerous documents in being edited by many
collaborators, active online publishing of these documents are various stages
of maturity, the W3C makes an ideal testbed for development of decentralized
Semantic Web tools. As the Web community at-large depends heavily on the
technical information presented at the W3C site, these tools will also be
tested by the pressures of the public Web.</p>

<p>We propose to build a suite of Semantic Web-powered tools to assist in the
management of and participation in the W3C's work.  The basic functions of the
tools will include:
<ul>
  <li>Semantic content authoring tools</li>
  <li>SWeLL-based proof generators</li>
  <li>SWeLL-based proof validators</li>
  <li>Access control: controlling access to documents on various parts of the
    W3C site</li>
  <li>Personal INformation Schema (PINS) controls: using DAML and SWeLL, users
    will be able to attach conditions to use and re-use of information they
    contribute to the Semantic Web</li>
</ul>

<p>Our plans to build organizational management tools with Semantic Web
components is illustrated by our proposed approach to access control.
Employees of W3C Member organizations are granted access to portions of the W3C Web
site that may differ from the access granted to non-Members. Today, W3C
webmasters maintain several databases to manage access permissions for all
members. Using Semantic Web tools, we wish to delegate to the Member company
primary contact and to the chairs of the working groups the authority to
authorize individuals to join restricted mail distribution lists, to publish
Web pages at specific locations on the W3C Web site, to register for meetings
and workshops, and to access materials on other parts of the Web site. This
delegation must be done by following a chain of assertions regarding the
resources being access controlled and the individuals whose access is being
authorized or verified. To enable this the software components required
include:
<ul>
  <li id="browser">A web browser or a http proxy modified to send proofs of
    access (these will likely be based on the Open Source W3C Amaya or Mozilla
    and W3C Jigsaw platforms);</li>
  <li id="simple">An application for generating access proofs in simple
    cases for that browser;</li>
  <li id="server">A web server modified to accept SWeLL access
  justifications;</li>
  <li id="generic">A generic SWeLL proof checker employed as access verifier
    by that server;</li>
  <li id="version">A version of that checker modified to include XML Digital
    Signature verification.</li>
  <li id="tool">A PINS tool for managing working group membership information
    while preserving social constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the access control system, we will use the Semantic Web
tools as building blocks to help bring functions such as document version
management, issue tracking, personal information management, and event
scheduling.</p>

<h3>Haystack</h3>

<p>The Haystack system supports the storage, organization, retrieval, and
(eventually) sharing of an individual's documents and other knowledge.
Haystack was designed with a rich data representation that is
quite similar to the RDF data model.  Haystack
already contains numerous tools that gather information about the user into
this data model, as well as tools for modifying, searching and navigating this
data model.  Much of the data within Haystack is generated by automated
services that "reason" about extant data in order to generate new data.</p>

<p>We will augment Haystack to import data from and export data to the
Semantic Web.  As numerous applications begin to make their information
available in the Semantic Web format, it becomes easy for Haystack to import
this information to augment its user's information space.  And because of the
similarity of Haystack's model to RDF, it is also easy for Haystack to export
its own information for access by other Semantic Web enabled systems.  This
requires two basic tools:
<ul>
  <li>A Semantic Web parser for Haystack</li>
  <li>A tool that exports Haystack data to the Semantic Web, providing URIs
    for internal Haystack objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Haystack is designed as a <em>personal</em> information repository; we
therefore expect and hope that over time each Haystack will develop a
specialized vocabulary of metadata tuned to its own user.  This makes
the exchange of information challenging, both between multiple Haystacks and
between Haystack and other tools that do not have knowledge of this
specialized metadata.  The Semantic Web will provide the mechanism for this
information exchange.  We propose the following components.
<ul>
  <li>A component that exports the "meaning" of a user's specialized metadata
    for use by other systems</li>
  <li>A component that imports Semantic Web assertions and uses them to
    convert external data to conform to the Haystack user's specialized
    metadata.</li>
  <li>A component that exports proofs explaining <em>why</em> a given piece of
    information is present in a Haystack, so that other visiting Haystacks can
    decide whether they too would like to believe that piece of
  information.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the Semantic Web will support the exchange of information from
different vocabularies, human assistance will be required to define those
vocabularies and the connections between them.  Users will need tools to
define their own metadata structures for others.  And they will need to
examine others' metadata structures in order to relate them to their own.  We
propose the following components.
<ul>
  <li>An authoring tool that will let users describe their metadata and the
    rules their Haystack uses to generate it.</li>
  <li>A browsing tool that lets users examine the Semantic Web information at
    another site and guide their Haystack in relating that information to
    their own metadata.</li>
</ul>

<h4>General Shared Components</h4>

<p>Haystack will also exploit the general purpose components being designed
for the Semantic Web.  We will specialize the following components for use in
Haystack.
<ul>
  <li>The proof constructor will be used to explain how certain Haystack
    information was generated.  This will require augmenting the proof system
    with fuzzy notions of relevance.</li>
  <li>The proof verifier will be used (essentially unchanged) to decide
    whether to make use of proofs generated by other systems</li>
  <li>The access control system described previously will be used to limit the
    sharing of Haystack's information to authorized individuals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal Information Management Preferences</h3>

<p>In order to encourage users to share semantic content, we will provide a
Personal Information management Schema (PINS) tool to enable users to attach
usage restrictions to information, especially personalized information, made
part of the Semantic Web.  The tools that enable users to interact with
Semantic Web content will be aware of these preferences and help users'
applications to follow the permissions attached to metadata by its original
creator.</p>

<h3>Full Oxygen Integration Option</h3>

<p>As an option, we propose to explore strategies for integrating the Semantic
Web tools developed in the early phase of this project with the LCS Oxygen
Project.  While Haystack, an Oxygen component, is already a leading part of
this DAML initiative, we propose to create links between this and other Oxygen
components including tools to take advantage of advanced work on speech,
automation, and networking.</p>

<p></p>


<h2 id="Description">D. Technical description</h2>

<p>The power and explosive growth of the World Wide Web is based on two very
simple concepts; a way of creating names for anything that is accessible on
the Internet and the one-way <em>navigational</em> link from a document to
such a nameable thing.  These navigational links direct the readers' attention
to other Internet resources, but they do not capture the author's reason for
having created the link.  To capture such a relationship, today's web authors
use natural language, making such information all but inaccessible to
automated processing.</p>

<p>Over time, a community builds up a shared vocabulary for the concepts with
which it works.  Separate communities that have similar experiences will have
common concepts but different vocabularies.  In the Semantic Web, we will use
the naming power of the World Wide Web to attach names to the concepts as used
by each community and we will have a new kind of link -- a link with meaning
-- that describes the relationships between the names used by one community
and the names used by another.  Thus, the Semantic Web will contain bridges
between these islands of local (community) vocabulary and will enable extended
information access across community boundaries.</p>

<p>An important feature provided by the Semantic Web is the ability to respond
to the query "What is the basis for that statement?"; to help a user to answer
the question "Do I believe that?", or alternatively, "How much risk is there
to my achieving my objectives if I act on the basis of that statement?".  The
language of the Semantic Web must thus be able to represent information
destined for automated processing. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a
existing industry language which will form the basis for this language, which
we refer to as SWeLL, the Semantic Web Logic Language. RDF is a flexible and
general language for the expression of assertions and allows the exchange of
raw facts between heterogeneous systems (see diagram).</p>

<h3>Example: Simple Search Made Sensible</h3>

<p>We provide an example illustrating how the Semantic Web permits bridges
between the vocabularies developed by independent communities.</p>

<p>Today, we might ask "What is bmw7's power?" and get no answer back because
BMW's web page gives the answer in German terminology. With the Semantic Web,
we might retrieve an answer based on heuristically driven classical logic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is bmw7's power?
    <ol>
      <li>search( bmw7, power, x ) yields a nil result</li>
      <li>search( bmw7, subclass, x ) yields x=beamer, car, thing</li>
      <li>search( beamer, power, x ) yields a nil result</li>
      <li>search( power, equivalent, x ) yields x=Macht</li>
      <li>search( bmw7, Macht, x ) yields x=160kw</li>
      <li>deduce( bmw7, power, 160kw )</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The bmw7's power is 160kw.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, of course, the Semantic Web allows us to investigate further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why?
    <p>Because power is the same as Macht and the catalog from BMW says the
    Macht of the bmw7 is 160kw.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, individual queries to the Semantic Web will be very specialized
circumscribed requests made by special-purpose applications. Want-to-buy
requests, invoices, web searches, and even check-writing are each examples of
such transactions. These Semantic Web applications do not rely on the full
power of SWeLL to make their requests. And, when processing these requests,
the fulfilling applications will likely use heuristics or restricted inference
rules in order to answer the requests. Inference engines typically have a
query language specially designed to constrain the question so that the answer
can be produced in a tractable fashion. This is how most systems, including
the components of this project, work. However, interchange between components
can be embedded in a sufficiently general language to ensure that virtually
any components have the potential to interoperate over the Semantic Web.</p>

<h3>Logic of Authority</h3>

<p>In practice -- in a distributed decentralized world -- some sources will be
more reliable (on some topics) than others and different sources may even
assert mutually contradictory information.  RDF is based on XML for which
digital signature standards are expected to emerge early in the life of this
project. XML Digital Signature will be used to provide an authentication
component in this project. SWeLL processors will generally be aware of the
source and authority for each piece of information. Information will be
processed differently as a function of trust in its source.</p>

<p>It is not enough for facts to be shared between different data systems, or
even for signed data to be shared. Several logic-based languages have been
used with some success as knowledge interchange languages (e.g. SHOE, KIF,
etc.). In these systems RDF-like facts are augmented with rules that combine
logical information with directives for effecting inference. Such directives
are not always exchangeable between different types of KR systems, but the
logical relationships must be expressible in SWeLL. For this, SWeLL extends
RDF by including negation and explicit quantification.</p>

<p>But to achieve its full potential, the Semantic Web must do more. The
Semantic Web is composed of heterogeneous systems. No real system can answer
every possible question about its data (i.e. none can compute the deductive
closure of its information). Different systems make different compromises,
affording different sets of inferences. For this reason, one application will
often be able to reach a particular conclusion when another does not.</p>

<p>In the general case, one piece of software will need to be able to explain
or justify to another why its assertions ought to be accepted. This allows an
untrusted system to effectively communicate information, by compellingly
justifying that information. The steps of such a justification amount to a
logical proof of the assertion, and the final key element of the Semantic Web
is a proof verification system that allows justifications and inferences to be
exchanged along with raw data. Thus, a heuristic of one system may posit a
relationship (such as that a person may access a web page) and succeed in
finding a logical justification for it. This can be conveyed to a very rigid
security system that could never have derived this relationship or its
justification on its own, but which can verify that the justification is
sound.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web works by allowing each individual system to maintain its
own language and characteristics. The access control system works with finite
sets of people, groups, and documents, and allows constrained expressions for
access control. Haystack uses a certain set of user-programmed rules rather
than a general inference engine. Prolog, SHOE, Algernon and KIF systems in
turn make different decisions regarding their inference languages, and so have
correspondingly different characteristics.</p>

<h3>Organizational Modeling: A Structured Application</h3>

<p>The W3C uses a mixture of database and web-based tools to provide
administrative support for day-to-day operations. Specific challenges include
balancing rapid response and autonomy of subgroups with general
accountability.  This challenge is heightened by having personnel distributed
geographically around the world. Concepts modeled by the systems include
people, W3C Member organizations, individuals, working groups and other groups
of various kinds, mailing lists, and documents. All documents involved in W3C
publicly visible or internal work are on the Web. The web servers allow access
to an individual web resource to be finely controlled without changing the URI
of that resource.</p>

<p>Currently, W3C is at a similar level of development to many organizations
in that applications are built as custom web access to databases. However,
data exists in a variety of formats and storage media from flat files to
relational databases.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of overlap among the W3C data systems, but this
shared conceptual space more often translates into redundancy than in useful
sharing of subsystems.  For example, the concept of group membership exists
independently in web access control, W3C membership management, mailing lists
administration, and meeting registration. In an ideal world group membership
would be delegated using a flexible trust system which would map the practical
nature of real-life trust relationships.</p>

<p>Our proposed system uses Semantic Web techniques to expose this
organizational data consistently. For example,</p>
<ol>
  <li>The W3C membership table is exposed at the W3C web site in RDF;</li>
  <li>The list of those authorized access though a member company may be
    delegated to a remote web site;</li>
  <li>The membership of a working group may be delegated to the chair;</li>
  <li>The access control of files is stored as metadata close to the file, and
    determined by the file owner;</li>
  <li>One or more annotation servers allow a third party to store information
    about items for which they have no write access;</li>
  <li>and so on</li>
</ol>

<p>In this context, we expect to demonstrate the operation of systems which
cross domains such as one or more of the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generic query engines will perform queries crossing domains;</li>
  <li>Validation may be performed of organizational invariants across
  domains;</li>
  <li>New application building may be done using generic tools;</li>
  <li>An access proof construction client will be able to use heuristics to find a justification
    for access, and the access control system will be able to validate its
    correctness;</li>
  <li>The heuristic models of haystack will be able to interoperate with the
    organizational management systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>The expectation is that during the life of the project, code will be
available for the validation of XML digital signatures. This will allow these
systems to check information strictly with regard to its source, and
particularly a validated signature.</p>

<h4>Example Scenario:<a name="401"></a>401: Oh Yeah? Prove you have
access!</h4>

<p>The Semantic Web will allow us to model social processes, making facts and
rules available for sharing between heterogeneous implementations of those
social processes. For example, consider access to the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C web site</a>.</p>

<p>A portion of the W3C web site is confidential to the W3C Membership.
Traditional web server facilities allow us to create a w3c-member group, issue
accounts that belong to that group, and limit access to certain paths within
the web site to that group.</p>

<p>But this is a poor model of the actual social process, and the W3C spends a
lot of administrative resources bridging the gap: the right to access the
member confidential portions of the W3C web site is actually granted to any
W3C Member representative, and each W3C Member organization has a
distinguished Advisory Committee Representative (AC Rep) who has the right to
appoint other representatives from his/her organization. We have extended the
traditional web server facilities to model groups within groups, but we have
not automated the various policies that AC Reps use to appoint
representatives; for example, the ACME AC Rep may say "do not grant anyone the
right to represent ACME to W3C without my explicit approval" while the Zebco
AC Rep says "everyone who can receive mail in the Zebco.com domain may act as
a Zebco representative to W3C." The W3C system administration team has to
remember and manually implement these policies. Even this is a simplification
of the overall confidentiality policy; W3C has other classes of individuals
such as invited experts, liaisons, and other exceptions.</p>

<p>In the Semantic Web we can represent the whole range of policies as logical
assertions using classical logic with quoting and some axioms about digital
signatures. We replace the fixed structure of groups and accounts in the web
server with a component that verifies assertions of the form</p>

<blockquote>
  Kwebmaster assures "hasAccess(Krequestor, pageID)"</blockquote>

<p>where</p>

<blockquote>
  K assures "S"</blockquote>

<p>means that the statement S was signed with K or can be deduced from
statements signed by K; i.e. we have the following axioms:</p>

<blockquote>
  (S=>T) => ((K assures "S") => (K assures "T"))<br>
  (K assures "S") /\ (K assures "T") => (K assures "S /\ T")</blockquote>

<p>Next, the W3C Director delegates appointment of member representatives to
AC Reps by publishing a signed assertion:</p>

<blockquote>
  Kdirector assures<br>
  "\forall org, Kacrep, Krep (ACRep(Kacrep, org)<br>
  /\ (Kacrep assures "memberRep(Krep, org)")<br>
  => memberRep(Krep, org)"</blockquote>

<p>And in the course of ACME joining W3C, the W3C Director certifies the key
of Wiley, their AC Rep:</p>

<blockquote>
  Kdirector assures "ACRep(Kwiley, ACME)"</blockquote>

<p>Wiley appoints John Doe to represent ACME to W3C by publishing a signed
assertion:</p>

<blockquote>
  Kwiley assures "memberRep(KjohnDoe, ACME)"</blockquote>

<p>The W3C Webmaster records his/her trust in the W3C Director on matters of
member representation ala:</p>

<blockquote>
  Kwebmaster assures "\forall org, rep ((Kdirector assures "memberRep(rep,
  org)") => memberRep(rep, org))"</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the secretariat of a member confidential meeting arranges that
Kwebmaster sign a statement that the meeting record is member
confidential:</p>

<blockquote>
  \forall K, org (memberRep(K, org) => hasAccess(K,
meetingRecord))</blockquote>

<p>When John Doe requests the meeting record, he will get an HTTP
authentication challenge. To meet this challenge, he must prove to the web
server that</p>

<blockquote>
  Kwebmaster assures hasAccess(KjohnDoe, meetingRecord)</blockquote>

<p>This follows from the above: the webmaster grants access to that page to
any member representative, and trusts the W3C Director on matters of
membership representation; the W3C Director, in turn, delegates that decision
to AC Reps; Wiley has appointed John Doe a representative of ACME, and so he
is granted access.</p>

<p>The proof-checking machinery required in the web server to make use of the
statements above is similar to previous work done in TAOS [Wobber et al. 1993]
with BAN logic [Burrows et al. 1990].  In the Semantic Web project we propose
to show that proof checking on access can be scalable to the entire Web.</p>

<p>Note, too, that in principle the above statements can be recorded anywhere;
they needn't be stored inside the trusted computing base of the W3C web
server, and the W3C administrative staff needn't be aware that Wiley has
appointed John Doe a representative of ACME. This obliges John Doe to assemble
all these facts and arrange them into a proof when submitting his request for
access to the page.</p>

<p>In practice the web server will have a limited ability to construct proofs
for common cases of authorization, in addition to its general ability to check
these proofs. But member organizations can implement arbitrarily complex
policies without burdening the W3C administrative team by publishing their own
signed assertions and implementing their own agent for generating
authorization proofs. Computation of these assertions may be by heuristic,
rather than by rigorous logical calculation, provided that the exported proof
still meets the standards of SWeLL and the access control system's proof
verifier.</p>

<h3>Information Management: An Unstructured Application<a
name="Haystack"></a></h3>

<p>Where the day to day management of the W3C is a well-structured and largely
deterministic process, many web applications are more heuristic and less
sharply defined. Inter-document relationships and relevance, as manipulated
for example by web search engines and recommender systems, are exemplary of
this less formally structured kind of relationship.</p>

<p>Haystack is a system that we have built for information management. In its
current incarnation, we have focused on the management of individual corpora,
i.e., the information with which a single user interacts. Modern information
management tools -- such as information retrieval and data mining algorithms
-- have been effective at facilitating interaction with global corpora such as
the World Wide Web. This one-size-fits-all approach to information management
has been roughly analogous to a public library: the corpus is large, broad,
and impersonal, and the retrieval tools are relatively insensitive to
individual and contextual differences among their users. Haystack's focus on
individual corpora and personalized information management is more like one's
own bookshelf. Your own haystack collects the information with which
<i>you</i> interact, captures the <i>contexts</i> within which you use it, and
<i>learns</i> how you organize that information. So, for example, you can ask
your haystack for "the paper I just read that was on the same topic as the
email I forwarded to Pat last Thursday." This query mixes content ("topic")
and context ("email I forwarded..."); it relies on interconnections ("same
topic") and interactions ("paper I just read") that are meaningful only to its
particular user.</p>

<p>Haystack already allows browsing and annotation of the Haystack internal
data model. Haystack's internal data model is a lot like RDF and we will be
providing translators between these two models for import/export of Haystack
data. We will adapt the Haystack UI to browse and annotate Semantic Web
information. This includes some rudimentary graph browsing as well as an
attempt at semi-sensible "structure" browsing.</p>

<p>At the same time, the power of individual haystacks would be significantly
enhanced by connecting them; this is a direction we will undertake using the
Semantic Web.  Haystacks represent the information environments of their
users.  It would be of great benefit if individual haystacks could be used as
proxies for collaboration. After all, if you can't find what you're looking
for on your own bookshelf, you are more likely to turn to your neighbor --
either for access to his bookshelf or to ask for advice -- than to head to the
library. Under the current proposal, we intend to address exactly this issue.
One's own haystack contains a substantial collection of one's own
intelligence. It represents the areas of one's expertise. And, having learned
one's perspective on that information, it embodies one's own biases and
insights. By allowing one haystack to query another, we facilitate information
sharing, expert identification, and community building. This will be
accomplished by adding DAML facilities to Haystack, allowing one haystack to
communicate with another using the power of the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Information management is the heart of the W3C operation.  During the
course of developing a specification a large corpus of contextual information
is created.  This corpus includes discussion threads and rationale for each
portion of the specification and detailed issues with their resolution.  The
W3C process requires consensus but provides for recording of dissenting
opinions as a means to allow consensus to be reached.  When a draft
specification is later presented for advancement to a higher status, the
issues list and minority statements should become part of the review process. 
The information management system should facilitate discovery of common
threads of discourse.  This is especially challenging when those threads are
separated in time and when the terminology used by the discussants changes and
evolves.  In the Semantic Web we intend to investigate the use of Haystack's
heuristics for finding related information and develop an augmented set of
authoring tools for annotating discussion threads and the evolution of
terminology.</p>

<p>This of course introduces significant privacy and information control
issues, not unlike those of the W3C's access control. We intend to adapt the
W3C ACL system (to be developed under this project) for use in inter-haystack
collaboration and information export. There may be substantial differences
between the specific rules of access control for the W3C's activities and
those of information sharing among haystacks; but this is precisely the kind
of flexibility that the Semantic Web is designed to support. Haystack may
accept different justifications from W3C ACL, but the underlying proof
language and much of the verification infrastructure will be shared between
these systems. Accordingly, we expect to adapt the Haystack UI to support
manual proof verification, i.e., to browse the proof and accept/reject
statements with human assistance.</p>

<p>As Haystack deals typically with subjective and vaguely-defined terms such
as relevance and information quality, the algorithms it uses are generally
heuristics controlled and adjusted by the user. This sets it apart from the
mechanical, logical operations of the W3C operational machinery. The systems
are in that way quite distinct. The real power of the Semantic Web will be
evidenced not by inter-haystack sharing, but by the ways in which this same
DAML integration allows information sharing between a haystack and a radically
different information producer or consumer.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the export of Haystack data to the access control
system. Suppose (for some reason) a person wants to make access to their
research papers available to interested academics in the field, but not to the
general public. A haystack can be used to heuristically generate a collection
of names of authors of papers whose contents match the specified field,
together with their email addresses. This information can be exported in one
of two ways. First, the haystack can export a list of the email addresses of
all qualifying individuals as an RDF file on the Semantic Web. She or he then
introduces into the formula for access to the documents a term which allows
access by people whose email addresses are in the list. The secure system has
been allowed to trust -- for a specific purpose only -- the output of a rough
and ready heuristic. More extremely, the Haystack can produce, on demand, a
SWeLL justification as to why a particular email address should be included.
This justification includes reference to relationships, such as document
relevance, that are meaningful only within Haystack. But it also includes
reference to other relationships, such as the Dublin Core's creator metadata,
that may be directly manipulable by the consuming system.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>There is, of course, no reason to limit communication over the Semantic Web
to these two applications. Indeed, in options to this proposal, we intend to
develop a variety of other DAML applications that will similarly benefit from
exploitation of the universality of communication over the Semantic Web. We
would then expect to create, for example, a spoken language interface to the
information contained in one's Haystack; an intentional naming scheme that
allows one to locate W3C working groups with relevant interests; or construct
a complete vacation planner on the fly.</p>

<p>This project is a test on a finite scale of a system designed to scale in
an unbounded fashion. Aspects of the Semantic Web's features supporting smooth
evolution of technology will only be tested thoroughly when similar but
independent systems are independently designed and later merged by the
creation of linking rules. For example, if another organization were to model
its processes independently and later connect the shared concepts (such as
"meeting") to W3C's so as to directly enable shared calendars, then we would
have a success.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>
The Oxygen project, currently underway at MIT, brings numerous LCS and
AI lab researchers together to build a ubiquitous computational
infrastructure involving both handheld and embedded computational
units.  The projects fitting into Oxygen include speech technology (as
a user interface), Haystack (for knowledge representation) and the
Intentional Naming System (for naming and resource discovery).  All of
these systems could benefit by sharing a common representational
infrastructure using the Semantic Web.  Haystack has already been
discussed; here we discuss the other potential integrations.

 <P>

For more than a decade, the Spoken Language Systems Group has been
conducting research in human language technologies and their
utilization in conversational interfaces -- interfaces that can
understand the verbal query in order to help users create, access, and
manage information.  Their technologies, which have been ported to
eight languages and more than a dozen applications, are based on a
semantic representation of the input query, in the form of a
hierarchical frame consisting of key-value pairs.  The semantic frame
is the central point for database access, discourse and dialogue
modelling, as well as natural language generation.  Their involvement
in the Semantic Web effort will provide a much needed perspective
based on human language.  Furthermore, many of the tools developed by
the speech group work by extracting information from other systems:
for example, the Jupiter system responds to weather queries by finding
appropriate information on the web---currently in textual form.
Representing this information semantically would improve Jupiter's
ability to answer queries.

 <P>
The intentional naming system (INS) [Adjie-Winoto et al. 1999] currently under development
at LCS is intended for naming and resource discovery in future mobile
networks of devices and services.  The idea in intentional naming is
to name entities based on descriptive attributes, rather than simply
on network location (which is what the DNS does).  This allows
applications to discover resources based on <EM>what</EM> they are
looking for, rather than <EM>where</EM> they are located in the network.
This is natural for most applications, since they often can describe
the former but do not know about the latter.

 <P> INS benefits greatly from the Semantic Web and its associated
markup language, since it needs an expressive naming syntax to
describe entities (e.g., the closest and least loaded printer near
where you're standing right now).  It also needs to be able to
standardize similar services that might be advertised by their
providers with different names, as in one person calling the device a
"printer" and the other calling it a "paper output device."  The
Semantic Web makes this possible.

 <P>
Because INS incorporates techniques in its resolution architecture to
handle service and user mobility as well as group communication, we
believe that using the Semantic Web in this system will allow us to
explore and demonstrate the benefits of the semantic web in mobile
networks of devices and services.


<h2>E. Evaluation</h2>

<p>The primary means of evaluation to be used in this project are those
centered around feasibility demonstration by actual deployment of the
technology. Although the earlier experimental phases of this project will
require more limited deployment than the later, more finished stages, we
anticipate employing our own work to the extent possible as a primary means of
evaluation.</p>

<p>In this project, we will integrate the results of our work at the earliest
possible stage into the daily work of the World Wide Web Consortium. The
philosophy of "Live Early Adoption and Demonstration" (LEAD) has been a
operational tool at the Consortium for the last few years. It is an approach
that we have found particularly effective in those areas (such as web-based
collaboration) where the weakest link has been between the development of
technology and its actual deployment. For example, the Consortium's practical
use of its Amaya (web authoring and browsing) client and Jigsaw server has
shed considerable light on interactive editing in HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p>Because many of the prototypical tools that we are building will be
organizational process management tools, we anticipate using these tools in
the running of the World Wide Web Consortium. This will put pressure on these
tools to be useful and functional as well as robust; by living with them, we
will also quickly learn where they must be improved. As these tools become
more sophisticated, we will increasingly deploy them in critical-path
Consortium operations.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web is primarily a tool for interoperability. This is why we
are proposing to build a suite of applications, rather than a single
monolithic application. The goal of interoperability between heterogeneous
components that we build is one that will test the extent to which the
Semantic Web is achieving its promise. The more diverse the systems
interoperating, the greater the merit of the Semantic Web. Initially, we
expect the process management tools and information management tools to be
somewhat separate. As the Semantic Web's interoperability increases, we expect
to see further synergies arise between these diverse systems. This will be a
reflection of the extent to which the Semantic Web is achieving its goals. The
broader set of option components will increase the rigor of this test.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the test of the Semantic Web--and the applications that we
build for it--will be the extent to which applications built by others
interoperate with ours. The next test is transmission of information between
our applications and those built by other DAML contractors. If the Semantic
Web lives up to its potential, even this phase will ultimately be surpassed by
one in which non-participant organizations construct applications to exploit
this infrastructure. Similarly, we will judge our tools by the extent to which
they are ultimately useful to other groups.</p>

<p>An interesting result of the project will be to find how much logical
information (from inference rules and other metadata) can in practice be
exchanged between systems. It may be that in certain applications much more
significant information is in the logic than in any raw data, in which case
the Semantic Web will enable a dramatic enhancement of interoperability. This
project is designed to get as much advanced experience early on, before very
large scale deployment. The diversity of systems successfully interfaced to
the Semantic Web will be an important indicator of success. The deployment of
the system into the running working processes of the W3C will sometimes mean
that practical concerns may dictate what systems can be changed
and in which ways at the time of deployment.
Therefore the research aspect of the project will have to be adaptable
to these practical concerns.
However, it will have the advantage of running tests on live data rather than
imagined or simulated scenarios, including new real life application needs
which arise unforeseen during development. It will also increase the
applicability of experience and even running code to second generation
adopters of the technology.</p>


<h2 id="Claims">H. Proprietary Claims</h2>

<p>There are no proprietary claims by an external party on the ideas or
products of this project.  MIT and the researchers in this proposal have full
control over all intellectual and material rights.</p>



<h2 id="Work">I. Statement of Work</h2>

<p>This project will contribute to the development of a vibrant, ubiquitous
Semantic Web by building critical Semantic Web infrastructure and
demonstrating how that infrastructure can be used by working, user-oriented
applications.</p>

<h3>SWeLL Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Basic SWeLL infrastructure components, the building blocks of all Semantic
Web applications to be produced by this project, will be built first, and then
refined throughout the life of the activity.  The basic components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SWeLL parser</li>
  <li>Proof generator</li>
  <li>Proof checker</li>
  <li>Authoring tool</li>
  <li>Schema editor</li>
  <li>Query language</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the parser, proof generator, and proof checker are built, they will be
used together to establish the basic functionality of logical expression in
the SWeLL environment. As other components are built, they will be deployed in
various combinations to develop SWeLL functionality for both the W3C web site
and Haystack.</p>

<h3>Haystack export as RDF</h3>

<p>A  Haystack HTTP server makes Haystack data available as RDF.</p>

<h4>Foundation verification</h4>

<p>This involves the refinement (if necessary) of SWeLL, the definition of a
proof transfer language, the construction of a parser and of  a proof
validator for that language, and the publication of test data.</p>

<h4>Import of  W3C corpus into Haystack</h4>

<p>The collection and state of W3C documents is made available to Haystack
users.</p>

<h4>Access validating HTTP server</h4>

<p>With the definition of an access control schema and an extension to HTTP,
we modify an existing HTTP server to use the proof engine and accept SWeLL
requests for authentication. This will be tested with an HTTP client modified
to send (hand-written, not automatically generated) access justifications.</p>

<h4>Exposure of W3C administrative systems</h4>

<p>At least two W3C administrative systems should be available on the Semantic
Web at this stage. This will involve creation of schemas for the systems
involved and the generation of custom user agents or (in most cases) the
modification of legacy systems to generate SWeLL.</p>

<h4>Import/Export of Haystack in SWeLL</h4>

<p>The export of Haystack data to the Semantic Web requires the generation of
schemas and the conversion of internal formats to RDF.  At around the same
time we hope to demonstrate the import on demand of arbitrary data from the
Semantic Web into a user's haystack. This adds Haystack's user interface to
the Semantic Web toolset.</p>

<h4>Cross-domain query demonstration</h4>

<p>Choosing an appropriate query language, we make a query across previously
disjoint domains as a test rather than live system.</p>

<h4>Socially meaningful cross-domain operation</h4>

<p>A cross-domain query that provides a socially useful function, modelling
the real social needs of the organization, for example PINS and ACLs.</p>

<h4>Community evangelism and deployment (years 3 and 4)</h4>

<p>The pace of uptake of technology in the commercial community at large is
difficult to predict in the current enthusiastic environment.  As sufficient
interest occurs that this is possible, we will coordinate its transition to
the W3C standards process.</p>

<h2>L. Technology Sharing</h2>

<p>Technology developed under this proposal will be propagated through the
very same mechanisms that have enabled the rapid spread of today's core World
Wide Web standards.  Sharing DAML-based technology will occur along three
dimensions, with different user communities becoming involved as the
technology increasingly matures.</p>

<p>The first axis of technology sharing is with explicit supporting partners
such as  World Wide Web Consortium staff and members, the LCS Oxygen
environment, and DAML collaborators.  The second axis involves sharing with
public metadata communities, W3C Metadata standards activities, and related
open source and academic communities.  Finally, the third axis of technology
sharing is to move mature DAML infrastructure to the W3C standards track and,
as appropriate, other standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task
Force.</p>

<p>Axis one of technology sharing will occur within the confines the two
chosen DAML testbeds, Haystack and the W3C community.  With 60 staff in three
sites around the world and over 380 member organizations internationally, the
W3C community will provide a substantial testbed for initial application of
DAML-based software and services developed by this project.  For example, as
soon as the DAML-based access control tools are stable, they will be deployed
on the W3C web site for use in mediating W3C member access to W3C documents
and services. Later, as authoring tools become available, they will be made
available to members for use in creating W3C documents and associated
metadata. Other tools such as proof checkers and heuristic document management
systems will also be deployed to address W3C workflow and collaboration
issues. Drawing an analogy between this phase of Semantic Web technology
sharing and the original development of the World Wide Web, one may see basic
DAML tools serving the same role as the original CERN phonebook did. This
first phase of technology sharing will provide the DAML team with vital input
on the soundness of our design and begin the process of building broader
support for the DAML approach.</p>

<p>Through the life of the Semantic Web activity, the links with LCS's Oxygen
project will also provide key technology sharing and evangelism opportunities.
In particular, the corporate partners in Oxygen  will be a valuable sounding
board for assessing the commercial viability of DAML and an important venue
for technology transfer from the laboratory to the market. Oxygen research
will shed light on semantic web interface with novel operating system
internals and distributed applications.</p>

<p>The second axis of DAML deployment will bring tools and techniques
developed with DAML to the attention of well-known public metadata communities
such as the Dublin Core bibliographic schema and the OpenGIS framework for
representing geographic information. An important avenue of technology
diffusion  will be the W3C's RDF Interest Group, a global community of
metadata developers who work in this group to coordinate their efforts and
provide W3C feedback on its metadata standardization efforts. While we do not
expect these communities to necessarily accept the entire DAML framework they
will provide vital corpora of metadata on which to test DAML. At this stage we
also expect increased interaction with the communities developing the XML
Signature Specification for attaching digital signatures to XML, as well as
developers working on the Platform for Privacy Preferences (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/P3P">P3P</a>), which will have significant overlap
with IMP. Finally, in this phase we would expect to use Haystack tools to
interact with these public metadata stores.</p>

<p>In the final axis of technology sharing, we will concentrate on bringing
critical DAML infrastructure components into the W3C standards development
process.  This is of course not a unilateral action by W3C staff, and happens
only when community consensus is that work on standards would be worthwhile.
Deployment along the other two axes will hopefully  bring this about.  The <a
href="/Consortium/Process">W3C Process document</a> describes the creation of
new standardization activities. As the recognized source of Web standards, W3C
is in a unique position to move concepts developed in this project into the
public Web.  As has been noted, W3C has already completed a first round of Web
metadata standards through our RDF work. We expect that DAML will provide
valuable guidance to the Web development community as a whole on evolving the
Semantic Web.  W3C's close liaisons with other standards bodies, especially
the IETF and the WAP Forum, will also provide valuable opportunities for
technology sharing.</p>


<h2>M. Facilities</h2>

<p>All work carried out by MIT under this proposal will be conducted at the
MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, the major site for computer science
research at MIT.   The Laboratory provides a basic computing environment for
research, including common services such as Internet access and printing.  LCS
provides administrative support for contract research, which will be utilized
by the proposed project.  LCS co-ordinates the physical plant provided to the
research groups.   Equipment and facilities required to support specific
research programs, such as computational workstations, specialized network
facilities, and dedicated servers and prototyping machines, is acquired on a
per-program basis. This proposal includes an equipment budget to acquire such
facilities for this project. The required facilities fall into (how many)
categories: explanation of computers and servers here. MIT is unable to supply
these facilities from institutional resources.   </p>

<p>The MIT Laboratory for Computer Science is the United States host for the
World Wide Web Consortium The W3C team and research groups are equipped with
recent computing systems, and sufficient bandwidth for efficient  work with
other national and international collaborators, including video conferencing. 
The Consortium has a collaborative web server allowing delegated authority to 
work in creative shared spaces, hypertext email archives, an Event Tracking
Agent for issue tracking, and automated facilities for meeting organiztion. We
have three conventional telephone conference bridges and Internet video
conferencing facilities.  The Lab  generally can offer wireless LAN
(802.11+DHCP) access for meeting guests.</p>


<h2 id="Property">N. Government Furnished Property</h2>

<p>
No Government furnished property is required for this research.
</p>



<h2>O. Experience</h2>

<p>This projects involves a new collaboration between two organizations: The
World Wide Web Consortium and the MIT Lab for Computer Science.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium W3C was established in 1994 in response to a
growing demand for a coordination body for the rapid development of Web
standards. It was founded by the inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee (PI on
this project), and is hosted by MIT LCS in the USA, INRIA in France, and Keio
University in Japan, with offices in several other countries. The W3C has over
the last 6 years overseen processes of issue raising, design, consensus
building and testing resulting in about 20 Recommendations including HTML,
XML, XHTML, XML Transformations (XSL), Cascading Style Sheets, and Portable
Network Graphics. </p>

<p>The need for common standards for interchange of metadata (information
about Web resources) drove the Consortium to create, in the Resource
Description Framework (RDF), a general knowledge representation language of
limited power and great extensibility. Ralph Swick (co-PI on this proposal)
was and is the W3C metadata lead and co-author of the RDF Model and Syntax
Recommendation.</p>

<p>The W3C Technology and Society Domain, lead by Daniel Weitzner (co-PI on
this proposal) has lead the Web community in developing technology to assist
in solving social problems such as privacy and authentication. The PINS
information management tools proposed as part of this project will draw
heavily on the W3C's work on the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and
work on digital signatures for XML.</p>

<p>The MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) is an interdepartmental
laboratory, bringing together faculty, researchers, and students in a broad
program of study, research and experimentation. The Laboratory's principal
goal is to pursue innovations in information technology that will yield
long-term improvements in the ways that people live and work. The hallmark of
its research is a balanced consideration of technological capability and human
utility.</p>

<p>Currently, LCS is focusing its research on the architectures of tomorrow's
information infrastructures. In the interest of making computers more
efficient and easier to use, LCS researchers are putting great effort into
human-machine communication via speech understanding; designing new computers,
operating systems, and communications architectures for a networked world;
automating information gathering and organization; and the theoretical
underpinnings of CS.</p>

<p>One central technology in the current LCS agenda is the Haystack project
led by co-PIs David Karger and Lynn Andrea Stein.  Haystack combines the
function of a traditional text-document retrieval system with the gathering,
representation, presentation and management of arbitrary metadata, forming a
personal information management tool and a part of the semantic information
space for LCS's next-generation computer systems.   Haystack builds on
Karger's previous work in information retrieval (including Scatter/Gather) and
Stein's research in knowledge representation (especially nonmonotonic logics),
software agents (including the Sodabot agent environment in the MIT AI Lab's
DARPA-funded Intelligent Room), and web manipulation (e.g., the 
Squeal/ParaSite structured web interface).</p>

<p>Other LCS members whose work will inform this project include Steve Garland
