Information Science: Where Does it Come From and Where is it Going?</strong>
    <p/>
The New Jersey Chapter of the American Society for Information Science & Technology (NJ/ASIS&T) is pleased to honor Tefko Saracevic, Ph.D. with its 21st annual Distinguished Lectureship Award.
    <p/>
Dr. Saracevic, Professor II at Rutgers University�s School of Communication, Information and Library Studies, is scheduled to speak in conjunction with the School�s 25th anniversary celebration on Friday, October 12 at 4:30 PM.  His lecture, entitled �<b>Information Science: Where Does it Come From and Where is it Going?</b>" will be held at the Heldrich Hotel, 10 Livingston Avenue in downtown New Brunswick.
    <p/>
Beginning with an overview and brief history of information science, including its problems and solutions within a social context, Dr. Saracevic will discuss research, development and testing in the area of information retrieval, and commercial information retrieval in the form of search engines.  Dr. Saracevic will discuss the relationships between information science, librarianship, and the growth of digital libraries. Following Dr. Saracevic�s lecture will be a reception at the hotel.
    <p/>
In addition to teaching at Rutgers University�s School of Communication, Information and Library Studies, Dr. Saracevic is the author of numerous articles on topics such as testing and evaluation of information retrieval systems; the notion of relevance in information science; and digital libraries.  He has also presented papers at international meetings in 43 countries and is a co-chair of the annual conference and course Libraries in the Digital Age (LIDA) held in Dubrovnik, Croatia.  Dr. Saracevic is a former president of the American Society for Information Science & Technology, which bestowed him with its prestigious Award of Merit.  He has also received the Gerard Salton Award for Excellence in Research from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval.  Currently, he is the editor-in-chief of the international journal <i>Information Processing & Management</i>.

    in Interactive Webcasting </font></strong> </p>

  <p>Media spaces are environments that incorporate computer and communication 
    technologies, typically including the Internet, to allow distributed groups 
    of individuals to interact in real-time. My talk will begin by reviewing 
    past media space work on desktop videoconferencing, electronic classrooms, 
    and meeting capture, especially projects at Xerox, Toronto, Sun, Berkeley, 
    Microsoft, and Georgia Tech. We focus particularly on webcasting as an interesting 
    media space that has excellent potential for scalability across a large 
    number of sites. The downside is that webcasting is typically a one-way 
    broadcast from a transmitter to a multitude of receivers, and an ephemeral 
    event that exists only during the live broadcast. </p>
  <p>The Toronto ePresence Interactive Media system creates a media space that 
    allows distributed groups of individuals to participate and interact in 
    webcast events such as lectures, and to do so before, during, and after 
    the event. The system currently supports video, audio, slide, and screen 
    broadcasting; concurrent slide review; integrated moderated chat and VoIP 
    support for questions and discussion; tailorable skins; the automated creation 
    of structured, navigable, searchable event archives, and automated data 
    collection for evaluation. Speakers are not forced to use PowerPoint &#151; 
    ePresence transmits several rich media presentation formats. The system 
    is highly cross-platform, supports viewing at bandwidths as low as 56K, 
    and is being distributed via open source and community source strategies. 
    I shall introduce the system and describe some eLearning and medical education 
    projects to which it has been applied. </p>
  <p>Perhaps the most important achievement is the creation of a flexible, modular, 
    extensible infrastructure for exploring frontiers of collaboration technologies, 
    for example the following research challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>combining webcasting to many viewers with audio conferencing via VoIP 
      to a few participants </li>
    <li> enhancing in-room awareness of remote participants via text chat displays 
      and webcam slow scan video </li>
    <li> achieving voice recognition of lectures, and solving human factors 
      issues in using imperfect transcripts </li>
    <li>enabling persistent conversation over webcasts (both live and archived) 
      for learning communities </li>
    <li>enhancing collaboration support for distributed teams, e.g., integrating 
      ePresence with blogging and wikis </li>
    <li>allowing user control of live webcasts, including pausing them briefly 
      and then having them &#147;catch up&#148; </li>
    <li> evaluating ePresence in real eLearning uses, such as a test for tri-campus 
      education planned for the fall. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The talk will report on early results in tackling the first four challenges 
    and directions for the other three. </p>
