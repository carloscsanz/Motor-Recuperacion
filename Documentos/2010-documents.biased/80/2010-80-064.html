<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why, when weâ€™re in a recession, did we decide to change Cadillacâ€™s green street signs to blue? Just certain ones are changed.</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/27/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Several years ago, it was decided that the street signs should be updated to incorporate the new city logo, says Bob Johnson, the cityâ€™s Public Works director. Additionally, larger lettering was used, making it easier for drivers to read the signs, he said.<br>
<br>
The project has been under way for two years and, based upon the availability of funds, should be completed in approximately five years. According to the cityâ€™s recently updated 2011-15 capital improvement program, city officials anticipate using state Motor Vehicle Highway Funds to pay for the new signs.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Are there going to be any job fairs in the Cadillac area in the near future?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/27/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover asked Baker College Director of Career Services Jackie Soltman for help with this one. Every year the college has a job fair and last year there were two. One was a general job fair while the second focused on the health care industry.<br>
<br>
While Baker College is not going to have health care job fair this year, Soltman said it will be hosting its general job fair.<br>
<br>
"Itâ€™s a new date, new time and new place. Itâ€™s open to current students, past students, alumni and the general public," she said.<br>
<br>
This year the job fair will be held at the Cadillac Armory from 1 to 4 p.m. on March 12. Right now there are 53 booths committed to the fair but Soltman said the hope is to have 60 by the time of the job fair.<br>
<br>
For more information about the job fair call Baker College at 876-3100.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Our neighbor puts more trash out right after the trash is picked up. What can we do about that?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/27/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'> According to Bob Johnson, Director of Public Works for the City of Cadillac, regulations for the handling of curbside trash fall under the cityâ€™s Solid Waste Ordinance.<br>
<br>
A. According to the ordninance, itâ€™s the duty of a dwelling owner or occupant to place trash out on the day scheduled for collection. Containers should be set out, as directed, on the day of the pick-up.<br>
<br>
Many people, however, set them out the night before, because their work schedule does not allow them to be at home in the morning. Such actions are acceptable, but using the curb as a storage site for waste for day after day before the trash man shows up is not.<br>
<br>
Neighborâ€™s violations may be reported to Pam Klifman, the Code Enforcement Officer at the Cadillac Department of Public Safety.<br>
<br>
"If they are in violation of the city code, they will take appropriate action," Johnson said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why do the police always ask for the publicâ€™s help to solve a crime? We donâ€™t have the training that they have, and we donâ€™t get paid for it like they do. We would never think to ask the police to help us do our jobs. Also, the security camera pictures are usually distorted, so why use them?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/20/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cadillac Director of Public Safety Jeff Hawke said police departments often ask the public for help in solving crimes because police officers partner with citizens to protect the community. He continued by saying citizens often witness crimes and have information that would be helpful to police officers in accomplishing their mission. No special training is required to provide information to a police officer. Police/community partnerships are the essence of community policing, he said.<br>
<br>
As for the cameras, Hawke said security camera pictures are sometimes distorted because of the quality of equipment used in recording the video. Darkness, distance, movement and many other technical issues impact the quality of video recordings. Many small business owners donâ€™t have funds for expensive video systems and install the best system they can afford. Security camera video footage and pictures assist greatly with investigating crimes. Many criminals have been identified as a result of video security systems, he said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Are there any plans to have shooting programs at Dillon YMCA as this would be a benefit to Tom Jr.â€™s legacy. As he would tell of shooting as a 10-12 year old at the Cass School. I am sure that Tom would smile down from heaven if this was to happen. There can be no guns at schools anymore but the YMCA would be out of this jurisdiction and would be a great benefit to Tomâ€™s memory.</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/20/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The short answer is "no," said Chris Gentry, executive director of the Cadillac Area YMCA Dillon Community Center.<br>
<br>
"This is the first time itâ€™s come up, so we hadnâ€™t considered it at all," Gentry said. "Like anything, we would have to consider programs based on member input or on somebody who comes to us with a program idea."<br>
<br>
Noting that nobody on the current Y staff "does anything with shooting," Gentry added that another factor to consider is the Yâ€™s close proximity to houses, parking lots, Baker College and businesses. However, Gentry encourages people who are interested in starting Y program that meet a community need or serves the community to give him a call.<br>
<br>
"Weâ€™re always interested and willing to talk about that," Gentry said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Who is responsible for designing the Mitchell Street project? The lanes seem too narrow, the parking sections do not fit normal size cars. The bumpouts are not visible at night and are being struck by drivers, and we have lost eight parking spots on each intersection. What gives?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/06/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) Cadillac Transportation Service Center designed the 2009 Mitchell Street project.<br>
<br>
According to MDOT, the width of the current travel and parking lanes in the downtown area is the same as before the road was reconstructed in the summer of 2009. Also, both the current travel and parking lanes meet national standards.<br>
<br>
Between Chapin and Howard streets, MDOT eliminated most of the rarely-used parallel parking, which increased the travel laneâ€™s width. South of Howard Street, the lanes were already - and still are - wider than downtown, MDOT said.<br>
<br>
While the bumpouts on Mitchell St. mean fewer parking spots, MDOT said it added the bumpouts to increase safety.<br>
<br>
According to MDOT, prior to the 2009 construction, the last parallel-parked cars on Mitchell Street at each intersection obstructed the vision of motorists and pedestrians attempting to enter Mitchell Street. MDOT said the bumpouts are made more obvious to drivers at night with streetlights, and that delineator posts with reflectors have been placed to alert drivers to bumpouts in the event of snow.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/06/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Those bulbs are among the numerous items that are accepted during the Household Hazardous Waste Day the City of Cadillac and Wexford County jointly hold every spring and fall.<br>
<br>
An exact date for this springâ€™s event has yet to be announced, according to the cityâ€™s Utilities Department.<br>
<br>
In addition to fluorescent light bulbs, those doing some spring cleaning in the home and garage, as well as yardwork, can use this event as an opportunity to dispose of items such as aerosols, floor care products, medicines, rechargeable batteries, insecticides and herbicides, rodent poison, brake fluid and oil-based paints and turpentine. </td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover also is excited to see how ESPN tells the story of when KISS came to Cadillac. For those unaware of the unique story, the rock band KISS visited Cadillac in 1975 at the invitation of the Cadillac High School football team.<br>
<br>
Although crews were in Cadillac last fall filming, the date the segment will air has not been nailed down, however, the wait appears to be almost over. All signs indicate that Feb. 28 will be the date that ESPN will tell the story of how KISS came to Cadillac. Check the Cadillac News frequently for updates on this story. </td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I recently watched a documentary concerning the 1918 world wide influenza epidemic. I have family ties to Wexford County that reach back and before the turn of the last century. My parents and grandparents lived through the 1918 influenza epidemic, and I have memories of them talking about many things which occurred during this period - WWI, logging, etc. Glaringly absent was any mention of the influenza epidemic. Because of this fact I am asking if Rover could look into the historical records for Wexford County and provide a statistical review of what the countyâ€™s population was in 1918 and the incidents of flu cases and influenza-related deaths.</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/06/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover had to do some checking for this one but was able to find the answer in a story that ran in the Cadillac News on Oct. 29, 2005.<br>
<br>
In the story entitled, "When the flu turned deadly", the reporter did research at the Wexford County Clerkâ€™s office. A scan of death records at the clerkâ€™s office found 88 people died in Wexford County of what was called influenza or pneumonia from October 1918 into April 1919, according to the story.<br>
<br>
As for population, Rover went to the 1910 and 1920 U.S. Censuses to get an idea of what the population was in 1918. In 1910, the population of Wexford County was 20,769 while it dropped to 18,207 in 1920.<br>
<br>
To read the entire story about the local impact of flu pandemic of 1918 go to the Cadillac News web site and search the achieves or simply go to this link, www.cadillacnews.com/articles/2005/10/29/news/news01.txt.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I live in Manton, and I was recently diagnosed with MS. Iâ€™m too young for the senior center, but there doesnâ€™t seem to be much else to do for enjoyment. Are there any activities you know of that I could participate in?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/30/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>While sniffing around for an answer, Rover came up with several solutions to get rid of the boredom blues.<br>
<br>
If youâ€™re interested in cooking or baking or would like to start, the Manton Area Chamber of Commerce is hosting its Fourth Annual Chili Cook-off and Pie Contest at 5:30 p.m. on March 6 at Manton High School. There are only 20 entry spots available, so call Jaimie Fellows at 920-6617 to reserve your spot. If competitive cooking isnâ€™t your thing, for five dollars you can taste all the chili and pie and vote for your favorites.<br>
<br>
Or how about trying your hand at bingo? People of all ages can enjoy this activity at 6 p.m. every Saturday at the VFW Post 7806 in Manton, and all proceeds from the night go to help veteran causes and the community.<br>
<br>
Volunteering is also a worthwhile - and free - way to pass the time. Mantonâ€™s INC Spot, a resale shop through the organization Love In the Name of Christ, is looking for volunteers to help sort and fold clothes and arrange merchandise. Call 824-6511 if interested. The Manton Area Chamber of Commerce needs volunteers for the events it puts on. Call 824-4158 for more information.<br>
<br>
Are music and dancing your flair? A jamboree with acoustic old-time country music, singing and dancing is held at Manton High School in the Ranger Room each month. The event is from 6 to 10 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month, with the exception of April and July, when it will be held on the second Saturdays. You can bring your own instruments, and donations taken at the door benefit the Manton Area Harvest Festival. Call Terry at 389-0042 for more information. In addition, plans for a community Valentineâ€™s dance in Manton are in the works, and more information on it will appear in the Cadillac News in the near future.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>The lights downtown recognize cars; do they also recognize motor scooters and motorcycles?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/30/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The traffic detection cameras placed at intersections on Mitchell Street were designed to detect scooters and motorcycles as well as cars.<br>
<br>
As part of the Mitchell Street project, MDOT mounted non-recording white cameras on the newly-installed strain poles at signalized intersections.<br>
<br>
The cameras are positioned to detect when vehicles appear on side streets. When a vehicle appears in a designated area, the camera triggers the light sequence and gives side-street traffic a green light. This allows Mitchell Street traffic to have a green light, unless someone pulls up to an intersection from a side street.<br>
<br>
The prior traffic detection system was "detection loops," which are placed in the pavement. The cameras are a newer technology which functions with MDOTâ€™s computer-controlled signals and donâ€™t need to be replaced every time there is road work.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Is there a place to get rid of old greeting cards?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/30/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>If theyâ€™re unused, thereâ€™s no need to throw them out. Several resale shops will happily take them off your hands as long as the cards arenâ€™t tattered and torn. That way, not only are you getting rid of something you donâ€™t need, youâ€™re helping someone in need. Proceeds from the sale of donated items help pay for local charitable programs and services.<br>
<br>
Here are some places that accept unused greeting cards:<br>
<br>
â€¢ Friends Ministryâ€™s Just As Nice Thrift Store, 3728 S. Morey Road, Lake City<br>
<br>
â€¢ Goodwill, 2025 N. Mitchell St., Cadillac<br>

â€¢ The INC Spot - 520 N. Michigan Ave., Manton, and 116 W. Upton Reed City<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why canâ€™t the Cadillac (Cinema 5) movie theater have 3D movies?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/16/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Being a movie buff himself, Rover was very interested in finding out the answer to this question. It appears, however, the reason is quite simple. As with most things it comes down to finances. Cadillac Cinema 5 Manager Jennifer Anderson said there are no 3D movies because there needs to be projector upgrades. All the new "RealD" movies like "Avatar" are shown through digital projectors and currently the Cadillac theater does not have them. While Rover could not find an exact cost, he did some snooping on the Internet and found the cost to upgrade a projector and screen easily reaches six digits. The benefit for such an investment allows theaters to charge more for movies that use the technology.<br>
<br>
"It is expensive and eventually we will have them but I donâ€™t know when that will be," she said. "They (Goodrich Quality Theaters) plan on upgrading all their theaters but with the expense associated we just donâ€™t know when."</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/16/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>In the city of Cadillac, there are 93 active residential listings, said Jim Meier, president of the Paul Bunyan Board of Realtors. In Wexford County, there are 448 homes such listings and 189 in Missaukee County, he said.<br>
<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why is the road commission putting all that money into secondary roads that arenâ€™t traveled that much? 46 Road is so rough it about rattles the dashboard off the car.</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 01/16/2010</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover tracked down Alan Cooper, manager of the Wexford County Road Commission, to answer this question.<br>
<br>
Without knowing specifically which roads the inquirer was referring to, Cooper said "itâ€™s very possible that theyâ€™re talking about FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) work."<br>
<br>
The county received FEMA grant money to repair specific roads that were damaged due to the June 13, 2008 storm.<br>
<br>
The road commission is fixing many of these damaged gravel roads, because "thatâ€™s where we have to spend the grant money as outlined by the emergency funding," Cooper said.<br>
<br>
"If weâ€™re talking about 46 Road, it didnâ€™t have washouts," Cooper said. "Weâ€™re fixing roads from FEMA dollars, other roads that weâ€™re not fixing didnâ€™t have wash outs or qualify for FEMA."<br>
<br>
Cooper said he has driven 46 Road and, unless the person is referring to the paved section of the 15-mile road, the gravel part is "not that rough."<br>
<br>
Cooper said the road commission performs regular routine maintenance on gravel roads but doesnâ€™t have money to repave local roads "unless townships and people participate."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>The former Cad-a-Stram building on the corner of N. Mitchell and Ayer St. was to be torn down this past July. Why is it still standing?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 11/21/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Technically, the Cad-a-Stram building is considered a secure structure. And if a building is not a condemned structure, it is not mandatory that it be demolished, according to Precia Garland, Cadillacâ€™s assistant city manager.<br>
<br>
While the owner of the Cad-a-Stram building is not obligated to tear it down, Garland noted that the owner has expressed interest in the removal of the structure.<br>
<br>
"We have spoken with him about its removal," Garland said. "We are investigating possible Brownfield Incentives."<br>
<br>
According to Garland, Brownfield Incentives are usually an economic development tool used to redevelop a Brownfield site. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines Brownfields as property that the "expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant." </td><tr>

<br>
The prior traffic detection system was "detection loops," which are placed in the pavement. The cameras are a newer technology which functions with MDOTâ€™s computer-controlled signals and donâ€™t need to be replaced every time there is road work.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 11/21/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover, too, has smelled that odor while driving down 13th Street but has been unable to sniff out its exact source.<br>
<br>
Rover spoke with Kurt Childs of the air quality division at the Michigan Department of Environmental Qualityâ€™s district office in Cadillac. He said itâ€™s hard to say exactly where in the cityâ€™s three industrial parks the smell is coming from, but based on the description provided by both you and Rover, three businessesâ€™ emissionsâ€™ have a similar distinctive odor. Cadillac Casting Inc., Four Winns and Cadillac Renewable Energy have been known to emit a strong, sweet odor. Some have described the smell at Cadillac Renewable Energy as "piney."<br>
<br>
However, these emissions do not pose a health hazard, he said. Facilities that emit air pollutants must obtain air pollution control permits from the MDEQ and are subject to emission limits and inspections, Childs said.<br>
<br>
Those seeking more details or have concerns about air emissions and odors can contact the MDEQâ€™s air quality division at 775-3960.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cadillacâ€™s city code doesnâ€™t address the number of vehicles someone can keep on their property but it does state that vehicles parked on a property must be operable, says Pam Klifman, city code enforcement officer.<br>
<br>
Also, the city code does not limit the number of detached accessory buildings - such as sheds - in residential districts, according to Jerry Adams, the cityâ€™s community development coordinator. However, it does limit the total area that detached accessory buildings may occupy.<br>
<br>
Such buildings cannot be constructed on a lot unless the parcel also contains a principal structure like a residential dwelling. Then, it cannot occupy more than 25 percent of a rear yard, provided that in no instance shall all of the accessory buildings exceed 65 percent of the ground floor area of the main building.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>The timing of the traffic light at the intersection of 13th Street and North Mitchell is set so very, very few cars make it traveling east and west through the intersection. Can MDOT review the timing of that traffic light?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 11/07/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>In 2008, the 13th Street and Mitchell Street intersection was part of a signal optimization project that adjusted the systemâ€™s light timing to minimize peoplesâ€™ average wait times at the light, which saves fuel for motorists and reduces pollution, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). MDOT said it adjusted the timing by taking into account all turning movements and each direction of travel.<br>
<br>
MDOT also scheduled this intersection for an upgrade to a "box span signal" during the Mitchell Street project of 2011. Box spans are MDOTâ€™s new method for better positioning traffic signals at an intersection; the box span design removes traditional traffic signals from the middle of an intersection and instead lights are hung from wires attached to poles placed at each corner of the intersection, thus the "box" design.<br>
<br>
The signal upgrade should increase safety for motorists who will better be able to see the signal due to its position and new brighter LED lights, according to MDOT.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover talked to several people concerning this question but couldnâ€™t exactly get a firm answer.

<br>
"We are in the process of a long-term plan. It includes extending it outside of the city but also improving and enhancing the existing Greenway and river within the city," she said. "Removing the cement would be one of the things we are looking at."<br>

Steve Cunningham also had an idea of what the cement was from but said his information was "anecdotal." He said there was a previous railroad bridge across the Clam River but there also was something else that could have resulted in the cement piles.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>DNR Wildlife Biologist Pete Kailing said there could be two reasons why the bird is pecking - food or claiming territory.<br>
<br>
"They are announcing they are around, to attract a mate or to say they are around," he said.<br>
<br>
To deter the birds, Kailing said a person can use decoys like a hawk silhouette or something that is flashy, like a mirror or a mylar balloon. He also said a noise deterrent such as banging pots and pans when they start pecking or firing a cap gun or firearm can work. He also said there are odor repellents but a person should do his or her homework so as not to make a bigger mess.<br>
<br>
If the woodpeckers are there for food, Kailing said, that may be an indication that there is an infestation and you may want to look at that.<br>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 10/24/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) detoured traffic for the Mitchell Street project onto Lake Street to replace the railway crossing, which required a road closure, and because the city of Cadillac requested to install new water mains and sanitary sewer mains from Granite Street to Howard Street.<br>
<br>
"In the interest of public safety and with the concurrence of the city (of Cadillac), MDOT extended the three-week detour for the railroad work to eight weeks to include the (cityâ€™s) requested utility work," said Wayne Emington, transportation engineer for MDOT.<br>
<br>
Since the detour benefitted MDOT, MDOT paid for some project features and items which normally would have been paid for by the city of Cadillac, such as paving the parking lanes downtown. Therefore, the city of Cadillac is responsible for maintenance and restoration work on city streets utilized for the detour route during the project.<br>
<br>
According to City of Cadillac engineer Bruce DeWitt, the city plans on adding Lake Street to its capital improvement list, but it plans on doing more than just resurfacing; DeWitt added that this work will be done when funding is available.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Jeff Hawke, public safety director at the Cadillac Police Department, the motor vehicle code law indicates vehicles should not be left standing or parked on a roadway when possible.<br>
<br>
"In the case on Mitchell Street, it isnâ€™t possible for commercial vehicles to parallel park because they are generally too wide and will take up the outside lane." Hawke said.<br>
<br>
Hawke said while the vehicle is in the lane, the term is called "standing," not "parking."<br>
<br>
Commercial vehicles can "stand" for up to 20 minutes with hazard lights on. According to the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code, the driver must put out a marker or flare if the vehicle is stopped in the lane for more than 20 minutes.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover believes that what the inquirer is referring to is not a bump out - itâ€™s a detectable warning.

Detectable warnings are surfaces required at crosswalks by the American Disability Act to alert citizens with low or impaired vision to the fact that a sidewalk crosses a roadway.<br>

The plastic is placed to prevent discoloring and damage to detectable warnings during construction and will be removed before the end of the construction process, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I have heard that gift certificates need to be good for five years. Is this true? Are gift certificates issued for six months invalid?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 09/26/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>First, keep in mind there is a difference between a gift certificate and a gift card. Gift cards are similar in appearance to credit cards, but contain a limited amount of money that it is not tied to your bank account.<br>
<br>
A gift certificate represents the right of the person holding the certificate to present it to a merchant in exchange for goods or services. The main difference is a gift certificate is usually printed on paper, while a gift card is plastic like a credit card.<br>
<br>
Michigan law requires that most gift cards issued by merchants cannot expire within five years of purchase.<br>
<br>
Gift cards issued by banks or financial institutions may expire in less than five years.<br>
<br>
Under Michigan law, as of Nov. 1, 2008 merchants must accept a gift card or gift certificate for personal, family, or household use unless the gift card has an expiration date that is more than five years from the date of purchase and the gift card is presented after the expiration date.<br>
<br>
In general, avoid purchasing a gift card from a merchant that is struggling to stay in business or has filed for bankruptcy. For added protection, use your credit card when buying a gift card. If the merchant closes before you have completely used the card you can refuse to pay the charge and dispute it with your credit card issuer.<br>
<br>
Carefully read restrictions before you purchase a gift card. Be wary if the expiration date is not clearly listed. Ask if there are any fees associated with purchasing the card. The fees cannot come out of the cardâ€™s amount. Ask for an extra receipt and give it to the person you are giving the card to.<br>
<br>
If you run into problems, call the Attorney Generalâ€™s Consumer Protection Division at 877-765-8388.</td><tr>

How will we know if weâ€™re breaking the law?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 09/26/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>In most cases, if a church does not have a fixed food license, the church should not be preparing food in its kitchen without a temporary license. A temporary license is good for up to 14 days and an application for such should be submitted at least four business days in advance. To secure a temporary license, contact your local health department environmental health division for more information.<br>
<br>
According to Thomas Reichard, the environmental health director for District Health Department No. 10, there are three events held at a non-profit organization that are considered exempt from licensing: private events, bake sales and pot lucks.<br>
<br>
"There are some disagreements between local departments about what is considered private," Reichard said. "From our standpoint, funerals and weddings are private events."<br>
<br>
And as far as coffee goes? Doug Fitzgerald, the supervisor for environmental health in Osceola County, said church-goers should be fine.<br>
<br>
"I know coffee is brewed in a church kitchen," Fitzgerald said. "But I donâ€™t think you could get a prosecutor or sanitarian in the state to issue a violation for serving coffee after church service."<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>None of the Hazardous Household Waste Days in the area will be accepting electronics. There are, however, alternative sites to drop off your unwanted electronics.<br>
<br>
For instance, Goodwill Industries, located on 2025 N. Mitchell St. in Cadillac, accepts used computers and computer accessories through the program Reconnect Partnership.<br>
<br>
"If they’re not working, they get recycled," said Amy Johnson-Hill, Goodwill team leader. "If they are working, we can sell them."<br>
<br>
Johnson-Hill also noted that while Goodwill accepts VCRs, they do not accept TVs or microwaves.<br>
<br>
Best Buy will also accept TVs, computers, DVD players, monitors and cell phones. There is a $10 fee for TVs under 32", CRTS, monitors and laptops, but those who pay it will be given a $10 Best Buy gift card.<br>
<br>
For those interested in when and where the counties will be accepting hazardous wastes such as cleaning chemicals and bug sprays: The Missaukee County Hazardous Household Waste and Clean Sweep Collection is scheduled on September 26, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., at the Missaukee County Road Commission one mile north of Lake City on M-66. Note: This Clean Sweep event will also accept used cameras and calculators.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>For a fee of 40 cents a pound, Louis Padnos Iron & Metal Company will recycle used electronics - including TVs.<br>
<br>
"We don’t make money from doing this, but we are in the business of recycling, so it’s a service we like to offer to the community," said Karl Marcusse, company manager. "There’s stuff in those TVs that you really don’t want to be throwing in the landfill."<br>
<br>
Padnos said the fee was a result of recycling in North America, where the company is guaranteed a paper-trail showing that everything has been taken care of properly.<br>
<br>
According to Marcusse, recycling TVs can become very expensive. While a small TV might cost $5 to recycle, projection TVs weighing hundreds of pounds will cost significantly more. On average, Marcusse said that people generally spend about $20 to $30 to recycle their TVs.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Many news articles have been written or broadcasted on TV concerning the role distractions play in vechile safety. Yet we have observed school bus drivers talking on cell phones, eating fast food, drinking soft drinks and/or coffee, some not wearing seat belts and some smoking. What are the laws and rules concerning these issues?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 09/12/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to section 257.710e of the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code, bus drivers are not required to wear a seat belt. Cadillac Police Chief Jeff Hawke said that activities such as talking on cell phones, eating and/or drinking and smoking are governed by the policies of the employer.<br>
<br>
Schools employ bus drivers, and according to Manton Consolidated Schools superintendent Mark Parsons, who has worked at several school districts, most schools mandate that their bus drivers adhere to a general list of guidelines, which do not allow much room for distracted driving.<br>
<br>
"The only time they’re on cell phones is if there’s an emergency or if they’re calling ahead to find out if someone is riding - generally, if they make those calls, they stop," Parsons said. "They will use public address (PA) systems or another radio to call to dispatch if they need... The cell phone is not used much."<br>
<br>
Parsons also said Manton’s and many school-employed bus drivers are not allowed to smoke, consume food or drinks of any kind while on the job.<br>
<br>
"It’s for the safety of students that we adhere to those guidelines," said Parsons, noting that most schools use bus driver guidelines provided by the Michigan Association for Pupil Transportation.<br>
<br>
"I’ve been in several districts over my career, and those concerns (talking on cell phones, eating and/or drinking and smoking) that were raised are irregularities and are not the common practice," Parsons said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rick Wilson, project manager for Heritage Sustainable Energy, the company behind the McBain wind turbine project, said the supply chain to get new parts is a long one, stretching all the way to Europe.<br>

For one repair, the company needed to get a battery module that contained hazardous materials. The part was flown to Chicago, where it then encountered some delays through customs.<br>

"All the more reason to have these things made in the United States," Wilson said.<br>
<br>
Seven new wind turbines will be going up in the area, beginning this month. Wilson’s company now is going with a different company, known as REpower. The new supplier builds wind turbines with blades manufactured in Arkansas and towers built in Saskatchewan, Canada.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to the Michigan Department of Transportation in Cadillac, all the pedestrian signals should be working.<br>
<br>
However, due to ongoing construction, there may be interruptions in service, such as when the signals are switched from temporary to permanent wiring hookups, according to Del Kirkby then delivery engineer at MDOT in Cadillac.<br>
<br>
Pedestrian signals will be or are already installed at all signalized intersections within the construction limits of the downtown Cadillac project, he said. These new signals will indicate the approximate time remaining for pedestrians to cross by displaying a countdown timer of the pedestrian crossing interval.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I notice bicyclists at stop signs rarely use signals when turning. Has the city of Cadillac police ever given bicycle riders traffic tickets? How many in a year?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 08/22/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The hand signals for bicyclists are 1) Left turn: Hand and arm extended horizontally; 2) Right turn: Hand and arm extended upward; and 3) Stop or decrease speed: Hand and arm extended downward.<br>
<br>
But unfortunately, many motorists don’t readily recognize the hand signals, said Jeff Hawke, Cadillac Director of Public Safety.<br>
<br>
"Additionally, some cycling organizations promote using hand signals that differ from those outlined in the motor vehicle code," he added. "This also creates confusion for cyclists and motorists."<br>
<br>
Given these issues of signal misunderstandings, Hawke said the Cadillac Police Department prefers to take an educational approach regarding bicycle safety. For example, a list of bicycle safety recommendations and rules was recently published in the City of Cadillac News and Views Newsletter. In addition, the Cadillac Fire and Police Department partner with Wexford County Safe Kids to host the annual and upcoming Sept. 11 Child Safety Expo; the use of bike helmets is promoted at the event.<br>
<br>
Another area of concern regarding bicycles is the practice of riding on downtown sidewalks during the day and on the lake path, both of which are prohibited by city ordinance, Hawke said.<br>
<br>
"Riding in these areas greatly increases the likelihood of a collision with pedestrians," he said. "These types of violations are generally subject to enforcement action by summer bike patrol officers."</td><tr>

While there has not been a specific program to reassess all of Cadillac’s homes, assessors are in the process of looking at properties through the normal course of business.<br>
<br>
The State of Michigan has mandated that all local units of government use one year sales studies for the 2010 year. The dates are Oct. 1, 2008 through Sept. 30, 2009, and over the course of the cycle the values in Cadillac have decreased. As a result, homeowners should see a reduction in the assessed value.<br>

To paraphrase the article, it suggested that Cadillac (MI) was the coldest place in the nation and the warmest place in Michigan on the same day!

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 07/25/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover went to National Weather Service Meteorologist Jim Keysor to find the answer to this question. Keysor said it is possible that Cadillac, out of the major reporting stations, would have had the coldest reading in the country and the warmest temperature in Michigan in the same day. He went on to say that there were two instances in July 1950 where there was very cold temperatures. One of those instances was on July 1, 1950 when the low was 32 degrees and the other instance was on July 14, 1950 when the low was 34 degrees.<br>
<br>
The warmest temperature in 1950 was 87 degrees which occurred on July 11 and one of the biggest one-day spreads was on July 7 when the low was 38 degrees and the high was 82 degrees. Although the NWS does keep records, Keysor said it would be very hard to determine if Cadillac was the coldest place in the nation as well as the warmest in the state on the same day.<br>
<br>
"There is no way to go back that long ago and determine what was the warmest temperature in the state on a particular day or for that matter in the country. It would be very difficult to find now," he said. "There was a lot of extreme weather during 1950. Lots of records were broken and there was lots of cold weather across the country in 1950."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>One useful tool for diabled and handicapped individuals is "The Pump Guide," developed by the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America (MPVA) through a partnership with the members of the Michigan Petroleum Association.<br>
<br>
The Pump Guide lists more than 800 Michigan gas stations where "drivers who display a state-issued license plate or window placard identifying themselves as disabled are eligible for full pump service at self-serve pricing, as described in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)," explained the Web site, www.thepumpguide.com.<br>
<br>
The following stations in Wexford, Missaukee and Osceola counties voluntarily listed themselves for service to the handicapped. In most cases, handicapped drivers may either phone ahead for service or enter the gas stations, sound the horn and display the handicapped sign. An attendant will then be out to service you at no additional charge.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>We recently had our water shut off on our end of the street due to some repair work on the other end of the street. Is there a policy that says homeowners should be given notice, if feasible, the day before or a door to door notice the day of so we could have prepared for not having water?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/20/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Jeff Dietlin, utilities directors for the city of Cadillac, if the city schedules a water shut-off for a repair, the city notifies the people affected by the water shutdown at least 24 hours in advance.<br>
<br>
"Any (repair) that we know is coming up, we give residents notice," Dietlin said. "We know who’s going to be affected when we do a planned (repair) - we find out which valves to shut off and notify those people.<br>
<br>
"We usually post notices on the doors or go door to door and tell people - usually it’s a combination of both," he continued.<br>
<br>
However, if the city turns off the water due to an emergency, it shuts off the water immediately and thus doesn’t have time to alert neighbors, Dietlin said.<br>
<br>
While Dietlin said he’s unaware of how other local communities give notices to residents regarding water shut-offs, he said the city of Cadillac’s giving residents notice 24 prior to the water shut-off likely is common practice.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Before Frosty Cup burned and added their dining areas, was there ever access to Lake Cadillac between Frosty Cup and Burkes Waterfront Restaurant?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/20/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Jean Lamphere, who built the Frosty Cup with her husband in 1958 and whose family owned the property since the late 1800s, doesn’t recall any sort of public boating access ramp to Lake Cadillac before or after the fire, which occurred in 1977.<br>
<br>
Burke’s Waterfront owners also had no knowledge of an access ramp to Lake Cadillac on their side of the water.<br>
<br>
However, Lamphere said if people asked, her family let people use their property to park their cars and put their boats in the water.<br>
<br>
"We used to let people put their boat in there, but it wasn’t a public access (boat launch site)," Lamphere said. "Burke’s Waterfront, I think, was the same situation - it was all private property."<br>
<br>
Wexford County Sheriff Gary Finstrom, who’s the nephew of Lamphere, remembers people "dragging a boat or carrying a canoe down to the lake and putting it in the water."<br>
<br>
But like his aunt, Finstrom said, "If it’s their assumption that there was a boat ramp, there was never anything like that."<br>
<br>
According to Lamphere, before the state redid the causeway near the Marina Restaurant and Burke’s Waterfront, there was a tunnel that travelled underneath the bridge, allowing access between the main Lake Cadillac and the water by Burke’s Waterfront and Frosty Cup.<br>
<br>
"If people had a small boat, they could go underneath it to get to the water by Burke’s Waterfront and Frosty Cup," said Lamphere, who was unaware of when the state installed the causeway.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the only way to access the water by Frosty Cup was by private permission or cruising underneath the bridge.<br>
<br>
Lamphere and her husband sold the Frosty Cup in 1990.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/13/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>"Razzasque Days," the name of the town of LeRoy’s July celebration, has been puzzling locals and visitors alike for years.<br>
<br>
Stacie Dvonch, president of Razzasque Days, said the answer is still murky.<br>
<br>
"Over the years people have tried to figure it out, but even the historical society has said it doesn’t know," Dvonch said.<br>
<br>
The rumor is that local lumbermen came up with a nonsense word and passed it off as French.<br>
<br>
The festival had its beginnings in the early 1900’s, dreamed up by a group of lumber company owners, Dvonch said.<br>
<br>
The festival gave folks in and around the LeRoy area something to do during the summer lull in the logging operation.<br>
<br>
Razzasque Days was discontinued in 1915, but was reinstated for LeRoy’s centennial in 1973 and was a big hit, so it was continued. The event has now been running steadily for 36 years, and this year it will be held Friday and Saturday, July 10 and 11. For the first time in its history, it will feature a carnival with rides. Other events include a parade, health and wellness fair, chicken barbecue, and tournaments in horseshoes, softball, sport (cup) stacking, dodgeball and arm wrestling.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I was in Cadillac and the Meijer gas station had gas for $2.88 a gallon. When going through Greenville, gas at Meijer was $2.71 a gallon. Why are the prices so different when it is the same company owned gas station?"</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/13/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Frank Guglielmi, director of public relations for Meijer, retailers like Meijer purchase fuel from wholesalers.<br>
<br>
There are several factors that influence the cost they pay, including which particular wholesaler they are purchasing from from where the gasoline is shipped.<br>
<br>
Geography plays a role in the cost, too. If the fuel has to be shipped from a long distance, that can affect the cost. Greenville and Cadillac are a good distance away from each other, and Meijer uses a different gasoline supplier for those two stores, due to their locations. Meijer says the bottom line is they always try to match the lowest price in the market where gas stations are located.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I came into the Cadillac News building the other day and really enjoyed the architecture. What’s the origin of the building?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/13/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'> The Romanesque-style office building, which was designed by Chicago architect H. H. Waterman, was first occupied in 1909 by the Cummer-Diggins Lumber Co.<br>
<br>
And since 1936, the building has been occupied by the Cadillac Evening News, now titled the Cadillac News.<br>
<br>
According to a 1909 news report, the building "is one of the most beautiful... in this part of the country."<br>
<br>
The main entry to the building is set off by granite pillars. Six lion heads support the second floor windows. Cream-colored-face bricks rest on a base of polished granite.<br>
<br>
A green tiled roof crowns the downtown Cadillac building.<br>
<br>
When you walk through the front doors, inside you see a marble-floored, hexagonal rotunda with carved oak pillars and a stained glass skylight. You also find extensive use of quarter-sawed oak woodwork, all befitting its early history as the home of one of Michigan’s largest and most prominent lumber companies.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I noticed all the tent worms on trees and was wondering if they are a detriment to the tree? How harmful are they?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 05/30/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover has noticed the tent worms too and decided to call Jill O’Donnell at the Wexford County Michigan State Extension.<br>
<br>
O’Donnell said this is the second year of high levels for the tent worms and that it usually last between three and five years before it returns to normal levels.<br>
<br>
O’Donnell also said that there are probably two types of worms people are seeing: the Eastern Tent Caterpillar while the second is the Forest Tent Caterpillar.<br>
<br>
Eastern Tent Caterpillars feed mostly on wild or ‘scrub’ cherry trees growing throughout the country in old fields, on the edges of woodlots or along the roadside, but will occasionally lay eggs and nest on landscape and cultivated fruit trees in home orchards.<br>
<br>
The Eastern Tent Caterpillar makes its nest in the fork of branches. The caterpillar has several different markings and colors on them, but the most revealing characteristic is a solid, white-to-yellow stripe that runs down the center or back of the caterpillar when full grown.<br>
<br>
The damage to trees can occasionally be severe - especially if a single cherry tree is infested by several colonies or tents.<br>
<br>
These hairy caterpillars feed on foliage in and around the tent during the day and usually return to the colony at night.<br>
<br>
At first, both the caterpillars and tents are small in size. However, as feeding continues, both the caterpillars and silken tents get larger in size. The caterpillars usually mature in the first part of June.<br>
<br>
Eastern Tent Caterpillar larvae are prey for other insects, toads, and birds.<br>
<br>
Many caterpillars die from disease during unfavorable weather. Homeowners can either prune out or destroy the tents by crushing the caterpillars, dropping them into a pan of soapy water or apply an insecticide to the nests and about one foot of the surrounding branches or trunk. If possible, make applications early in the morning when the caterpillars are generally congregating on their nests.<br>
<br>
Forest Tent Caterpillar is similar in habit and appearance to Eastern Tent Caterpillars. Full-grown caterpillars are about two inches long, mostly blue and black, with a row of white, key-hole shaped markings on their backs, and many hairs along the edge of the body.<br>
<br>
Forest Tent Caterpillars do not build nests but leave mats of silken threads on trees where they travel or rest. Their favorite hosts are oak, maple, poplar and birch trees.<br>
<br>
The long-term affects of forest tent caterpillar on forest trees are usually not serious and trees rarely are killed by this insect. However, trees already under stress from other factors like drought, poor growing conditions, old age, etc may die.<br>
<br>
Spraying to control the caterpillars is rarely necessary. Occasionally individual shade and landscape trees may require treatment during outbreaks. Identify the trees in your yard you want to protect. Biological insecticides like B.T. are a safe, effective option. Chemical sprays can be costly and often kill natural enemies that are responsible for eventually bringing the insect under control.<br>
<br>
Later in June, mature larvae of both these caterpillars can become a nuisance when they wander to find a place to pupate and their search takes them to nearby buildings and yards.<br>
<br>
They do not bite people or harm animals or property, but they can be very annoying when large numbers are found crawling or clustering on building walls, lawns, and sidewalks.<br>
<br>
Dealing with tent caterpillars can be very frustrating for homeowners, try to remember this will be over in mid to late June. </td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Do you have any info on the bullying event that was held at the Kalkaska middle school?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 05/30/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>To find the answer to this question Rover contacted Kalkaska Middle School Counselor Rebecca Kik. Kik said bullying is everywhere, in every school, in every town and no one is immune to this type of behavior. As the middle school counselor, Kik teamed up with Dee Miller from the MSU Extension and put together a half-day workshop for the school. The goal was to create a greater awareness of what is acceptable and what is not when dealing with a bullying situation.<br>
<br>
During the event, Kik said many students expressed that it is happening all around them, but the problem is that many of them don’t know what to do about it.<br>
<br>
The workshop gave the students tools to deal with the issue. Some examples - students were told to get a group of friends together and tell an adult, play along with the words they are using to hurt you, use humor or smart comebacks that won’t make the situation worse but gets your point across. Tell a trusted adult, someone who you know will handle the situation and not just say ‘OK, I’ll see what I can do’ and do nothing. Or put together a project where the entire school is involved about character and what we want to see in our school.<br>
<br>
A pilot group was started with the National Junior Honors Society, Builder’s Club and Student Council.<br>
<br>
Since it was a success, the school decided to offer it to the entire schoool. Kik also will be teaching a Character Education class for the entire sixth grade next year. </td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Most schools in northern Michigan were awarded state land many years ago, according to Manton Supertindent J.

If the land was to be used for something other than its original use or someone tried to sell it, Parsons said it must revert back to the state. With the advent of alternative energy such as wind power, Parsons said the district has been seeking ways to use the property.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Rick Liptak, transportation and service center manager for Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in Cadillac, the reason Mitchell Street in Cadillac is in rough shape simply is because "it’s old."<br>
<br>
"The road is quite old and has not had major reconstruction in a long time," Liptak said. "The bricks that you’re seeing now is the old, original road from the 1900s."<br>
<br>
The potholes are thanks to Mother Nature, which are mainly due to the area’s multiple freeze/thaw cycles during the cold weather season, each of which weaken an older pavement.<br>
<br>
"We’re getting to a point where we’re letting the road age, because we know we’re going to be rebuilding it in a couple years," Liptak said. "We’re trying to get maximum life out of pavement."<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Browsing through the Cadillac News community calendar and seeking out area organizations, Rover found several activities for children under age 3.<br>
<br>
From 11 to 11:30 a.m. on the second Saturday of each month, Horizon Books in downtown Cadillac hosts a story time with Mary Dillon, and at 10 a.m. every Thursday, the Missaukee District Library on South Canal Street in Lake City has a story time with puzzles and playtime included.<br>
<br>
Another fun, interactive option for toddlers and their parents is Kindermusik with Melinda Lise, which takes place at St. Ann in Cadillac. According to the program’s Web site, http://musicwithmelinda.kindermusik.net, the Kindermusik Village class "incorporates the most current research on early childhood development and provides families a special place for learning and connecting with other parents and babies through music and movement." The Kindermusik Our Time class helps children build their language skills through singing, imitating sounds, rhyming and identifying objects. Children also are encouraged to move to different music to develop their sense of balance, timing and spatial awareness. All these in turn help children’s social skills to evolve. For more information on Kindermusik, visit the website or call Melinda at 631-7751.<br>
<br>
The Cadillac Area YMCA also offers different classes for toddlers and their parents. One, shrimp swimming, for children ages 6 to 18 months, introduces children to water and teaches about basic water safety. The next step up, perch swimming, for ages 19 months to 3 years old, teaches children to move more independently in the water, while parents learn about aquatic and boating safety. Children in that class also enjoy playing with toys and flotation devices. Another class offered is parent-child gymnastics, for ages 18 to 41 months. The YMCA offers financial assistance programs to those who qualify. For more information on the YMCA, visit their Web site at www.cadillacareaymca.org or call 775-3369.<br>

Who is in charge of them and were they tested before putting out on display?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 05/02/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cadillac City Parks Superintendent Al Dumond said the snowflakes were originally made by the Wexford-Missaukee Career Tech Center for the Cadillac Area Chamber of Commerce several years ago.<br>
<br>
When the city started to light up the lake front during the holiday season, there were deer, angels and snowflakes. Now only the snowflakes are in use as the deer and angels fell into disrepair.<br>
<br>
Every year, Dumond said the snowflakes the city checks to make sure the lights are working - if they are not, new lights are strung on them. He also said various factors could have led to the lights not working as well as the fact that a full-time parks crew is not working during the winter months.<br>
<br>
"We check them before we put them out but due to vandalism, extreme weather or moisture getting into them, things happen," Dumond said. "Next year we will turn them on and string them if they need it before we put them out."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>The City of Cadillac allowed the Meadowland Apartments to be built in a "wet-land" area and then a drainage culvert was constructed under the road to allow water to flow into an existing drainage ditch that runs over and along Holly Road. During a storm earlier this year, several homes were flooded in the Barbara Street/Petrie Street area. What has the City of Cadillac done to remedy the situation so it won’t happen in the future?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 05/02/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Cadillac Community Development Coordinator Jerry AdamNorthland Meadow Apartments are located on an approximate 21-acre site, east of Hector Road.<br>
<br>
The site contains a mix of upland and wetland areas. A majority of the wetlands are found in the southern portion of the parcel. In addition to their wildlife and water filtration benefits, the site’s wetlands serve as natural detention areas for the on-site management of storm water, Adams said.<br>
<br>
Regulated wetlands are governed by Part 303, Wetlands Protection, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 Public Act 451, as amended<br>
<br>
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality administers the Act. Construction in a regulated wetland is normally prohibited unless a comprehensive and stringent mitigation plan (wetland replacement plan) is approved by the MDEQ, he said.<br>
<br>
Prior to preparing their final site design plan, the developers of Northland Meadows retained a professional wetland’s consultant to identify and map the parcel’s regulated wetlands. The consultant’s findings were subject to MDEQ review and approval and were used by project designers to locate buildings and infrastructure.<br>
<br>
Buildings and interior streets were placed in upland locations in order to avoid disruption of the regulated wetlands, Adams said. That is why one finds a majority of the development located toward the northern portion of the site. That area is upland in character.<br>
<br>
The project did not involve the construction of a drainage culvert linking to the existing ditch that runs over and along Holly Road. The development employs use of the on-site wetlands for the management of storm water.</td><tr>

<br>
In the bigger picture, as technologies develop, hopefully parts of turbines and solar panels will be manufactured locally.<br>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/11/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Michigan’s initial payment from the tobacco industry was $104.5 million, to be followed by $279 to $365 million annually for 24 years. Currently, Michigan has received $2.6 billion since 1999, according to Terry Stanton of the Department of Treasurey for the state of Michigan.<br>
<br>
Michigan policy makers enacted legislation allocating 75 percent of the tobacco-settlement funds to support the Michigan Merit Award program, a fund providing college scholarships to high school students who do well on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program test. The remaining 25 percent goes into the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund, which supports a variety of programs, including a prescription-drug program for seniors and various health programs and research efforts.<br>
<br>
In 2008, the state received $290.2 million, one third of which was used on health-related programming, Stanton said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The ordinance is still being reviewed for consideration by the Wexford County Board of Commissioners sometime in April, said board chairman Mike Stump.<br>
<br>
The process has hit some snags due to the abundance of state and federal land in Wexford County. The U.S. Forest Service owns hundreds of small portions of roads in southwestern Wexford County.<br>
<br>
Because ORVs are prohibited on forest service roads, in order for fluid passage through that portion of the county to be possible, the roads would have to be vacated by the USFS.<br>
<br>
The process of vacating the roads takes three years or so, USFS Assistant Ranger John Hojnowksi said.<br>
<br>
In the northern portion of the county, townships are discussing their options with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The DNR hopes to work together to connect open trails with open roads, as opposed to opening all county roads in Wexford County.<br>

Given the fact that townships can develop their own ORV ordinances, the county could potentially have numerous ordinances with different rules for each.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why can’t I view PBS on TV? I’ve only heard the station is working on it. What caused the problem, and when will it be up and running again?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/21/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>A few weeks ago, the Central Michigan University Public Broadcasting System suffered a massive transmitter failure, explained Rick Schudiske, Director of Television.<br>
<br>
After looking into the problem, the damage was too extensive to repair. A tube containing an oil-antifreeze-like material burst, spraying all of the sensitive equipment within the transmitter. Fixing the damage would have not only have been prohibitively expensive, but also dangerous.<br>
<br>
With digital conversion looming, the station made the decision to forego repairs as all analogue signals will be shut down at noon Tuesday, March 31.<br>
<br>
"It would have taken a long time and a lot of money to fix, and wouldn’t have gotten it done before the March 31 shut off," he said. "A lot of thought was given to the situation, but it didn’t make sense for time, safety or cost."<br>
<br>
Fortunately, PBS has begun digital transmission, so Schudiske recommends effected households hook up digital broadcast converter boxes to continue receiving PBS programming.</td><tr>

<br>
However, if you feel that the value of your home is significantly lower than your assessed value, a little research and an appearance with your local Board of Review may help sort it out.<br>
<br>
The data tax assessors must use ends Sept. 30, 2008. "We are behind the market, we have a lag in the data we are allowed to use by the state," Whetstone explained. "But, a lot has happened between September and now in our area."<br>
<br>
Because the Board of Review has final control of the assessing, appearing before the board may help bridge that gap, Whetstone said.<br>
<br>
To prepare for the board, homeowners may bring a recent appraisal on their property if available, and should verify that their record card accurately represents their home.<br>
<br>
"The city of Cadillac Board of Review looks at all the data that comes before them," Whetstone said. "Sometimes it’s only a matter of checking."<br>
<br>
The board may direct tax assessors to visit the house to verify the class or look for other discrepancies - such as the home listed as having a basement, when in fact has a crawl space.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>What is the correct way to stop at the four way stop in Ashton, before the stop sign or after?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/14/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'> Justin Halladay, Undersheriff of Osceola County, referred Rover to the Michigan Complied Laws - Motor Vehicle Code Book. Section 257.649 (6) states: Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, the driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is not a crosswalk shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; or if there is not a crosswalk or clearly marked stop line, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadwayAfter having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to a vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver would be moving across or within the intersection.<br>
<br>
"The bottom line is," Halladay stated, "the law does not say drivers have to stop at or behind the stop sigitself; it states that drivers have to stop at the intersection that the stop sign marks. Because there is not a clearly defined crosswalk or stop line at the Ashton intersection, the driver then has to, as stated in the above law, stop at the nearest point where he has a clear view of all approaching traffic."</td><tr>

</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/14/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Michigan lawmakers have been approached with the possibility of expanding the state bottle law at various occasions, but the most recent bill to pass in 1998 did not include the expansion - only regulations to help deter bottle return fraud.<br>
<br>
Arguments exist for both sides of the bottle expansion.<br>
<br>
The Michigan Environmental Council calls for the inclusion of all beverage containers in order to help litter, keep the plastics from landfills and encourage recycling overall. With 750 million beverages in non-returnable containers sold each year, they currently find their home on the sides of roads or landfills.<br>
<br>
The Michigan Recycling Partnership (MRP) opposes the expansion, citing increased costs to consumers with 10-cent deposits on milk, juice, water, tea, sport drinks, and alcohol containers in one gallon size and under. They also expect increased costs to grocers for having to handle the larger quantity of returns, which they believe will be passed on to the consumer.<br>
<br>
"You should not have to pay a higher price for these items, especially when many of these containers are already recyclable through drop off collection programs," argues the MRP.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/07/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Whenever archeologist John Davis of the National Forest Service is asked which tribe lived in the Cadillac area, he can’t give a specific answer. The best description is broad - there were no major settlements, but those that moved through were Central Algonquin speakers. While it is a broad description that covers many groups, it fits because this area of Michigan was more of a "seasonal hunting, family group area," Davis described.<br>
<br>
It is likely that several different groups continuously travelled through and moved on.<br>
<br>
Alexander Henry, a Frenchman who travelled with an native American family for a winter published a narrative of his experiences. In the work, it is believed that while he was in the area, he stumbled upon Lake Mitchell. (It also may have been Lake Cadillac, Lake Missuakee or Houghton Lake.) The immediate area was uninhabited, and the family Henry travelled with was trapping for furs to trade and moving on.<br>
<br>
Davis believes this was likely an accurate representation for this part of Michigan.<br>
<br>
It could be said that the area was mainly Ottawa-Chippewa, or the "people of three fires," but Davis reiterated that a specific group can’t really be identified.<br>
<br>
"In this historical period, there is very little known," Davis said. While there are archeological sites, "With the British and the French, everybody was disjointed and moving around during the 1600s and 1700s," he explained.</td><tr>

Larry Davy, owner of the PBS Marathon Gas Station in Cadillac, said he considered using E85, but there is not enough demand to meet the investment needed to begin selling the fuel.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The majority of the advertising spending - $1.2 billion - is being spent by the broadcasting industry itself, lead by the National Association of Broadcasters, according to NAB spokesperson Shermaze Ingram.<br>
<br>
"It’s considered the largest consumer education campaign in television history," Ingram said.<br>
<br>
The federal government and other industry groups also are doing their part.<br>
<br>
FCC spokeswoman Rosemary Kimball said the FCC has spent about $20 million on its own for education.<br>
<br>
And if you received a converter box coupon in the mail and are wondering where the money came to pay for the boxes, Kimball said the government received about $20 billion when it was able to auction off parts of the electromagnetic spectrum freed up by the conversion to digital television. This is a result of the fact that the digital TV signals use less of the spectrum than the analog signals did.<br>
<br>
So the government received $20 billion in the auction but so far has spent only $1.5 billion for the converter boxes.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>A friend of mine was ticketed for picking up Petoskey stones on a beach. Is that illegal?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/21/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Under Title 36, Part II in the Code of Federal Regulations, the rules are laid out for National Park Service lands. The rules state that collecting, possessing or removing park resources in national parks is prohibited. Rocks fall under the resource category.<br>
<br>
Rules can be altered for specific national parks. For example, some parks allow hunting.<br>
<br>
On state land, rules differ.<br>
<br>
"In our state parks along Lake Michigan, we prefer that you leave things as you found them so everyone can enjoy them," Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Mary Dettloff said. "We don’t ticket people. I think, though, there is no state law that governs other public beaches."<br>
<br>
The same is true for the U.S. Forest Service. Spokeswoman Carol Nilsson said the forest service does not want driftwood removed from federal forest service beaches. There also are some campfire restrictions.<br>
<br>
As for picking up stones, Nilsson said there’s no rule saying it’s illegal.<br>
<br>
Kevin Gauthier, owner of the Korner Gem in Traverse City and co-author of "Lake Huron Rock Picker’s Guide," said people should be cautious when collecting Petoskey stones.<br>
<br>
The Sand Dunes federal area is very strict on the rules, Gauthier said. The state informed a friend of Gauthier’s that commercial collecting on state beaches also was prohibited.<br>
<br>
"It kind of depends on who you run into and what they consider commercial collecting," Gauthier said.<br>
<br>
A tourist picking up a Petoskey stone probably won’t run into any problems, he said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>One year, I noticed that the lights on the Shay Locomotive in Cadillac’s City Park made the wheels look like they were going around, but the last couple of years they haven’t. What happened to those lights?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/21/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The lights on the Shay Locomotive’s wheels never looked as if they were going around in a circular motion, however, the wheels sported twinkling lights for a couple years. Now, the city uses rope lights, which do not blink.<br>
<br>
Al Dumond, parks and cemetery superintendent for the city of Cadillac, said the reason the city switched from twinkle lights to rope lights is because the rope lights are higher quality and last longer.<br>
<br>
"With the twinkle lights, when one goes out, they all go out - but with the rope lights, if one goes, they don’t all go," Dumond said. The other reason the city switched to the rope lights is because they’re easier to display, compared to the twinkle lights, which required people to staple the lights to pieces of plywood.<br>
<br>
Dumond said people shouldn’t expect flashing lights in the future.<br>
<br>
"We are going to leave it at the rope lights," he said. "We think that does the job."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The 211 project for Wexford County is being headed by the Cadillac Area Chamber of Commerce Leadership Class, explained Leadership Class participant Tara Veddler.<br>
<br>
"The 211 system is a health and human service line, similar to the 911 program," Veddler explained. "You can call the number and get information and referrals on food, clothing, housing, youth programs, child and family program, elder care and more."<br>
<br>
The Leadership Class is currently compiling a database of all of the programs and services available in the county, Veddler explained. They hope to have the database complete and a 1-800 number available by June.<br>
<br>
"It’s hard to go to a phonebook at say ˜I need food, where do I go?" Veddler said. The 211 number would connect individuals with that information 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.<br>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/07/2009</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Yes, motorists may be pulled over if their vehicle registration plate is obscured by snow, according to Cadillac Police Chief Jeff Hawke.<br>
<br>
Section 257.225" of the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code states, "The plate shall be maintained free from foreign materials that obscure or partially obscure the registration information and in a clearly legible condition."<br>
<br>
However, the decision to issue a ticket or warning is based on the discretion of the police officer.<br>
<br>
"Many times, officers will simply make the driver aware that the license plate is obscured without issuing a ticket," Hawke said.<br>
<br>
Police recommend that drivers make cleaning their license plates part of their regular routine when clearing snow from the vehicle windshield, mirrors and windows.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>It is possible to receive all of the local stations digitally through a regular TV antenna, however if the antenna is not directed in the proper direction, or isn’t of a high enough quality the signal will not be received, Bob Schultz of ABC Warehouse explained<br>
<br>
"Depending on the type of antenna you have, you will get more or less signals," Schultz explained. "The better your antenna, the better signal you are going to get - but you still have to have it directed properly."<br>
<br>
ABC, NBC and Fox all transmit from Kalkaska, so homeowners will need to redirect their outdoor antennas in that direction, Schultz said.<br>
<br>
If your home uses an indoor "rabbit ear" antenna and isn’t receiving a signal, Schultz warned that it likely will not get signals for the stations no matter how it is directed.<br>
<br>
"With a digital signal, you either get it or you don’t. If you are getting no signal, then your antenna is not getting a signal," he said.</td><tr>

How long has CAPS kept the same bus schedule? Is it not worth looking into having the elementary students start a little earlier (even a half hour would make a difference). My child is up and ready to get to work by 8:10 a.m. yet he does not start his schooling until 8:50 a.m. and he does not get home from school until close to 5 p.m. When he does get home he is exhausted.

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The start time for the different levels of Cadillac Area Public Schools is determined by the size of the district - the larger number of students require a two-tiered busing system, and the accommodation of student athletics at the middle school, junior high and high school levels.<br>
<br>
Superintendent Paul Liabenow explained that the possibility of having the elementary students begin school earlier is being investigated at Kenwood Elementary School at the behest of a parent request. He encouraged any parents with additional concerns to contact him directly.<br>

Another donation option is the The Habitat Restore in Cadillac. They will accept donations of complete, functioning computer systems, and donors can receive a tax deductible receipt in return, Lori Bowen explained.<br>
<br>
Cadillac Area Public Schools also will accept donations of computer equipment and printers, but "they have to be compatible with our systems to be able to work with our network," explained Mary Jo Blackmer of the assistant superintendent’s office.<br>
<br>
Regular desktop printers, because they cannot be connected to the network, should be donated elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If you have computer equipment to donate to the schools, the first step is to contact Assistant Superintendent Pat Briggs at Cadillac Public Schools Central Office. From there, it will be arranged to evaluate the equipment to see if it would be compatible with the school.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>It’s probably an unknown dilemma," explained First Night organizer Carla Filkins. "The place that we have found near the historical museum is a perfect spot for the clarity of the picture."<br>
<br>
All of the elements from the angle of the sun to clearance for the elevation of the photographer combine to produce a picture where all of the faces can be seen very crisply and clearly, without too much darkness or overexposure.<br>
<br>
"This year it was our desire to move the picture," Filkins said.<br>
<br>
The organizers hoped to hold it at Mercy Hospital in celebration of their 100 year anniversary, but in the end, because of the location in relation to the sun, the picture wouldn’t work.<br>
<br>
The hunt for alternate locations continued, but a solution couldn’t be found.<br>
<br>
"We’d love to do it downtown, but we can’t shut down traffic," she said. "Also, the fire engine has to get in there, with the lift going up without getting into wires."<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Official weather data for Wexford County is recorded at the National Weather Service (NWS) in Gaylord, explained meterologist Scott Rozanski of the NWS.<br>
<br>
The NWS has volunteer weather observers in nearly every county in Michigan - Wexford County’s weather observer is located near downtown Cadillac, Rozanski said.<br>
<br>
Each day between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., the weather observer will go to the designated location with a 2’ by 2’ white board called a snowboard. The weather observer will then measure both snowfall and snow depth in multiple areas and take an average of the results.<br>
<br>
Snowfall is measured in 0.1 of an inch, and snow depth is rounded to the nearest inch.<br>
<br>
"They take the snowfall data and send it to the weather service, and that becomes the official record for the entire county," Rozanski explained. "That record determines the climate for that area for the long term."<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Every year, the city puts up a tent for the snowmobile festival; but why didn’t the city put up a pole building years ago at the edge of Lake Cadillac so that snowmobile clubs can use it in the winter and people could rent kayaks in the summer?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 12/06/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>There are numerous differences between the snowmobile festival tent and a permanent pole barn structure on the lake front, which appears to make it a bad fit for the city, said Precia L. Garland, Assistant City Manager/DDA Director for Cadillac.<br>
<br>
"The tent is erected on the ice," she said. "While it is possible to construct a permanent structure over water (ice), it is not practicable, nor would the public or MDNR allow it."<br>
<br>
A tent is also considered a temporary structure and not rigid construction; standards of a permanent building would need to follow. Also, a tent’s size can be adjusted to accommodate planned activities, she said.<br>
<br>
"There is a certain ambiance associated with the use of a tent," Garland said. "A tent conveys an outdoor presence consistent with the atmosphere of the snowmobile festival."<br>
<br>
Except for Kenwood Park, there is no city-owned site by the lake large enough to efficiently accommodate the needs of a snowmobile club: snowmobile parking, automobile/truck parking, trailer parking, restrooms, driveways and maneuvering areas, etc.<br>
<br>
"Kenwood Park is not considered an appropriate location due to its existing development and programmed uses," she said.<br>
<br>
"Several of the area’s hotels, motels, and resorts provide space and staging areas for snowmobile groups throughout the winter months," Garland said. "The livelihood of these businesses is heavily dependent on the attraction and accommodation of these groups. The construction of a city-owned and operated structure for wintertime use by snowmobile clubs has the potential to negatively impact private businesses. Similarly, should the city pursue the rental of kayaks and other small watercraft, it would be competing with several area businesses that currently provide this service."</td><tr>

Stoddard called 911, and one half-hour later, the dog catcher showed up and took the dog to Wexford County Animal Shelter.<br>
<br>
The female beagle broke into Stoddard’s home by chewing off the outside tin of the sliding, glass door; the dog then rammed her paws against and chewed the wood on the door. The door was soon off its runner, and the dog ran through the kitchen, dining room, living room and found Stoddard’s open bedroom door and jumped into bed with her.<br>
<br>
Soon after the incident, the beagle was claimed by her Manton owner, according to Wexford County Animal Shelter records.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Are there any plans in the works for installing sidewalks along Cobb Street and Carmel Street?"  With doctors offices, Health Department, Community Mental Health, the Sheriff’s Office, as well as other offices in the area, quite often there are people walking on the roadway. This is dangerous, especially in the upcoming winter. Does the City of Cadillac have any plans in the works for pedestrian safety?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 10/18/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>City of Cadillac Engineer Bruce DeWitt said at this point there are no plans to install sidewalks along that section of streets. DeWitt said there have been no requests from neighbors, property owners or the general public as well as no request for a special assessment.<br>
<br>
In terms of pedestrian safety, Cadillac Director of Public Safety Jeff Hawke said the city of Cadillac continues to focus on pedestrian safety. The 2009 Mitchell Street project will include design features targeting pedestrian safety." Safety features include planned intersection "bump outs" to reduce the physical distance of the crosswalk." Reducing the physical distance of the crosswalk reduces the time that pedestrians are in the street, Hawke explained.<br>
<br>
Additionally, Hawke said the project will include bold crosswalk markings." The markings are more visible to both pedestrians and drivers." ADA compliant pavement features will also be included to assist persons with vision impairments." The raised truncated domes in the pavement allow visually impaired pedestrians to "feel" when they have arrived at an intersection.<br>
<br>
The city of Cadillac has long been focused on pedestrian safety. One of the best solutions is to provide non-motorized walking routes, Hawke said. The city of Cadillac boasts many miles of neighborhood sidewalks. Also, the Keith McKellop Lakefront Walk combined with more than seven miles of bike path around Lake Cadillac has enhanced pedestrian safety. Hawke said the completion of the Clam River Greenway project adds another 1.6 miles of non-motorized walking trail area.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Whose idea was it to put the sign in front of the pavilion in Cadillac? Was it a concern that it may detract from the natural beauty of the lakefront?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 10/11/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The sign in front of the pavilion was a joint contribution to the community from the Cadillac Community Foundation and the city of Cadillac<br>
<br>
"We had felt for a long time that there were a lot of questions and general curiosity about events taking place at the pavilion," explained Linda Kimbel, executive director of the Cadillac Community Foundation.<br>
<br>
Seeing this need, the community foundation set to work to create a sign that could display upcoming events. Kimbel explained that in designing the sign, it was important to have a lighted sign, visible on both sides, with large enough lettering to read while driving past.<br>
<br>
The design aesthetic correlates with the other blue and white signs that have been used throughout the city.<br>
<br>
After nearly a full year of effort, the community foundation donated $5,000 toward the sign, aided by an additional $1,000 from the city, which made sure the sign was installed properly and placed in the right location.<br>
<br>
"The sign helps to promote community events to locals and tourists," Kimbel said. "We’re trying to point out that the natural beauty of the lake front is there for everyone to enjoy."</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 10/11/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The trees on Boon Road were removed after a state inspection of the Wexford County Airport in September. Airport Manager Mike Pacola explained that the tops of the trees were encroaching on the right of way for the planes. "We have to maintain a 20 to 1 glide slope, and the tops of the trees were getting too close," he said.<br>
<br>
If the trees were to grow too high, airplanes taking off and landing at the airport may risk running into them, and overall, they decrease visability for the pilots.<br>
<br>
Beginning Sept. 17, between 170 and 180 trees were removed. In the spring, the Wexford County Airport Authority plans on replanting a shorter species of tree, possibly ornimental pear trees, Pacola said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>You often see the title of "Dr." (such as Dr. and Mrs. Smith) but you do not see other noble titles listed with names, such as judge, sheriff, mayor, attorney. Why would just the one profession be selected when others also require a lot of education and respect?

</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 10/11/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Cadillac News is among the many newspapers nationwide that follow the "Associated Press Stylebook." As stated in the rules of the "Associated Press" 2008 Stylebook" edition, in general, confine capitalization to formal titles used directly before an individual’s name (ex: Cadillac Area Public Schools Superintendent Paul Liabenow;" Osceola County Sheriff James Crawford; city of Cadillac Mayor Bill Barnett;" District Court Judge David Hogg). WHEN TO USE LOWERCASE TITLES: Lowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with an individual’s name (ex: The Cadillac superintendent issued a statement; the sheriff arrested the man; Cadillac mayor Bill Barnett voted no; the man told judge Hoag he was guilty). Lowercase and spell out titles in constructions that set the off from a name by commas (ex: The Cadillac Area Public School superintendent, Paul Liabenow, declined to run again;" Osceola sheriff, James Crawford, signed the document.). Other titles serve primarily as occupational descriptions (ex: attorney David McCurdy; the only time attorneys are capitalized is if they have an officeholder’s title: District Attorney Hamilton Burger)." <br>
<br>
From the AP Stylebook: The title "Dr." may be used on first reference before the names of individuals who holds a doctor of dental surgery, doctor of medicine, doctor of optometry, doctor of osteopathy or doctor of podiatric medicine degree. If appropriate in the context, "Dr." also may be used on first reference before the names of individuals who hold other types of doctoral degrees. however, because the public frequently identified Dr. only with physicians, care should be taken to ensure that the individual’s speciality is stated in first or second reference.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 09/06/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Bob Felt, North Communications Representative for MDOT, what time the lights blink is based on volume of traffic. Currently, MDOT is in the midst of a region-wide project that will change traffic signals across Michigan; the blinking lights are part of that project. Since downtown Cadillac has little traffic later at night, the lights have been reprogrammed to blink earlier.<br>
<br>
The changes also reach outside of the Cadillac area. As part of the project, one signal in Houghton Lake will soon be removed entirely.<br>
<br>
The results of the changes will continue to be monitored. "If things down the road say we need to change (the signals), then we will," Felt said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>If the handicapped parking space in the private complex is properly marked, police can ticket vehicles improperly using the space, according to Capt. Matt Wohlfeill of the Cadillac Police Department.<br>

"If we get a call to come on property by residents or management, we can enforce the violation "­- but the space has be properly signed," Wohlfeill said.<br>

An official handicapped parking spot must be marked with a sign on a post at around eye level. Handicapped spots marked only on pavement are not valid, said Wohlfeill. "If it’s only marked on pavement, that is not considered proper marking, and we can’t enforce it," he explained.<br>

Tickets for improperly parking in handicapped spots will earn violators a $50 ticket.</td><tr>

<br>
The baskets, purchased from Holstege Greenhouse in Grand Rapids, are actually the same size as last year. The baskets themselves are a reusable plastic basket, unlike the former fiber basket that were disposed of at the end of each year. The visible difference is actually the type of flower planted.

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 07/05/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Attorney General’s Office for the State of Michigan explained that illegal fireworks used without a permit are illegal for sale, use, or transportation without a permit. Violators are guilty of a misdemeanor.<br>
<br>
Examples of illegal fireworks/explosives in Michigan:<br>
<br>
(This list is not all-inclusive.)<br>
<br>
• Cherry Bomb - A small red sphere approximately 1" in diameter.<br>
<br>
• Comet (or Mine) - A cylinder containing a star and attached to a wooden base. Upon ignition, the star is thrust 50-100 feet in the air and continues to glow as it falls to the ground.<br>
<br>
• Firecracker - A small noisemaking cylinder up to 1.5" in length, often strung together with a fuse.<br>
<br>
• M-80 - Up to 2" in length, usually a red cylinder with a fuse coming out the side. This is not a firework; it is a federally banned explosive.<br>
<br>
• Bottle Rockets - A cylinder, frequently topped by a cone to stabilize its flight, attached to a long stick.<br>
<br>
• Roman Candles - A 6-12" tube containing alternating layers of compacted black powder that shoots single stars out of the top when lighted.<br>
<br>
• Silver Salute (M-100) - A silver cylinder with a fuse coming out of the side containing large quantities of flash powder. This is not a firework; it is a federally banned explosive.<br>
<br>
• M-250 and M-1000 (quarter-stick) - Large versions of the M-80 and M-100 that have extremely high risk factors for crippling and disfiguring injuries. This is not a firework; it is a federally banned explosive.<br>
<br>
• Torch - A 6-12" tube filled with colored material and ending in a handle. When ignited, streams of colors come out of the top of the tube.<br>
<br>
• Wheel-type Device - A firework that spins or twirls is a "wheel" and thus is neither a "cylindrical fountain" nor a "cone fountain."<br>
<br>
Legal firework, no permit required:<br>
<br>
• Flat paper caps - containing not more than .25 of a grain of explosive content per cap.<br>
<br>
• Toy noise makers - toy pistols, toy cannons, toy canes, toy trick noise makers, and toy guns in which paper caps are used.<br>
<br>
• Sparklers - containing no more than .0125 pounds of burning portion per sparkler.<br>
<br>
• Flitter sparklers - in paper tubes not exceeding 1/8 inch in diameter.<br>

<br>
• Never re-light a "dud" firework (wait 15 to 20 minutes and then soak it in a bucket of water).<br>
<br>
• Never give fireworks to small children.<br>
<br>
• If necessary, store fireworks in a cool, dry place.<br>
<br>
• Dispose of fireworks properly by soaking them in water and then disposing of them in your trashcan.<br>
<br>
• Never throw or point fireworks at other people.<br>
<br>
• Never carry fireworks in your pocket.<br>
<br>
• Never shoot fireworks in metal or glass containers.<br>
<br>

<br>
• Stay away from illegal explosives.<br>
<br>
• Use legal fireworks only.</td><tr>

The rushing waters from last week’s rain turned a normally peaceful river into a rushing tunnel of bucking, churning water.

<br>
Q: Where did the names Wexford and Cadillac originate?<br>
<br>
According to the Cadillac Chamber of Commerce, Wexford County was originally named Kautawabet in 1840 after Chief Broken Tooth, a Potawatami leader. In 1843, Michigan legislators renamed the county Wexford, after a southern county of Ireland.<br>
<br>
At it’s founding, Cadillac was originally called Clam Lake. During its incorporation into a city, it was renamed Cadillac after Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, an early Michigan explorer and founder of Detroit.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Energy efficient light bulbs contain mercury, so how or where is the proper place to dispose of them?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 06/07/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>"People are switching to CFLs because of the energy and monetary savings," said Earth911.com President Jonathan Smith. "However, responsible disposal of CFLs is critical."<br>
<br>
Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing, about the amount that would cover the tip of a ballpoint pen, according to Energy Star, a joint government program between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.<br>
<br>
Energy Star recommends that used or broken CFLs be disposed of in designated recycling centers. Isabella County Recycling Center in Mount Pleasant and the Emmet County Recycling Center in Harbor Springs are two centers that will accept CFLs from all Michigan residents.<br>
<br>
In the absence of a recycling center, Energy Star recommends that used or broken bulbs be sealed in two plastic bags and placed in the outside trash for the next normal trash collection.<br>
<br>
When cleaning up broken bulbs:<br>
<br>
1. Before Clean-up: air out the room<br>
<br>
• Have people and pets leave the room, and don’t let anyone walk through the breakage area on their way out.<br>
<br>
• Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more.<br>
<br>
• Shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system, if you have one.<br>
<br>
2. Clean-Up Steps for Hard Surfaces<br>
<br>
• Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.<br>
<br>
• Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass pieces and powder.<br>
<br>
• Wipe the area clean with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes. Place towels in the glass jar or plastic bag.<br>
<br>
• Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean up the broken bulb on hard surfaces.<br>
<br>
3. Clean-up steps for carpeting or rug<br>
<br>
• Carefully pick up glass fragments and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.<br>
<br>
• Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.<br>
<br>
• If vacuuming is needed after all visible materials are removed, vacuum the area where the bulb was broken.<br>
<br>
• Remove the vacuum bag (or empty and wipe the canister), and put the bag or vacuum debris in a sealed plastic bag.<br>
<br>
4. Clean-up Steps for clothing, bedding, etc.<br>
<br>
• If clothing or bedding materials come in direct contact with broken glass or mercury-containing powder from inside the bulb that may stick to the fabric, the clothing or bedding should be thrown away. Do not wash such clothing or bedding because mercury fragments in the clothing may contaminate the machine and/or pollute sewage.<br>
<br>
• You can, however, wash clothing or other materials that have been exposed to the mercury vapor from a broken CFL, such as the clothing you are wearing when you cleaned up the broken CFL, as long as that clothing has not come into direct contact with the materials from the broken bulb.<br>
<br>
• If shoes come into direct contact with broken glass or mercury-containing powder from the bulb, wipe them off with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes. Place the towels or wipes in a glass jar or plastic bag for disposal.<br>
<br>
5. Disposal of clean-up materials<br>
<br>
• Immediately place all clean-up materials outdoors in a trash container or protected area for the next normal trash pickup.<br>
<br>
• Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials.<br>
<br>
• Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific area. Some states do not allow such trash disposal. Instead, they require that broken and unbroken mercury-containing bulbs be taken to a local recycling center.<br>
<br>
6. Future cleaning of carpeting or rug: air out the room during and after vacuuming<br>
<br>
• The next several times you vacuum, shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system and open a window before vacuuming.<br>
<br>
• Keep the central heating/air conditioning system shut off and the window open for at least 15 minutes after vacuuming is completed.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Rover put this question to Cadillac’s John Bunnell, a former school teacher who has devoted hours of research to the life of Adolph "Ad" Wolgast, nicknamed the "Michigan Wildcat." Wolgast captured the world light-weight boxing crown in 1910.<br>
<br>
Bunnell said he has talked to the schools about putting Wolgast in the Hall of Fame as an honorary member but that request has been turned down twice. Bunnell would also like to see the Wexford Civic Arena renamed in honor of the boxer. Bunnell has created pictures displays in the Civic Arena about Wolgast’s history. However, although he never thought about the idea of a statue, Bunnell thinks it’s a great idea.<br>
<br>
"We are approaching 2010," he explained. "That will be the 100th anniversary of his winning the world title. So that gives us two years to get the statue ready. That would be a neat idea. But it would take some people to get behind this idea."<br>
<br>

Paulos has given Sue and Joe Conerly information about the history of the building, which was built in 1910. That makes those green bricks almost 100 years old. Glazed bricks were first used in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Many of these glazed bricks were manufactured by a process called salt glazing, a process taken from the pottery industry. Most likely the bricks on the front of Furniture by Design Antiques were salt glazed, a process no longer used because it emits toxic fumes.</td><tr>

In 2000, about 35 percent of the housing units in the city were rental units, meaning the city has only seen a 2 percent increase in eight years, which Adams explained was average for a mature urban community such as Cadillac.<br>

The percentage of rental units in Cadillac has been comparable to other communities. In 2000, Manistee had 35 percent rental units, Frankfort had 31 percent and Reed City and Traverse City were 41 percent rental units.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Tree trimming and removal is part of yearly maintenance done by Consumers Energy to clear power lines, according to Jon Hall, spokesperson for Consumers.

<br>
Hall explained that trees are involved in 30 percent of outages in the Consumers system. "Trimming and removal of trees is necessary to maintain safe and reliable electricity to our customers."<br>
<br>
Al Dumond, Parks, Forestry, and Cemetery Superintendent for the City of Cadillac explained that Consumers has the right of way near power lines. "If a tree is getting close to a primary electric line, they have their choice of either trimming or removal. Sometimes trimming works."<br>

To avoid the possibility of tree trimming or removal, Hall stressed the importance of planting the right tree in the right place. Tall growing trees will not be able to reach their full maturity if planted near a power line.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Like many private sector companies, several years ago the United States Postal Service made the decision to handle all customer inquiries through headquarters at 1-800-ASK-USPS, according to Sabrina Todd, Consumer Affairs for USPS. "This helps streamline the process of post offices so they can focus on their customers at the window. Clerks were being taken away from the window to answer the phones."<br>
<br>
A national 800 number also helps customers because trained representatives can provide and additional information on USPS services that a local post office may not have time to explain or offer. The switch was aimed at increasing the quality of customer assistance, both on the phone and inside the local post office.<br>
<br>
As to why Cadillac is the only local post office that lists the 800 number rather than a direct line, Todd explained that not all post office’s have made the switch, yet. Eventually, all phone book listing will provide the 800.</td><tr>

</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Lt. Dean Molnar, District Law Supervisor for District 4 of the DNR explained that placing a few branches to mark a shanty hole is actually a good safety measure. The holes that ice fishermen mark are shanty holes-holes that are at times 2 feet by 4 feet-left in the ice after removing shanties. The branches are indicators to people walking or driving a snowmobile or car that there is thin ice.<br>
<br>
"Quite a few fisherman will mark their shanty holes after they remove their shanty. It gives others a warning that there is a large opening in the ice," said Molnar. "The branches mark anything big enough for someone to fall into, not auger holes which are only 6 to 8 inch holes in the ice."<br>

Molnar advised that a few branches sticking up are not a problem, but leaving large amounts of woody debris would be discouraged.</td><tr>

Walters said that the best way to ensure the correct information is provided to phone book publishers is to contact your local phone service provider.

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>What was the reasoning for daylight savings time, schools and energy savings or something else, such as farming?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/22/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The concept of daylight savings time is largely attributed to Benjamin Franklin, due to a humorous essay he wrote in 1784 commenting on the common habit of going to bed at 3 a.m. and waking at noon-using seven hours of candles rather than free sunlight.<br>
<br>
According the Encyclopedia Britannica, the actual proposal of shifting the hours of the clock in the spring and fall was first proposed by Englishman William Willet in 1907. His justification was neither education, energy savings, or farming-but rather recreation. Shifting the hours to manipulate daylight would encourage people to use the morning hours of sunlight, and extend hours in the evening for activities such as golf. His proposal however, was rejected by the British House of Commons and not enacted into law. Willet’s proposal was finally passed into law in 1916.<br>
<br>
The first use of daylight savings time by the United States was during World War I, in order to conserve resources. The law passed in 1918 was repealed in 1919 due to its unpopularity. It was reinstated again during World War II from 1942 to 1945 to save energy and fuel.<br>
<br>
Since 1945, law has not mandated participation in Daylight Savings Time, but nearly all of the United States adheres to the practice.</td><tr>

The information I have seen so far hasn’t been very helpful. Is there a master list of digital compatible makes and models somewhere that can be accessed?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/15/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Glen Shack, Store Manager at ABC Warehouse explained that usually it is pretty simple to determine whether a TV is equipped with a digital receiver. Shack advised looking at the front of the tv near the logos. If the tv displays SDTV or HDTV, it means there is a digital receiver built in. The age of the TV does have some influence on the installation of the digital receiver, "but in some places you can still buy tv’s without the digital receiver," said Shack.<br>
<br>
The remote control can also be an indicator of a digital receiver. If on the bottom left of the keypad of the remote there is a "." or a "-" try entering 9.1 or 9-1. This is a digital station broadcast locally. If the TV displays a station, it has a digital receiver. If it doesn’t, the TV will need a digital tuner converter box.<br>
<br>
Another way to determine whether a TV has a digital receiver is to look through TV manual. In the "tuner set up" section of the manual, if it lists ATSC, the TV is equipped with a digital receiver.<br>
<br>
Alternate methods to discern whether a TV has a digital receiver would be to call the manufacturer or search the Internet. With a model number, it would possible to determine whether a digital receiver was installed during production.<br>
<br>
If a household currently receives television broadcast through an antenna rather than cable or satellite, a TV not equipped with a digital receiver will need a digital tuner converter box to receive TV broadcasts after Feb. 17, 2009. "What you need to do is call 1-888-DTV-2009 if you aren’t planning to purchase a TV with digital tuner. They will send you a two card coupons worth $40 each for invoicing a digital tuner converter box," said Shack.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Wal-Mart in Cadillac accepts used plastic shopping bags at drop off boxes in the front of the store, according to Melody Hurley, Personnel Manager. Customers may drop off the bags at any time, and are not limited to returning only Wal-Mart bags. Any empty bags free of receipts and other items may be returned. After being collected, all of the bags are shipped to the Wal-Mart distribution center where they are then sent to be recycled. "Wal-Mart always looks for way to improve and recycle as much as possible, and we encourage the community to be involved also," said Hurley.<br>
<br>
Save-A-Lot in Cadillac also accepts shopping bags to be re-used. Manager Glenn Bartholomew explained that "customers just come in and set them on the counter and we reuse them to bag another customer’s groceries." Noting how quickly bags can accumulate in homes, after being returned to the store, the store reuses them and they never have any leftover.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/08/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The student drop out rate for Cadillac High School for the 2005/2006 school year was 4.36 percent, as calculated by the state. With 245 students successfully graduating, this represents 11.17 students identified as "dropouts." CAPS Superintendent Paul Liabanow explained that the drop out rate calculated by the state represents all students unable to complete their graduation requirements within an allotted 4-year period. Some of the students included in the statistic may have completed the requirements for graduation and later received a diploma, but not within the 4 year period.<br>
<br>
Liabanow stated that there are many possible factors that may lead to a student dropping out including family challenges, getting behind due to illness, or getting behind on credit accumulation due to lack of attendance.<br>
<br>
"We are disheartened when a student drops out. We do everything we can to reinstate them in a program that will work for them. We know how important a diploma is for success for the rest of their lives."<br>
<br>
Cadillac High School offers several programs that may help struggling students continue their education and receive a diploma. These options include attending Cooley Alternative High School, participating in a drop out recovery program, or attending the Career Technical Center for half a day while spending the other half focusing on academic and core subjects to complete the credits required to receive a diploma. Students over 18 may also participate in CAPS adult education programs.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/01/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Wexford County Recycling Center, located at 5018 East M-115, is open 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wednesday and Friday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. Recyclable items, such as tin cans, cardboard, and plastics must be separated, according to Tim Fite, co-Manager of Wexford County Recycling Center.<br>
<br>
The recycling center accepts cardboards from paper bags to shoe boxes, paper products from newspapers to phone books and computer paper, clear and colored plastics, clear glass, tin cans and aluminum products such as foil and bakeware.<br>
<br>
Items that cannot be accepted include ice cream and frozen food containers, aerosol or paint cans, and plastic bags.<br>
<br>
"Recycling cuts down on the amount of trash going to the landfill. It cuts down on greenhouse gases and it takes less to reuse recycled materials," said Fite. "Nearly 300 to 400 people a week use the center."<br>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/23/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cherry Grove Township attracts a number of snowmobilers that travel roadways to reach the snowmobile trails. Currently, the township does not have a noise ordinance, according to Supervisor Ron Vaughan. "The township board has looked at it in the past, but has decided against it." The primary consideration for this decision is the issue of enforcement. The noise ordinance would come down to decibel levels, and without anyone to enforce it, and the difficultly of identifying individual offenders, establishing an ordinance would be meaningless.<br>
<br>
"We allow it because the law allows it," said Vaughan.<br>
<br>
In addition, several area businesses benefit from the snowmobilers, which indirectly benefit the township through the income generated from the people passing through.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/23/2008</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Dr. James Wilson, Medical Director for District Health Department No. 10 explained that white spots on fingernails may manifest for multiple reasons. Abnormalities with the whitish crescent under the nail, called the lunula, can be an indicative of certain systemic diseases. "The significance of these abnormalities is that certain diseases manifest in this part of the nail first." The white marks are an indication that nail bed is not growing properly, the first symptom of kidney, liver or heart disease.<br>
<br>
White marks on fingernails may also be the result of minor injury or trauma to the fingernail, such as pressure caused by hitting or slamming fingers in a door. With typical nail growth, the marks will take about 8 months to grow out, and are of little cause for concern.</td><tr>

Year round, volume of feed at any residence may not exceed two gallons, equal to the two-gallon limit on bait piles for hunting. The restrictions applied to feeding deer for recreational viewing and bait piles are similar due the primary reason for the limit in the first place - the increased potential for disease transmission.<br>

Recreational feeding regulations from the DNR also specify that the feed pile be within 100 yards from a residence and at lease 100 yards away from any area accessible to cattle, goats, and sheep.</td><tr>

Wouldn’t it be a lot safer for every one if the roads were cleared earlier before traffic started? After the last big storm I noticed that M-42 from Lake City to Manton was bare and wet" by 10 a.m. Why not" U.S. 131?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 08/09/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Alan Cooper, Wexford County Road Commission Manager, explained that the county has people out plowing during and after storms, but it’s usually not the full crew, because "we can’t put all of our guys out, because we don’t know when it will stop snowing."<br>
<br>
The county has 25 snowplow employees which the county allows to work a maximum of 16 consecutive hours.<br>
<br>
"We do have guys out early in the morning, but we just can’t cover every road - there’s no physical way we can do that by 7 a.m.," Cooper said. "If I have six to eight guys come in the morning, and it keeps snowing all day and night, I could run out of guys to send out later in the storm. We try to use our resources as best we can."<br>
<br>
Cooper said the Road Commission’s goal is to have all roads open, but their priority is opening highways and freeways. Next, the plows move to blacktop roads, and lastly, they clear gravel roads.<br>
<br>
The plows first clear highways and freeways, such as U.S. 131; however, sometimes the snow is coming so fast and heavy that once a plow finishes a road, they may have to re-plow the road. Once the plows clear the main road, they move to secondary roads.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, because of funds, the county is not hiring more snowplow employees, Cooper said.<br>
<br>
"Be patient with us," he said. "We are trying to do the best we can."</td><tr>

<br>
Students that compete are transported to designated locations throughout Michigan."

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 07/07/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Ken VanderMeeden, president of the Better Business Bureau of Western Michigan, a person can save a substantial amount of gas — and money — over time if they would just slow down a little.<br>
“For every 5 miles per hour you reduce highway speed, you can reduce fuel consumption by 7 percent,” he said. “If you typically drive 70 on the highway and slow down to 65, it’s the equivalent of saving 19 cents per gallon.”<br>
Other fuel saving tips, according to VanderMeeden, include;<br>
• Checking the air filter: a clean air filter can improve gas mileage by as much as 10 percent. Changing a dirty air filter can save the equivalent of 28 cents a gallon or carry or carry you 23 more miles on a tank of gas.<br>
• Align your car: fixing improper alignment would be like saving 10 percent or 28 cents per gallon.<br>
• Drive smoother: the smoother you accelerate and decelerate, the better your gas mileage, with potential gas savings of 33 percent on the highway and 5 percent around town. Consumers who currently drive erratically can pocket the equivalent of 48 cents a gallon by driving more smoothly.<br>
• Foot off: Riding with your foot on the brake not only wears out brakes but can also increase gas consumption by as much as 35 percent. By kicking the habit, you can get the equivalent of 96 cents per gallon in savings.</td><tr>

For high school students in grades nine through 12, the cost is $25 for the first sport, $10 for the second sport and no charge for the third sport.<br>
For sixth- through eighth-grade students, the cost is $10 for the first sport, $5 for the second and no charge for the third sport.<br>
“There is a $75 family max per season and a $150 family max per school year,” Horrigan said. “And you do not pay the fee until you make the team.”<br>
In the CAPS district, Horrigan said cuts have been made to athletics by more than 25 percent in the last three years. Rather than cut anymore programs, he said the fee was put into place.<br>
“One of things we decided to do in talking with the board, parents and boosters was to institute a small participate fee rather than cutting other programs,” Horrigan said. “It is very specific. You only pay if you make the team and it doesn’t guarantee more or less playing time for anyone.”<br>
For those students who would like to play a sport but it is a financial hardship to pay the participation fee, there are scholarships available. For those athletes that are injured or don’t finish the season (for reasons other than quitting), the school will work with the student on a refund.<br>
The pay-to-play program generates about $18,000 a year in participation fees. CAPS isn’t the only school in the area who has this program and Horrigan said he unfortunately doesn’t see it going away anytime soon.</td><tr>

He added that many of the old fields around the area are not around anymore including the fields at the fairgrounds and Diggins Hill. The field near Lincoln School also is scheduled to leave at some point, he added.<br>
Bruce said there are five new fields with two for baseball, two for softball and a T-ball field. At the time he said the bases were still being installed but he hopes the fields will be useable next week. The second bridge was constructed and more concession stands will be added.</td><tr>

“Because the ordinance changes a common practice that is detrimental to the parks, downtown  and the impacted waterfowl, the City of Cadillac<br>

Educational literature has been prepared for distribution and will be used in conjunction with signage to make people aware of the ordinance. However, repeat offenders may be cited.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 05/26/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Littering is addressed under Public Act 451 of 1994, which is the<br>
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act.<br>
Litter is defined in the act as “rubbish, refuse, waste material,<br>
garbage, offal, paper, glass, cans, bottles, trash, debris, or other<br>
foreign substances.”<br>
“The person responsible is guilty of a civil infraction when the amount<br>
of litter is less than one cubic foot in volume,” said City of Cadillac Public Safety Director Jeff Hawke. “Technically, a person throwing a cigarette butt out the window of a car is violating the littering statute. However, enforcing the statute at this level is often unrealistic as the violations are so numerous and difficult to detect.”<br>

One big difference in June, according to Summer, is there will be more video games. They will be adding more due to the market increasing from XBOX 360 and Nintendo sales.<br>
“By June, kids can walk in the game room and notice a big difference,” he said. “But movies will continue to be real strong. That is the bulk of our business.”</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>In the water purchase agreement between Ice Mountain and the city, Evart City Manager Roger Elkins said the city wouldn’t exceed the 25-year historical average from the well field.<br>
The maximum permitted capacity of water withdrawal from the city of Evart wells is 2.024 billion gallons year. Ice Mountain’s actual withdrawal of water was 62.3 million gallons in 2006 while Collin’s & Aikman withdrew 569.1 million gallons of water that same year.<br>
“When you do the math, it sounds large,” Elkins said. “But the amount of water Ice Mountain draws is a small fraction of the permitted capacity.”<br>
The water tower in Evart holds about 500,000 gallons of water while in Cadillac, Elkins said the water tower could hold even more water.<br>
To visualize how much 1.3 million gallons of water is, Deb Muchmore, spokesperson for Ice Mountain, said to picture a football field covered with roughly 10 feet of water (which is a few feet more than ceiling height).</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/14/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Because there are so many different areas of market value, it depends on the purpose of an appraisal said Diana Looney of Ace Appraisal Service of Lake City.<br>
For new construction, Looney said she uses the cost approach. For most requests — such as mortgages, estates and divorce — appraisals are based on the property sales and home sales in surrounding areas.<br>
“What we do is go out and measure the home, take pictures and take notes about the property,” she said. “Then we drive through the area to make sure the home conforms with the neighborhood.”<br>
After that, Looney said she has to do the figuring, which takes quite a bit of time.<br>
“It normally costs between $250 and $350 to appraise a home, and you are only at the home for an hour,” she said. “But most of the work is done afterward. There is a lot to it.”<br>
For new construction, Looney said the cost approach is used and with rental or commercial property, many times the income approach is used.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Although there will be a shift in the amount of taxes paid during the year, Cadillac City/Treasurer Clerk Jan Nelson said there will continue to be a summer and winter tax bill.<br>
The change, she said, is with the collection of the county operating taxes. In the past this was collected in the winter, but now it is being shifted to the summer.<br>
The shift was scheduled to be done in thirds, so it wouldn’t be such a large change at one time. The July 1, 2007 tax bill will be the first bill that will collect all county operating taxes on one bill.<br>
According to the Wexford County Treasurer’s Office, the change in county operating tax collection was in answer to a budget shortfall. All county governments are doing this because the state government cut out revenue sharing.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Any money used for repairing the fence comes out of the arena’s budget. And that money isn’t there, according to Wexford County Civic Arena Assistant Manager Ron Bennington.<br>
The fence was put up in 2000 as part of the U.S. 131 bypass beautification grant. <br>
“A group had gotten the grant to extend through here and it covered the fence and putting up some maple trees,” Bennington said. “There was a two-year contract where everything was kept up, but after that it became our responsibility for the upkeep.”<br>
Right now, Bennington said painting the fence is one of the lower priorities.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>A number of years ago, there was a senior citizens police academy done jointly by the Wexford County Sheriff’s Department and the Cadillac City Police.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>"This question comes up several times a year,” according to Alan Cooper, manager of the Wexford County Road Commission, “The traffic patterns at that intersection do not meet the requirements for a traffic signal and cost is a factor.” <br>
The cost of installing a timed traffic signal runs between $60,000 and $80,000.   <br>
Because the road commission and the city each are responsible for half of the intersection, both entities have been looking into a solution. One possible solution that the city and road commission engineers are looking at is a roundabout.<br>
There was one built in Gaylord last year that addressed a similar issue. This is something that is being looking at and there may be grants available for that type of project, but it isn’t something that will happen this year.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The work at Dairy Queen, which is on hold due to winter weather, is adding a new deck. As soon as the snow melts, construction will commence with pouring a new concrete deck and adding rod-iron fencing.<br>
“The wood deck will be gone and we will add new outdoor furniture,” said owner Sherry Davy. “But before that happens, we are waiting for Mother Nature to stop serving blizzards — that is our job.”<br>
Along with the new outdoor changes, customers will see changes to the menu, the interior and a new sign.<br>
“We are the only Michigan standalone Dairy Queen in a test where we are adding Orange Julius to the menu — with different flavors,” she said. “We also are adding waffle cones too.”<br>
The new sign will soon be put up, as soon is it arrives from its trek from Florida.<br>
Although the DQ opening is in May, the store has already opened to the public. The hours of operation are 11 a.m. to 10 a.m. seven days a week until Memorial Day, when it will be open later.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Although there are no plans for the entire city of Cadillac to go wireless due to costs, Cadillac Assistant City Manager Precia Garland said the city is looking at establishing a hot spot throughout the downtown area.<br>
“We have talked to three vendors and requested proposals to make the downtown a hot spot, but so far no on has come forward and presented us with a proposal,” Garland said. “Because no one has followed through, it is on the back burner at this point.”<br>

Garland said there are a number of businesses that do provide wireless Internet downtown including the Shay Station, The Bistro, Kodiaks and the Chefs Deli.<br>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/10/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The stamp in question is one of 40 Wonders of America stamps which is part of the U.S. Postal Service’s 2006 Commemorative Stamp Program. The stamps feature natural and man-made wonders of the United States.<br>
The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has the longest span (in the United States) at 4,260 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge follows with a span of 4,200 feet while the Mackinac Bridge comes in third with a span of 3,800 feet.<br>
Although the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has the longest span in the United States, it has the seventh longest span in the world.<br>
As for the Mackinac Bridge, which opened on Nov. 1, 1957, it was formally dedicated as “the world’s longest suspension bridge between anchorages,” according to the Mackinac Bridge Authority.<br>
This designation was chosen because it wouldn’t be the world’s largest using the customary way of measuring suspension bridges, as that title belonged to the Golden Gate Bridge. The Mackinac Bridge still is the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the western hemisphere, but is now the third longest worldwide.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>I noticed work is going to be done on the M-115 intersection at North Boulevard. As they do this, are they going to widen the area under the bridge so two boats can pass without having to alternate turns for boaters?
I know it doesn’t affect as many boaters as it will affect those cars using a safe turning lane, but if they are going to change the bridge anyway, why not make it better for everyone?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/03/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Del Kirkby of the Michigan Department of Transportation construction department, to wide the area under the bridge would mean tearing out the entire bridge – which is not in the plan.<br>
Construction will widen the bridge 11 1/2 feet beyond the existing dimensions.<br>
“To widen the channel would mean that we would have to remove all the existing bridge down to the foundation,” Kirkby said. “Then when we put a new bridge in to create more of a span, we would have to put bigger beams on the bridge. That would reduce head room underneath the bridge.”<br>
In addition to the extensive extra work, it would cost millions of dollars extra, which Kirkby said isn’t feasible.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The Wexford County Sheriff’s Department does have power to enforce handicapped parking, according to Undersheriff Marty Dahlstrom.<br>
“Handicapped parking is a state law, so we do enforce that,” he said. “But when it comes to stop signs in a private parking lot, that is a different deal. We don’t get involved in that.”<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>One in a while, on TV or in the newspaper, there is a story about crime that is committed. Many times they show a photo from a surveillance camera, asking people if they recognize the person on the tape.
Most of the time the photo is distorted, which makes it impossible to recognized a person. What is the sense of spending all that money on a surveillance camera if you can’t see the person anyway?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/24/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The reason many of the surveillance photos are low quality, according to Wexford County Sheriff’s Department Det./Lt. Dan O’Riley, is the digital computer image is taken from the film and then faxed — which distorts it.<br>
“When moving an image from a video camera to a still, you always get distortion,” O’Riley said. “We just hope that someone recognizes the person or clothing on the photo. They aren’t meant to be used as positive IDs, it is a source for leads.”<br>
In a photo released to media, O’Riley said it is a way for people to see height and build of a person or another type of feature.<br>
“It is amazing how someone sees a surveillance photo that is distorted,” he said. “For someone who knows the person in the photo, they sometimes can tell who it is by a hat they wear all the time or they can just tell who it is. It might not work 100 percent of the time or even 50 percent of the time, but if it works 30 percent of the time, it is worth it.”<br>
 The cost is usually minimal, it is just the price of running the equipment. Most of the time the surveillance equipment is paid for by the business, and many times it is cheaper to get a lower quality camera.<br>
Cameras purchased by cities usually have good quality equipment. Cameras in McBain helped police identify suspects and make an arrest recently when they broke into the McBain Pharmacy.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to the city ordinance on speed limits in school zones, the established speed limit for streets adjacent to school buildings is 25 miles per hour.<br>
“This would apply to the side streets in the subdivision east of the school that border the St. Ann Elementary playground,” said Cadillac Public Safety Director Jeff Hawke.<br>
Because 13th Street is bordered by St. Ann Church (not the school) and there are no sidewalks in the area parallel with this portion of the area, the school speed limit ordinance doesn’t apply.<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>If you eat a pound of chocolate, will you gain a pound of body weight?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/03/2007</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The following is an answer to the question from Cadillac Mercy Hospital Registered Nurse Julie Miller.<br>
To gain one pound of body fat, an average adult would need to eat 3,500 extra calories. In other words, one pound of body fat equals 3,500 calories.<br>
The average adult needs 12 to15 calories per pound of body weight to maintain their weight depending on activity level. For example, a man who weighs 225 pounds would need about 2,700 to 3,375 calories a day to maintain his weight depending on activity level. A woman who weighed 175 pounds would need 2,100 to 2,600 calories a day depending on her activity level.<br>
A pound and a quarter of chocolate equals 3,500 calories which equals one pound of stored fat. A pound and a half of chocolate equals 3,450 calories which equals one pound of stored fat. <br>
Theoretically, if a person ate 1.25 to 1.50 pound of chocolate above their daily calorie needs (see first paragraph for estimated daily calorie needs) to maintain their weight, they could gain one pound.<br>
Of interest is the fact that the body doesn’t really care where the excess calories come from (fruit, bread, meat, cheese, candy, cookies, pop), if they are above what the daily maintenance calorie needs are, it will turn to fat. <br>
So, in answer to your question: 1.25 to 1.50 pound of chocolate can lead to a pound of body fat if eaten in excess of what a person’s maintenance calorie needs are.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Under the Michigan Item Pricing Act, provided by the Michigan Attorney General, the state law requires most items on store shelves be clearly marketed with a price tag.<br>
When a person is charged for more than the price marked on the item, the shopper is entitled to request the difference between the market price and what was charged plus an additional compensation of 10 times the difference. The bonus must be at least $1, but may not be more than $5.<br>
The law also states that if the seller refuses to pay the difference (or bonus), a person may sue for actual damages plus attorney fees.<br>
If a price is not marked on a sale item and it scans for more than the sale price, a person is entitled to the sale price but not the bonus. <br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Under the Michigan Item Pricing Act, Meijer (like other stores) is required to price its products at the same price as it is entered into the Point of Sale System. According to Stacie Behler, vice president of corporate communications at Meijer in Grand Rapids, this is done so when a person checks out, the items are scanned at the same price as any tag that is required to be on the item.<br>
“If there is an error, the transaction has been completed, and you have a receipt indicating the item purchased and the price charged for it, you should take the item and the receipt to the Meijer service counter for assistance within 30 days,” Behler said. “At that point, with that information demonstrated to the service team members, you can ask for a refund of the difference between the amount charged and the price marked plus a "bonus" of ten times the difference, with a minimum of $1 and a maximum of $5.”<br>
Behler did note that not all items are required to be marked under the law. Those include unpackaged food items, those sold by weight, prepared food and items that have a total weight of 3 ounces or less.<br>
“Meijer works very hard to insure pricing integrity and stands compliant with the state law,” she added.<br>

“A significant aspect of this project is to consider alternative sites for additional wells,” Stalker said. “The new groundwater plume of contamination recently discovered in the area of the wellfield is not related to any known sources of contamination since it consists of a chemical called MTBE which was added to gasoline when lead was removed by the EPA many years ago.”<br>
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality continues to investigate the new plume, which further indicates the need for the Wellhead Protection Program to be implemented.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/30/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Glenna Anderson, administrative assistant at Lincoln School, the garden was started with help by Wild Ones, a local wildflower group.

"We just received a $400 grant through Wild Ones to maintain the garden," said Anderson. "Each classroom will adopt a section of the garden and will be responsible for maintaining it under the guidance of teachers and Wild Ones."<br>
Anderson added that because it will be a wildflower garden, so it won't look like traditionally groomed gardens. It will have a natural look because they want it to be like a native wildflower garden.<br>
"People should watch for things to start shaping up, because the upkeep will be ongoing for the science curriculum," said Anderson. "We are also going to try and tie it to the nearby walkway."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Does the $3.89 franchise fee on the Charter Cable bill go to the city of Cadillac? What is it used for?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/30/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Tim Ransberger of Charter Communications, Cadillac charges a 5 percent franchise fee which gets passed on to the customer's bills.<br>
"Franchise fees are established by the contract between a cable operator and the municipality," he said. "The contract is called a franchise agreement, and the maximum amount (set by the federal Cable Act) is 5 percent of a cable operator's revenues from providing cable service in the community."<br>
Franchise fees are derived as a percentage of a customer's bill and are not fixed rates — therefore the amount of the fee is determined by the level of service that a customer subscribes to. Ransberger added that it is generally considered that franchise fees are meant as compensation or "rent" for the use of the public rights-of-way, which is where the cable system is physically located.<br>
"I should note that cable modem service (high speed Internet service) is not subject to franchise fees because the FCC has deemed the high speed Internet service is not a cable service, but an information service," said Ransberger. "Therefore, it is not subject to franchise fees."<br>
He added that he doesn't know what the city does with the revenue collected by the revenue fee, but many times it goes into a general fund.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/30/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Michelle Smith, manager of the Wexford County Animal Shelter, cats and dogs are under the same city ordinance and are supposed to be put on a leash if they aren't on their own property.<br>
"The city ordinance says that no animal should be left at large," she said. "If someone wants to take their cat outside, it should be on a leash and not left running around on its own."<br>
Animal control will pick up a cat, but only if it is contained. The cat must be in some kind of cage or box, or held.<br>
"We won't chase a cat around town," said Smith. "We won't chase a cat up a tree either, for that matter. If someone calls to report a cat at large, they must have it contained."</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>What is the liability issue on dogs defecating on city sidewalks or on personal property such as yards? What can be done?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 04/16/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Kris Corwin, Wexford County Animal Shelter attendant, there is a city ordinance requiring dog owners to pick up waste from their pet.<br>
"If a dog defecates on a sidewalk, yard, school playground or anywhere, it is the owner's responsibility to clean it up," she said. "It is, at the very least, a littering problem as well as a health issue. The owner must pick up after the animal, as well as have it on a leash when taking a walk."<br>
Although it is hard to enforce the ordinance because you have to witness the act, the dog owner could be fined for not picking up after the dog. Corwin said if someone sees a dog go to the bathroom and the owner doesn't clean up after it, they can report it if they know who the owner is.<br>
"People can report the incident, but it may not be taken care of right away because of other more important matters," said Corwin. "Someone will respond to all complaints at some time however."<br>
Corwin also reminds people to keep their dogs on a leash and pick up after the animal, as the ordinances say. It is a good idea to bring a bag along just in case. She also said not to let their dogs roam because people are supposed to call the shelter if they spot a stray animal.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>According to Rick Liptak of the Michigan Department of Transportation, if there is not a sign, it is a statutory 55 miles per hour.<br>
“If there is a sign, that would mean it (the speed limit) is reduced,” said Liptak. “But I believe that it is a statutory 55 right now.”<br>
MDOT established the speed limit in that area based on the speed of what 85 percent of drivers are driving.<br>
"We may have had a speed study and it showed that at least 85 percent of the drivers were driving at least 55 mph, so it didn't warrant to reduce it," he said.<br>
Liptak added that the area will probably be evaluated and the speed adjusted after the signal is activated near the new Wal-Mart Supercenter.</td><tr>

Depending on how many prescription drugs they accumulate, the pharmacy calls the doctors once or twice a month. They also accept other devices that are in need in those countries such as blood glucose machines or eyeglasses.<br>
"It sure beats flushing them (prescription drugs) down the toilet," said Moffit. "Those countries have less restrictions on medications, so they aren't scrutinized as much."<br>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cadillac Department of Public Works Director Bob Johnson said the ice skating rink is a community school issue but Diggins Hill is not an approved ski area. It is a sled at your own risk hill and is not a developed area. Using the hill is no different than going out on a hill anywhere else and going sledding. That being said, Johnson said there has been some public interest in improving the hill for sledding and snowboarding. A group has talked about having a fundraiser. Right now with the funding being an issue across the board, Johnson said there are no plans to upgrade the hill from the city’s end. As far as the outside ice rink, Community Schools Director John Horrigan said it is not a viable commodity. Horrigan said it was very difficult to get a rink flooded before Christmas and generally in February it would begin melting under the warmer sun. The cost involved to have someone work it and for upkeep also were issues when running an outdoor ice rink especially with the ice surface at the Wexford County Civic Arena, Horrigan said.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/12/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>It is the Cadillac Viking Hall of Fame and is for former graduates, coaches or honorary inductees, according to Cadillac Athletic Director John Horrigan. Criteria for entrance to the hall includes being a graduate of Cadillac High School, coached at the high school or had to work/volunteer to help improve the high school or athletic program, Horrigan said. While Horrigan said he knows Wolgast has contributed to the YMCA and did a lot for youth in the community, the hall is the Cadillac Viking Hall of Fame. While he also believes, Wolgast should be honor he does not feel the Cadillac Viking Hall of Fame is the right venue and is something the community should do similar to the Keith McKellop Walkway.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why are there no ribbons or signs of warming where the ice is unsafe to warn drivers to stay off the ice?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 03/12/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Cadillac Department of Public Works Director Bob Johnson said there are a couple of reasons why ribbons or signs are not on the lakes warning people of unsafe ice. First, the city does not have control of the lakes. For example, if the city put a sign on the lake that said it was safe to drive on and someone fell through, it would be a liability, Johnson said. It also is not the city’s area of responsibility. People are responsible for their actions, he said. There are no guarantees. Second, he said no lake is safe to drive on. A lot of people drive on the lake but the bottom line is no lake is safe to drive on.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/26/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>Because there are very few records on that, CAPS Director of Transportation said he believed it started with the 1983-1984 school year. It began with pickups at all the elementaries in town as well as one other stop in town. Students had to live at least 1 1/2 miles from the high school to get a ride, according to Pals Being a former student of CAPS, Pals said prior to the 83-84 school year there was no busing within the city. Students had to walk or get a ride. Currently, there are still walking routes which includes some elementary students, Pals said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>How is it that Wal-Mart can put a gas station in right across the street from where Peterson’s proposed gas station got so much resistance?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/26/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The simple answer is there wasn’t much opposition, according to Haring Township Zoning Administrator Gary Fuller. Fuller said the Wal-Mart station was part of a site plan review, there was a public hearing for it and there wasn’t much opposition to it. Likewise, Haring Township Planning Board Chair Stan Fawcett said when the Peterson’s proposed station was turned down, there was no commercial development in that area. The new Wal-Mart store going up further enforces the commercial zoning of the area, Fawcett said. There were continual rumors the proposed Peterson’s development was going to be a truck stop and those unfounded rumors led to anxiety in residents near by, Fawcett said.</td><tr>

<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/26/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The city did have Santa and Christmas in the Park events, according to Downtown Cadillac Association President Pat Goggin. Santa lit the lights around the lake and then led a procession to the Sweet Shop the weekend before Thanksgiving. The idea in 2004 was to bring Santa closer to the downtown and into the stores, to give merchants the opportunity to host Santa for an afternoon. The Santa House was always cold, cramped and people had to stand outside, Goggin said. The idea was to try and improve those things and help connect the merchants, Goggin said.</td><tr>

<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Question:</td><td class='body'>Why aren’t real estate signs subject to the same laws about being in the right-of-way?</td><tr>
<tr><td></td><td class='body_italic'>Date Published: 02/26/2005</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' valign='top' class='titles2'>Answer:</td><td class='body'>The signs are not supposed to be on the sidewalk and street and they are suppose to be on the person’s property, according to Real Estate Agent Willa Fagerman. The signs are suppose to be right in front of the house and not between sidewalks and street but there are not any specific rules as far as number of feet, Fagerman said. Similarly, Cadillac MDOT Service Center Manager Rick Liptak said it depends on whether the signs are on premise or off premise. If the property is along a state highway, property owners may have real estate signs in front of their business or homes. It is consider on premise, Liptak said. If the home or business is on a county road, a sign can not be along a state highway pointing up the county road toward the business or house. It is consider off premise, Liptak said.</td><tr>
