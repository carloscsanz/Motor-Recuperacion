sometime between 1970 and 1975. However, the VSM as it is understood

"A Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval" (alleged to

represent a confusion of two 1975 articles, neither of which were
overviews of the VSM as a model of information retrieval. Until the late

Information Science (<a onmouseover="t_i(8)" onmouseout="t_o(8)" class=tip href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/JASIS">JASIS</a><span ID=Tp8 class=hint> JASIS Journal of the American Society for Information Science </span>) (Crouch et al., 1996), Carolyn Crouch
declares that Gerard Salton was more than just the leading authority in
the field of information retrieval (IR). For thirty years, Crouch
writes, "Gerry Salton was information retrieval" (p. 108)
During times when the significance of computational IR research was in
doubt, Salton defended and supported it "through the sheer force of
his own personality and reputation" (Crouch et al., 1996, p. 108).
Crouch's sentiments are echoed in the memoriam by Salton's
other colleagues and former proteges, who reflect on his many
contributions in research, teaching, writing, editing, and service to
scholarly societies. They cite the textbooks he wrote, the SMART system
developed under his leadership, the scholars that he mentored, and many
other contributions. Donna Harman reminds the reader that Salton
investigated "the use of the vector space model in clustering,
<a onmouseover="t_i(9)" onmouseout="t_o(9)" class=tip rel=nofollow href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Relevance+feedback">relevance feedback</a><span ID=Tp9 class=hint> <b>Relevance feedback</b> is a feature of some information retrieval systems. The idea behind relevance feedback is to take the results that are initially returned from a given query and to use information about whether or not those results are relevant to perform a new query. </span>, automatic linking, book indexing, passage retrieval,
visualization, and many other areas" (Crouch et al., 1996, p. 108).<BR><BR>It is hardly surprising that Dr. Harman would cite Salton's
pioneering research in the vector space model (VSM) for information
retrieval: there are numerous citations crediting Salton with the
original development of that IR model, as well as responses commenting
on its advantages and limitations and proposing extensions or
alternatives to it (Bollmann-Sdorra &amp; Raghavan, 1993, 1998; Raghavan
&amp; Wong, 1986; Wong &amp; Raghavan, 1984; Wong, Ziarko, &amp; Wong,
1985; Wong, Ziarko, Raghavan, &amp; Wong, 1986, 1987; McGill &amp;
Huitfeldt, 1979; Singhal, 2001; Howland &amp; Park, 2004; Kobayashi
&amp; Aono, 2004). What is surprising, however, is that there is
evidence that the VSM evolved over a much longer period of time than is
usually acknowledged and that Salton did not publish an articulation of
the model and its assumptions until several years after criticisms of
those assumptions had been leveled and alternative models proposed (see
section 7 below).<BR><BR>In giving credit to Salton for the vector model, a number of
authors cite an overview paper titled "A Vector Space Model for
Information Retrieval," which some show as published in the JASIS
in 1975 and others as published in the Communications of the <a onmouseover="t_i(10)" onmouseout="t_o(10)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Association+for+Computing+Machinery">Association
for Computing Machinery</a><span ID=Tp10 class=hint> See ACM. <hr><br><b>Association for Computing Machinery</b> - Association for Computing </span>&nbsp;(<a onmouseover="t_i(11)" onmouseout="t_o(11)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/CACM">CACM</a><span ID=Tp11 class=hint> <b>CACM</b> - Communications of the ACM </span>) in 1975. In fact, no such article was
ever published, and citations to it usually represent a confusion of two
1975 articles (Salton, Wong, &amp; Yang, 1975; Salton, Yang, &amp; Yu,
1975), neither of which were overviews of the VSM as it is generally
understood (see section 5 below). Some of Salton's own colleagues
have been guilty of this mistake: both Cardie et al. and Singhal cite
the CACM version, for example (Singhal, 2001; Cardie, Ng, Pierce, &amp;
Buckley, 2000). The paper is even cited in a few of the very last
articles on which Salton is listed as a coauthor (Singhal, Salton,
Mitra, &amp; Buckley, 1996; Singhal &amp; Salton, 1995). These papers
were published close to or shortly after the time of his death, and so
the errors cannot be blamed on Salton (remembered by his colleagues as a
very careful and meticulous writer).<BR><BR>Another irony--one representing a more fitting tribute to
Salton's legacy--is that locating papers containing the mistaken
citation is very difficult using conventional citation databases such as
the Web of Science. But discovery of the errors is greatly aided by
search engines such as Google and CiteSeer--systems that employ
techniques similar to those that Salton himself refined and recommended.
The following papers were found in this way, and they cite one or the
other versions of the bibliographic ghost: McCabe, Lee, Chowdhury,
Grossman, &amp; Frieder, 2000; Theophylactou &amp; Lalmas, 1998;
Arampatzis, van der Weide, Koster, <a onmouseover="t_i(12)" onmouseout="t_o(12)" class=tip rel=nofollow href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Van+Bommel">van Bommel</a><span ID=Tp12 class=hint> <b>van Bommel</b> is a surname of Dutch origin, and may refer to: <ul><li>Mark van Bommel (born 1977), Dutch football player <li>Harry van Bommel (born 1962), Dutch politician </ul><br><em>This page or section lists people with the surname <b>Van Bommel</b>.</EM> </span>, 2000; Chen, 2001; Jiang
&amp; Littman, 2001; Nallapati, 2003. This leads us to the following
questions: How did this mistake occur, and how was it perpetuated to the
degree that it was? The answer seems to lie in a misconception widely
held even by people who cite Salton's publications correctly: it is
assumed that a description of the VSM must have been published sometime
around 1975, even though it was not characterized as an IR model at that
time.<BR><BR>VECTOR SPACES AND <a onmouseover="t_i(13)" onmouseout="t_o(13)" class=tip rel=nofollow href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Mathematical+model">MATHEMATICAL MODELS</a><span ID=Tp13 class=hint> <dl><dd><em>Note: The term </em>model<em> has a different meaning in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. An artifact which is used to illustrate a mathematical idea is also called a </em>mathematical model<em> and this usage is the reverse of the sense explained below.</EM></DL></DD> </span><BR><BR>We begin with a description of the VSM that Salton included in
chapter 10 of his 1989 book on automatic text processing. That treatment
includes the following characterization:<BR><BR>1.

computed between queries and documents.<BR><BR>3. Queries and documents are represented by term sets.<BR><BR>4. Both queries and documents can then be represented as ordered
term vectors.<BR><BR>5. The components of the vectors are numbers representing either
the importance of a term or simply the presence or absence of a term (1
or 0, respectively).<BR><BR>As mentioned above, the origins of these features are considerably
earlier than the publications usually credited with the definition of
the VSM. Salton himself did not publish a full articulation of the VSM
as a retrieval model until this chapter, however, which appeared years
after he was publicly credited with having invented the VSM.<BR><BR>The VSM is a mathematical model. Generalizing a definition by

physical, biological, social, psychological, or conceptual entity. They
cite a number of uses for mathematical models, including:<BR><BR>1. predicting events in the physical world<BR><BR>2. guiding observation or experimentation<BR><BR>3. fostering conceptual understanding<BR><BR>4. assisting the "axiomatization of the physical
situation" (Davis &amp; Hersh, 1981, p. 78)<BR><BR>5. promoting progress in mathematics<BR><BR>So there are any number of ways in which the VSM might represent an
advance for or contribution to IR research or systems design. Clarifying
the particular role it plays as a model recommends a closer look at how
vector representations are used to model other domains. The vector space
is a very general and flexible abstraction, used to model many different
domains and applications. When one makes the claim that a system or
phenomenon is or can be modeled by a vector space, the first question
one must consider is the <a onmouseover="t_i(18)" onmouseout="t_o(18)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/level+of+abstraction">level of abstraction</a><span ID=Tp18 class=hint> The level of complexity by which a system is viewed. The higher the level, the less detail. The lower the level, the more detail. The highest level of abstraction is the single system itself. </span>&nbsp;at which that claim is
being made:
<pre>
   Algebraic--At the most abstract level, it can be a claim about
   addition and multiplication operations defined on a nonempty
   set of objects. Specifically, the claim that these operations
   satisfy all the algebraic axioms for a vector space (for
   example, addition commutes, multiplication distributes over
   addition, etc.). An example of a claim at this level is that
   the set of polynomials of degree no greater than n define a
   vector space (Lay, 1994).

   Measurement-theoretic--At another level, to say that something
   is represented by a vector space can be an empirical claim that
   two or more variables define a space. In that case, the substance
   of the claim is about ordinal and additive relations holding
   among the values of those variables for some known entities
   (that is, that the variables are quantitative) and also that
   distance between the entities is a function of the differences
   along each of the individual variables defining the space
   (Michell, 1990).

   Physical--Real vector spaces are often used to model physical
   forces such as gravity and relations such as velocity. For
   example, the direction and velocity of a boat may be represented
   by a vector, the speed and direction of the current is
   represented by a second vector, and the course and speed made
   good are shown to be the sum of those vectors (Fraleigh &amp;
   Beauregard, 1987). Models such as these entail claims about the
   physical world.

   Data-centric--In multivariate analysis, vector spaces are used
   to model a set of observations. The data is typically represented
   as a matrix where items or cases are represented as rows and
   observations for a particular feature are represented as columns.
   Geometrically, the cases are understood to be plotted in the space
   of feature values, but no empirical claim about the features,
   the nature, or relations among the values need be advanced: in
   this case, the vector space is simply a way of presenting the
   values assigned to the observations. This representation typically
   precedes a transformation of the data, such as reexpressing them
   in a space of lower dimensionality in order to reveal latent
   structures or patterns (Green &amp; Carroll, 1976). In that case, the
   operations performed using the data can be explained and
   understood as operations on vectors and matrices.
</Pre><BR><BR>It is at this last data-centric level that one should understand
the use of vector abstractions in most of Salton's IR publications:
vector components represent raw or modified observations, and relations
between vectors (such as the cosine of the angle between pairs of them)
are devices for explaining computations or other design choices about
how an IR system operates. As we shall see, the habit of describing data
and computations in terms of operations on vectors eventually became so
familiar that some later interpretations seem to lose sight of the role
the vector model was intended to play.<BR><BR>EARLIEST EXAMPLES<BR><BR>The elements of what would come to be known as the VSM are evident
in Sahon's earliest publications on experimental IR and also the
work of other authors (Switzer, 1965; Sammon, 1968). In a 1963 article
in the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a onmouseover="t_i(19)" onmouseout="t_o(19)" class=tip href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/JACM">JACM</a><span ID=Tp19 class=hint> JACM Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery<br>JACM Just Another Code Monkey </span>), Salton
describes systems and methods for what at that time he calls
"<a onmouseover="t_i(20)" onmouseout="t_o(20)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/associative">associative</a><span ID=Tp20 class=hint> <span class="hw">as·so·ci·a·tive</span>&nbsp; <br><i>adj.</i><br><b>1. </b> Of, characterized by, resulting from, or causing association.<br><br><b>2. </b> <i>Mathematics</i> Independent of the grouping of elements. </span>&nbsp;<a onmouseover="t_i(21)" onmouseout="t_o(21)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/document+retrieval">document retrieval</a><span ID=Tp21 class=hint> The ability to search for documents by keywords and other attributes such as date and author.

earlier work by people such as H. P. Luhn, Salton outlines the
architecture for automated systems that extract words from

significant enough to represent the document content, and compute
measures of association between pairs of terms, pairs of documents, and
between documents and queries.<BR><BR>Even in this early paper one finds frequencies of extracted words
presented using matrix and <a onmouseover="t_i(23)" onmouseout="t_o(23)" class=tip rel=nofollow href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Vector+notation">vector notation</a><span ID=Tp23 class=hint> For information on vectors as a mathematical object see vector (spatial). This page is about notation of vectors. <b>Declaration</b><br>A vector can be declared in three ways: <ul><li>Parentheses can enclose an ordered set of coordinates:</UL> </span>&nbsp;and the cosine of angles
between vectors recommended as a measure of association. The vector
representation is employed to describe similarities computed using both
extracted words and citation data. Furthermore, it is clear that vector
representations are to be understood precisely at the data-centric level
described above: the term-document matrix is called an incidence matrix,
leaving no doubt that what the vector components model are observations.
The similarity measures are at all points described as methods or
operations on the data that can be interpreted as relations between
vectors.<BR><BR>SMART was the system Salton developed over the course of his career
as an IR researcher. More than just an IR system, SMART was the working
expression of Sahon's theories and the experimental environment in
which those theories were evaluated and tested (Salton, 1971). The
earliest papers describing the SMART system show that the same
extraction and association procedures outlined in the JACM article are
central to SMART's design and operation (Salton, 1965b; Salton
&amp; Lesk, 1965). In 1965 Salton published a paper in <a onmouseover="t_i(24)" onmouseout="t_o(24)" class=tip rel=nofollow href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/IEEE+Spectrum">IEEE Spectrum</a><span ID=Tp24 class=hint> <b><i>IEEE Spectrum</i></b> is a magazine edited by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The IEEE's description of it is:<br><br><dl><dd><em>IEEE Spectrum Magazine, the flagship publication of the IEEE, explores the development, applications and implications of new</EM></DL></DD> </span>&nbsp;titled "Progress in Automatic Information Retrieval" (1965a).
That article discusses specific features of SMART and characterizes
document representations and similarity computations in terms of
vectors. In addition, relevance feedback experiments (conducted by J. J.
Rocchio) are described in terms of query vector modifications. In all
these examples, the vector spaces illustrate how computations such as
similarity measures and relevance feedback are applied to the data; the
vector spaces are models of computations executed by the system.<BR><BR>RETRIEVAL MODELS<BR><BR>In 1968 Salton published Automatic Information Organization and
Retrieval, a book that presents a more developed treatment of the
concepts introduced in the earlier IR papers and more details on the
design and evaluation of the SMART system. Salton devotes chapter 6
entirely to retrieval models but, interestingly, that chapter contains
none of the vector or matrix notation seen in the earlier papers. This
is not to say that vector representations are absent from the book: as
in the earlier writings, they appear in the context of explaining
specific computations in the chapters on statistical operations (4) and
the retrieval process (7). But for Salton a retrieval model was closer
to the formal model later presented by Bookstein and Cooper (Bookstein
&amp; Cooper, 1976). (1) Retrieval models, <a onmouseover="t_i(25)" onmouseout="t_o(25)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/according+to">according to</a><span ID=Tp25 class=hint> <span class="hw">according to</span><br><i>prep.</i><br><b>1. </b> As stated or indicated by; on the authority of: <span class="illustration">according to historians.</span><br><br><b>2. </b> In keeping with: <span class="illustration">according to instructions.</span><br><br><b>3.</B> </span>&nbsp;this
understanding, are more abstract than particular computations. The
retrieval operation is understood as a mapping between the space of
query words and the space of documents (that is, replacement of the
former by the latter). Salton presents retrieval models in set-theoretic
terms, though there is no reason why vectors could not be used to model
retrieval at the same level of abstraction: John W. Sammon Jr. published
an abstract model similar to Salton's using vectors rather than
sets (Sammon, 1968). According to Salton, a retrieval model should
explicate such issues as<BR><BR>* whether a particular set has a well-defined complement<BR><BR>* whether the request space is identical with the object space;
that is, whether the set of possible query descriptions is the same as
the set of possible document descriptions<BR><BR>* whether document and query identifiers are unstructured and
independent of one another or whether relations between them are defined<BR><BR>* implications of order relations on queries and documents, such as
whether a more specific query guarantees the retrieval of fewer
documents and whether those will be a proper subset of a more general
query<BR><BR>* whether the system contains a classification language (that is, a
set of categories distinct from the document description language) and
functions to map document and request descriptions into those categories<BR><BR>* whether elements of the description languages are all positive
properties, or whether <a onmouseover="t_i(26)" onmouseout="t_o(26)" class=tip href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Negation">negation</a><span ID=Tp26 class=hint> NEGATION. Denial.

other existing property<BR><BR>A retrieval model, according to Salton, represents documents,
description features (such as index terms), queries, and the
relationships within and across those sets. The vector spaces described
in the 1968 book, however, are not models of documents, terms, or
queries: they are models of <a onmouseover="t_i(27)" onmouseout="t_o(27)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/numeric+data">numeric data</a><span ID=Tp27 class=hint> Refers to quantities and money amounts used in calculations. Contrast with string or character data. </span>&nbsp;and of computations with those
data. The numbers represent the documents, terms, and queries within a
system such as SMART. The vector space models are explanatory devices
intended to help the reader understand how part of a system works; the
retrieval model speaks to more general questions, such as those listed
above.<BR><BR>Some of the retrieval modeling issues have since recurred in
disputes that intimately couple them with those of vector
representations (as explained below). But in 1968 Salton treated these
modeling issues separately from those used to characterize similarity
and relevance feedback computations.<BR><BR>THE TERM DISCRIMINATION MODEL<BR><BR>In 1974 and 1975 Salton published several important papers on a
theory of indexing and a method for selecting words from documents and
assigning <a onmouseover="t_i(28)" onmouseout="t_o(28)" class=tip href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/numeric">numeric</a><span ID=Tp28 class=hint> numeric<br><br>see numerical.<br><hr align="left" class="hmshort"/><br><b>numeric cluster</b><br>see ten-key pad. </span>&nbsp;weights to them. The presentation of this model,
called the "term discrimination value model" (<a onmouseover="t_i(29)" onmouseout="t_o(29)" class=tip href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/TDV">TDV</a><span ID=Tp29 class=hint> TDV Tony De Vit<br>TDV TDVision <span class=illustration>(high definition stereo 3D acquisition, broadcast and playback)</span><br>TDV Total Document Volume <span class=illustration>(office automation)</span><br>TDV Truth, Duty, Valour <span class=illustration></SPAN> </span>), would
prove to be significant not only because an automatic indexing principle
was expressed in this model but also because of its impact on the IR
research community's perception of what became known as the VSM.<BR><BR>The term discrimination model proposes that document features (such
as extracted words) most useful for indexing will be those that increase
the average dissimilarity between pairs of documents. In the basic
conception the computed similarity averaged over every document pair is
compared with and without the inclusion of a feature under
consideration. The features are then ranked by the difference between
those averages, with the best having the most dramatic lowering of
average similarity when they are included. The process of computing a
discrimination value can be speeded by comparing each document to an
artificial average or <a onmouseover="t_i(30)" onmouseout="t_o(30)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Centroid">centroid</a><span ID=Tp30 class=hint> <b>centroid</b><br><br>In geometry, the centre of mass of a two-dimensional figure or three-dimensional solid. Thus the centroid of a two-dimensional figure represents the point at which it could be balanced if it were cut out of, for example, sheet metal. </span>&nbsp;document rather than computing
similarities for every document pair.<BR><BR>It is not essential to the TDV indexing model that similarity
computations be explained in terms of operations on vectors or that
document features be weighted or ordered. But, not surprisingly, Salton
explained the model geometrically using vectors as he had done in the
earlier publications. The key publications on the TDV indexing model are
a Cornell technical report (Salton, 1974) that was republished a year
later as a <a onmouseover="t_i(31)" onmouseout="t_o(31)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/monograph">monograph</a><span ID=Tp31 class=hint> <span class="hw">mon·o·graph</span>&nbsp; <br><i>n.</i><br>A scholarly piece of writing of essay or book length on a specific, often limited subject.<br><br><i>tr.v.</i> <b>mon·o·graphed</b>, <b>mon·o·graph·ing</b>, <b>mon·o·graphs</b><br>To write a monograph on. </span>&nbsp;(Salton, 1975), an article in the January-February
1975 issue of the JASIS (Salton, Yang, &amp; Yu, 1975), and an article
in the November 1975 issue of CACM (Salton, Wong, &amp; Yang, 1975).<BR><BR>The articles in CACM and JASIS (particularly the former) had the
greatest impact on how the VSM came to be viewed. This is largely
because of presentational choices that had little direct bearing on the
thesis of either article. Most significantly, the CACM article is titled
"A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing." One might
consider this an unfortunate choice since (as discussed above) vector
spaces are not essential to the TDV selection and weighting model. What
both articles actually present is an "average document similarity
model" for automatic indexing. Because Salton and his colleagues
were computing document similarity the same way that they had been doing
for years, they used the same mathematical models to explain how those
computations were performed. Hence the vectors and <a onmouseover="t_i(32)" onmouseout="t_o(32)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/vector+operations">vector operations</a><span ID=Tp32 class=hint> <b>vector operations</b><br><br>Extension of the laws of elementary algebra to vectors.

After over a decade of explaining their system design choices in this
way, Salton and his colleagues seem to have grown comfortable with
vector spaces as an economical explanatory tool. That may help account
for why the vector space is foregrounded in the CACM article's
title and in the opening paragraph, which begins "Consider a
document space ..."<BR><BR>In addition, both articles use the same illustration for their
first figure: a three-dimensional <a onmouseover="t_i(33)" onmouseout="t_o(33)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/coordinate+system">coordinate system</a><span ID=Tp33 class=hint> <b>coordinate system</b><br><br>Arrangement of reference lines or curves used to identify the location of points in space.

vectors in the space of term weights. For purposes of advancing and
explaining the thesis this illustration is correct, since it gives the
reader a correct impression of how similarities were computed in the
experiments conducted to evaluate TDV as an indexing strategy. But as we
will see, the figure made a lasting impression on readers, and
eventually more was read into this illustration than was warranted.<BR><BR>THE VECTOR SPACE AS AN IR MODEL<BR><BR>The next significant evolutionary stage of how the VSM came to be
perceived became evident in 1979. That year Salton published an article
in the Journal of Documentation (JDoc) titled "Mathematics and
Information Retrieval." This article was the first since the 1968
text to discuss issues of modeling in depth, and it is significant for
two reasons:<BR><BR>1. This seems to be the first time Salton refers to the VSM as an
IR model in print<BR><BR>2. Salton describes an <a onmouseover="t_i(35)" onmouseout="t_o(35)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/orthogonality">orthogonality</a><span ID=Tp35 class=hint> <b>orthogonality</b><br><br>In mathematics, a property synonymous with perpendicularity when applied to vectors but applicable more generally to functions.

Modeling variables as orthogonal basis vectors suggests that those
variables either are or should be treated as statistically independent
of one another. Salton's vector spaces (such as those in the 1975
TDV articles) model frequencies of extracted words with orthogonal basis
vectors, which gives the false impression that words are assumed to
occur independently of each other. As noted above, however,
Salton's use of vector spaces is for modeling how an IR system
performs particular computations. No empirical claim about word
occurrences is implied: the equations and diagrams merely illustrate how
the system was programmed to match documents and queries.<BR><BR>In "Mathematics and Information Retrieval" Salton uses
the term "vector processing model" rather than vector space
model, and this is the first suggestion that the VSM has shifted from
being understood as a model for illustrating specific computations to
being an IR model in its own right. This article recapitulates much of
the set-theoretic modeling discussion in the 1968 text, but this time
puts alongside it a section on "Retrieval as vector matching
operations." The description of the vector representation and
operations is similar to the earlier computational/operational
illustrations but with some telling exceptions: Salton mentions an
"underlying basis" out of which the vectors representing index
terms are composed via linear combination. Precisely what this basis
represents Salton declines to specify, but he states that to assume that
this basis is orthogonal would be at odds with "actual fact"
since "relationships may exist between individual vector
attributes" (Salton, 1979, p. 8).<BR><BR>The significance of this shift in thinking is twofold: First,
Salton's use of vector spaces has temporarily drifted from the
operational, data-centric conception seen earlier to some other vague
level of abstraction. Second, the question of correlation or
orthogonality is explicitly linked to a modeling issue that Salton had
identified in 1968: the existence of relations or dependencies among the
document and query identifiers.<BR><BR>When Salton alludes to the mysterious "underlying basis,"
he may have in mind latent dimensions of the kind that can be uncovered
through, for example, principal components analysis or factor analysis.
Methods for representing documents in these empirically derived vector
spaces had been proposed before (Switzer, 1965; Sammon, 1968) and since
(Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Landauer, &amp; Harshman, 1990), but the
techniques had not been used in Salton's research. Perhaps the
"underlying basis" is supposed to represent psychological
variables of the kind that can be studied by eliciting similarity
judgments from experimental subjects. Several key studies investigating
the suitability of vector spaces as psychological models of similarity
were published in the years before and after "Mathematics and
Information Retrieval" (Tversky, 1977; Tversky &amp; Gati, 1978;
Tversky &amp; Gati, 1982). But such psychological models were never part
of the SMART system. In any case, the basis cannot represent either the
terms or the documents, since Salton claims that both term and document
vectors are linear combinations of the basis vectors. The reader is left
with the impression of entities that somehow have a real existence
independent of the IR system design decisions and that the system models
imperfectly. What could those be?<BR><BR>Salton may have imagined that the "underlying basis"
represented both empirically derived and psychologically real
dimensions. For example, an article by Koll, published the same year as
Salton's JDoc article, describes a system (called WEIRD) in which a
derived vector space is proposed as a solution to the problem of
measuring conceptual similarity (Koll, 1979). Alternatively, Salton may
have supposed the basis to represent concepts that are neither
psychologically real nor derived from data but rather pure abstractions:
A few years earlier Salton's future coauthor Michael McGill had
published a paper relating SMART to an abstract but informal vector
model proposed by Meincke and Atherton (McGill, 1976; Meincke &amp;
Atherton, 1979).<BR><BR>The other significance of the orthogonality/correlation issue in
1979 is that it is a special case of a retrieval modeling issue Salton
had cited in 1968: relationships between elements of the various sets.
The year 1979 saw the first coupling of this abstract modeling issue
with vector representations that had been discussed separately in the
1968 book. Furthermore, the earliest characterizations of Salton's
VSM as an IR model appeared that year in separate publications by
Salton, McGill, and Koll (Salton, 1979; McGill &amp; Huitfeldt, 1979;
Koll, 1979).<BR><BR>Koll identifies the basis in Salton's vector model as the
index term vectors. Within a few years, Salton would come to agree that
it is the index term vectors (not some other basis) that are assumed to
be orthogonal in his VSM. But that position is equally problematic: if
the basis vectors represent index terms then those vectors are not
assumed to be orthogonal, they simply are orthogonal, because all that
the vectors represent is the way that term frequency data are used in
the system's computations.<BR><BR>When a commentator on the VSM says that term basis vectors are
assumed to be orthogonal, this is a misstating of the actual fact that
dependencies among words in natural language are ignored. Approaches
such as WEIRD and Latent Semantic Indexing do compute and use
information about these dependencies, and although SMART's
similarity computations never worked that way, there is ample evidence
in the writings of Salton and his colleagues that they understood
word/term dependencies and conducted many experiments to employ term
associations in retrieval (Salton, 1963; Lesk, 1969; Salton, Buckley,
&amp; Yu, 1983).<BR><BR>It is a subtle error of language or description to claim that the
VSM assumes term vectors are orthogonal. And it is no coincidence that
this error first appears when the VSM was first characterized as a
retrieval model instead of a computation model. If term vector
orthogonality is a simplifying assumption, then that implies the
existence of correlated terms independent of their operational
definition in the computational design choices. But, as with the
"underlying basis" of 1979, it is not clear what those
entities could be. Evidently, the familiarity of vector space
illustrations has led to a <a onmouseover="t_i(37)" onmouseout="t_o(37)" class=tip href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confounding">confounding</a><span ID=Tp37 class=hint> confounding<br><br>when the effects of two, or more, processes on results cannot be separated, the results are said to be confounded, a cause of bias in disease studies.<br><hr align="left" class="hmshort"/><br><b>confounding factor</b> </span>&nbsp;of objective facts (that term
dependencies and word associations exist) with implications for how
those facts might be modeled (as correlations between vectors in a

But understanding how they shaped the understanding of the VSM itself
requires attention to two issues:<BR><BR>1. Respondents did not realize how recently the VSM came to be
characterized as a retrieval model. Looking back at the earlier

Raghavan's "Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval: A
Reevaluation" (1984). This paper pointed to inconsistencies in
earlier proposals for defining vector correlation. It is the first in a
series that would propose a different method for using word
co-occurrence data to define an orthogonal basis for a vector space;
Wong and Raghavan called it the Generalized Vector Space Model (GVSM)
(Wong et al., 1985; Raghavan &amp; Wong, 1986; Wong et al., 1987).<BR><BR>Beyond these contributions it is interesting to look at how Wong
and Raghavan interpreted Salton's earlier writings and to see the
impact of this interpretation on how we <a onmouseover="t_i(43)" onmouseout="t_o(43)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/conceive+of">conceive of</a><span ID=Tp43 class=hint> <b>Verb</b> <b>1.</b> <b>conceive of</b> - form a mental image of something that is not present or that is not the case; "Can you conceive of him as the president?"<br>envisage, ideate, imagine </span>&nbsp;the VSM today.
Reviewing the 1960s and 1970s publications, Wong and Raghavan suggest
that Sahon's vectors are informal, notational devices and not
intended as a logical tool.

satisfied. According to Wong and Raghavan (1984), that amounts to
"casual flirtings" (p. 170) with the concept of vector spaces
and should not be taken seriously. These criticisms are understandable
in light of how they are interpreting the earlier publications.<BR><BR>As stated earlier, in the pre-1979 writings, vectors are used for
modeling term frequency observations and for explaining similarity and
relevance feedback computations. Salton's vector spaces are
rigorous and formally correct, but the vector models themselves are
illustrative (not merely notational). The axioms defining a vector space
are satisfied simply because at the algebraic level the vector space in
question is the familiar <a onmouseover="t_i(47)" onmouseout="t_o(47)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Euclidean+space">Euclidean space</a><span ID=Tp47 class=hint> <b>Euclidean space</b><br><br>In geometry, a two- or three-dimensional space in which the axioms and postulates of Euclidean geometry apply; also, a space in any finite number of dimensions, in which points are designated by coordinates (one for each dimension) and the distance between </span>&nbsp;of real numbers. The
orthogonality of the basis follows from definition, since what a vector
space represents is nothing more than how computations are performed by
a system such as SMART.<BR><BR>Wong and Raghavan are looking back with the assumption that the VSM
has been an IR model all along. From that perspective, they reasonably
ask whether the VSM implies a vector space in the formal sense. But in
reality the <a onmouseover="t_i(48)" onmouseout="t_o(48)" class=tip href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/formality">formality</a><span ID=Tp48 class=hint> <span class=hw>formality,</span>&nbsp;in chemistry: see chemical equilibrium; concentration. </span>&nbsp;of the vector space was never in doubt, only what
was meant by an IR model.<BR><BR>Wong and Raghavan's GVSM is a perfectly reasonable proposal
for using word co-occurrence data in an IR system. But they present it
as a formal model for vector correlation and orthogonality in IR. The
issues of dependencies and patterns in textual data take a back seat to
questions of how linear dependence, projection, and correlation are
defined.

shape the way theoretical questions were expressed and the language in
which solutions were proposed.<BR><BR>A later response to Salton shows this intertwining of models even
more clearly. In 1993 Bollmann-Sdorra and Raghavan published "On
the Delusiveness of Adopting a Common Space for Modeling IR Objects: Are
Queries Documents?" Recall that, like the issues bearing on
orthogonality, this is another retrieval model issue that Salton had
identified in 1968: whether the request space is identical with the
object space. Bollman-Sdorra and Raghavan address this important issue

Information Retrieval, does not include an in-depth discussion of
modeling issues, apart from a short section on them in the chapter on
future directions in information retrieval. As a result, the book does
not lay out assumptions and parameters of the VSM in detail and, indeed,
refers to the VSM as an information retrieval model only in passing (p.
422). This brief <a onmouseover="t_i(56)" onmouseout="t_o(56)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/allusion">allusion</a><span ID=Tp56 class=hint> <span class="hw">al·lu·sion</span>&nbsp; <br><i>n.</i><br><b>1. </b> The act of alluding; indirect reference: <span class="illustration">Without naming names, the candidate criticized the national leaders by allusion.</span><br><br><b>2.</B> </span>&nbsp;to the "vector space model" may mark
a terminological shift, since earlier papers, as mentioned above, had
used the phrase "vector processing model."<BR><BR>For the most part, the 1983 text uses vector spaces only to explain
and illustrate the computations performed by the SMART system, just as
in the work published before 1979. In section 2 of chapter 4, however,
the authors state that SMART is based on a model in which "Each
term included in a given document or query vector is assumed to be
unrelated (orthogonal) to the other terms, and all the terms are
considered equally important (except for distinctions inherent in the
assignment of weights to the individual terms)" (p. 130).<BR><BR>Salton and McGill go on to explain that the orthogonality
assumption is only a "first-order <a onmouseover="t_i(57)" onmouseout="t_o(57)" class=tip href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Approximation">approximation</a><span ID=Tp57 class=hint> <span class="hw">approximation</span>&nbsp;/ap·prox·i·ma·tion/ (<span class="pronOx">ah-prok?si-ma´shun</span>)<br><b>1. </b>the act or process of bringing into proximity or apposition.<br><br><b>2. </b>a numerical value of limited accuracy. </span>&nbsp;to the true
situation" (1983, p. 130) since words do not occur independently in
texts. They justify the assumption with the argument that taking term
dependencies into account adds complexity and (based on experimental
evidence) seems to have little practical impact on retrieval success.<BR><BR>This discussion is noteworthy for two reasons. First, the
orthogonality assumption is described as applying to the term vectors
(rather than some unspecified basis as in the 1979 article). Secondly,
it is another telling example of the retrieval/computational model
confusion. On the one hand, the authors correctly express a retrieval
model issue, that is, the decision to treat words as unrelated. They
acknowledge that dependencies known to exist between words in texts are
not represented, measured, or used by the system. Salton and McGill
understand the impact that this might have on retrieval results and
explain why they choose to dismiss that concern.<BR><BR>On the other hand, the authors describe this decision in terms of a
vector orthogonality assumption. As explained earlier, term vector
orthogonality is not an assumption but rather a fact resulting from
definition. Indeed, it is not even accurate to describe the retrieval
model as depending on an assumption of term independence; the SMART
system makes no probabilistic inference that could be falsified but
merely computes document/query similarity in particular ways. (2) This
characterization of SMART is another unfortunate consequence of seeing
vector spaces as an IR model. As mentioned earlier, it invited Wong and
Raghavan to question Salton's theoretical <a onmouseover="t_i(58)" onmouseout="t_o(58)" class=tip href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rigor">rigor</a><span ID=Tp58 class=hint> <span class="hw">rigor</span>&nbsp;/rig·or/ (<span class="pronOx">rig´er</span>) [L.] chill; rigidity.<hr align="left" class="hmshort"><br><b>rigor mor´tis</b>  the stiffening of a dead body accompanying depletion of adenosine triphosphate in the muscle fibers. </span>&nbsp;the following year.<BR><BR>Salton's 1989 book, Automatic Text Processing, includes the
author's first full description of the VSM as an IR model.
Ironically, much of the characterization is adapted directly from Wong
and Raghavan's earlier criticism of what they interpreted Salton to
have meant. The illustration of the document space in chapter 10 is an
exact copy of figure 1 in Wong and Raghavan's 1984 paper (and their
1986 follow-up) and depicts the term vectors at <a onmouseover="t_i(59)" onmouseout="t_o(59)" class=tip href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/oblique">oblique</a><span ID=Tp59 class=hint> <span class="hw">o·blique</span><br><i>adj.</i><br>Situated in a slanting position; not transverse or longitudinal.<br><br><hr><br>oblique<br><br>slanting; inclined. </span>&nbsp;angles to one
another rather than at right angles as in the 1975 TDV papers. Based on
Wong and Raghavan's criticism, Salton corrects an earlier (1979)
error on the use of term and document correlations to define an
orthogonal basis and follows their example in calling for additional
information to define the correlations. Citing Raghavan and Wong, Salton
repeats the 1983 mischaracterization that term vector orthogonality
implies an assumption of term independence.<BR><BR>[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]<BR><BR><a onmouseover="t_i(60)" onmouseout="t_o(60)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/epilogue">EPILOGUE</a><span ID=Tp60 class=hint> <span class="hw">ep·i·logue</span>&nbsp;also <b>ep·i·log</b>  <br><i>n.</i><br><b>1. </b><br><b>a. </b> A short poem or speech spoken directly to the audience following the conclusion of a play.<br><br><b>b. </b> The performer who delivers such a short poem or speech.<br><br><b>2.</B> </span>: THE PAPER SALTON NEVER WROTE<BR><BR>As one would expect, published references to the vector model are
usually much briefer than the detailed responses, extensions, and
alternative proposals discussed above. An author may state, for example,
that his or her experimental system realizes or is based on the VSM. Or
the VSM may simply be included in a list of other models or formalisms.<BR><BR>It is ironic that in these references the most popular citations
for the VSM seem to be the two TDV papers, the 1983 text, and the 1971
collection of SMART system articles. These choices are understandable:
the CACM article was suggestively titled, and both it and the JASIS
article included the same <a onmouseover="t_i(61)" onmouseout="t_o(61)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/evocative">evocative</a><span ID=Tp61 class=hint> <span class="hw">e·voc·a·tive</span>&nbsp; <br><i>adj.</i><br>Tending or having the power to evoke.<br><br><hr align="left" class="hmshort"><br><b>e·voc<img align="absbottom" src="http://img.tfd.com/hm/GIF/prime.gif">a·tive·ly</b><i> adv.</I> </span>&nbsp;illustration for figure 1. The 1971
text concerns SMART, the design of which largely defined the loose
bundle of operational assumptions and expectations that people associate
with systems based on the VSM. The 1983 book by Salton and McGill
included descriptions that made it clear that the abstract and
computational modeling issues that had been kept distinct in 1968 were
by then <a onmouseover="t_i(62)" onmouseout="t_o(62)" class=tip href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/inextricably">inextricably</a><span ID=Tp62 class=hint> <span class="hw">in·ex·tri·ca·ble</span>&nbsp; <br><i>adj.</i><br><b>1. </b><br><b>a. </b> So intricate or entangled as to make escape impossible: <span class="illustration">an inextricable maze; an inextricable web of deceit.</span><br><br><b>b.</B> </span>&nbsp;intertwined.<BR><BR>Those four publications, however, are far less significant in terms
of the VSM's evolution than the 1979 JDoc article (which first
presented it as an IR model in its own right), the 1984 and 1986
criticisms by Raghavan and Wong, and the 1989 chapter which finally
expressed in detail how the VSM was supposed to be interpreted. If most
casual references to the VSM ignore these milestones, that probably
reflects a misconception that the operational features and explanatory
devices now associated with the VSM must have been introduced at the
same time it was first proposed as an IR model.<BR><BR>The strongest evidence for such a misconception is seen in the
error of changing the name of one of the TDV articles to "A Vector
Space Model for Information Retrieval" by authors who are citing
the VSM, not the TDV term selection and weighting theory. As stated in
the introduction, even some members of the Cornell SMART research group
have made this mistake, and that has resulted in Dr. Salton appearing as
coauthor on work citing a paper he never wrote. But the real evolution
of the VSM (as people conceived it) is even more fascinating than
citation errors for which Dr. Salton bears none of the blame. What began
as a growing comfort in using vector spaces to explain computations led
to the use of language that suggested the VSM was a retrieval model in
its own right. When Salton and his colleagues were challenged on the
implications of taking that language seriously, they joined their
critics in reinterpreting their earlier writings.<BR><BR>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<BR><BR>I wish to thank Boyd Rayward for his encouragement and patience,
