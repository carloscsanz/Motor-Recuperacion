US $2,049 - the Extreme CPU was the only custom upgrade to my order). Then I&#39;ve ordered 2 modules x 2 GB RAM (total 4 GB, costing me approx. US $140) and 1 TB hard drive (costing me approx US $310). My total cost for the machine and parts was ~ US $2,499 - <strong>saving approx. US $950</strong> than ordering machine with such configuration through Apple (US $3,499 retail). In addition, after the upgrade I&#39;ve sold the remaining parts - 1 GB RAM module and 320 GB hard drive through eBay, <u>hence my saving on my new iMac reached over US $ 1,000 US</u>. <strong>Cool, eh?</strong></div><p align="justify">RAM upgrade was a breeze, just opened up the memory bay slot, plugged in the new modules and closed it up! However, upgrading hard drive proved to be somewhat challenging, hence I wanted to share my experience with the Mac community. Good thing is that I was taking photos as I&#39;ve went along with the upgrade. The result is the following upgrade guide.</p><p align="right"><strong>Danny, 5.

However, Apple made some changes and it is now using hard drive&#39;s internal temperature sensors in order to control the cooling fan speeds and not all hard drives are compatible. In order to upgrade your iMac i5 and i7 (21.5 and 27 inch) models you will need to use Western Digital hard drives only - these are being used by Apple and are compatible with temperature reading mechanisms in iMacs i5 and i7. </p><p align="justify">I would like to thank all readers for their continuous support! </p><p align="right"><strong>Danny, December 2009</strong>. </p><p align="right">Article revisions: Jan-May-Oct-2008.

The glass is held by several magnets only, so you just need to lift it up. Naturally you won&#39;t be doing this with a screwdriver beneath the glass as you will damage the frame for sure. You need suction cups to lift up the glass.</p><p align="justify">If you don&#39;t have specialized suction handle tools, using kitchen \ bathroom hook cups will do just fine. You will need about 4-6 of these, 1 to 2 inches in diameter.</p><p align="justify">Place the suction cups as shown on the photos. You might want to use a rubber string to tie up all suction cups (as shown on the photo) in order to have a grip at all suction cups simultaneously (otherwise you can try lifting up the suction cups with your bare hands ;).</p><p align="left">Just LIFT UP the glass with the suction cups applying some moderate force. Make sure you do it <strong>carefully</strong>, as while pulling <strong>you might damage the glass</strong>!</p><p align="left"><strong>Update 1</strong>:&nbsp;<strong> Some of our readers have managed to get the glass off using only two larger suction cups placed at the two opposite corners of the glass (e.g. upper right and lower left corner), and pulling with hands only</strong> (please check out the comments at the end of the page).</p><p align="center"><table class='multithumb'  cellspacing='0' cellpadding='3' border='0'><tr><td class='multithumb' valign='bottom' nowrap='nowrap' align='center'><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/images/401fb6e2cbe093ea254fcf6b150a68ca.jpg' rel='lightbox[Disassembly02]' title='Taking iMac apart'><img class='multithumb'  src="http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/c0dd41da0df246f586b05745eb676a02.jpg"width="133" height="100" style='border: 2px solid #000000;'   hspace='6' alt='Disassembly02' title='Taking iMac apart' border='' /></a></td><td class='multithumb' valign='bottom' nowrap='nowrap' align='center'><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/images/6719a5168f628f72c8d166eb22d0988a.jpg' rel='lightbox[Disassembly02]' title='Taking iMac apart'><img class='multithumb'  src="http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/8365c8e27fae88d5c1d632546e5f8597.jpg"width="133" height="100" style='border: 2px solid #000000;'   hspace='6' alt='Disassembly02' title='Taking iMac apart' border='' /></a></td><td class='multithumb' valign='bottom' nowrap='nowrap' align='center'><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/images/c0d7cd97075b337dfa7e9c4b5595428a.jpg' rel='lightbox[Disassembly02]' title='Taking iMac apart'><img class='multithumb'  src="http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/58721be10477f87a573605cd45fcddd5.jpg"width="133" height="100" style='border: 2px solid #000000;'   hspace='6' alt='Disassembly02' title='Taking iMac apart' border='' /></a></td></tr><tr><td class='multithumb' valign='bottom' nowrap='nowrap' align='center'><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/images/570d228833f9cd36e117b70932e915bf.jpg' rel='lightbox[Disassembly02]' title='Taking iMac apart'><img class='multithumb'  src="http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/494ccd2b40056fd743625d194ee04e53.jpg"width="133" height="100" style='border: 2px solid #000000;'   hspace='6' alt='Disassembly02' title='Taking iMac apart' border='' /></a></td><td class='multithumb' valign='bottom' nowrap='nowrap' align='center'><a target='_blank' href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/images/fb6ae3a8b8e86f8935a660a662f4ce12.jpg' rel='lightbox[Disassembly02]' title='Taking iMac apart'><img class='multithumb'  src="http://www.amfiteatar.org/mambots/content/multithumb/thumbs/1b3dd53e06ed0573d86642cab4a1d357.jpg"width="133" height="100" style='border: 2px solid #000000;'   hspace='6' alt='Disassembly02' title='Taking iMac apart' border='' /></a></td><td>&nbsp;</td></table> </p><p align="justify">Once you lift up the glass, put it aside on a soft cloth.

	As with one of the user posted, this is by far the best documentation on how to upgrade your Intel iMac (Mid 2007) aluminum.  I just bought one ( refurbished ) with 1GB RAM/250GB HDD, and I was wondering how am I going to upgrade the memory and the HDD.  Through some searching at the Apple Discussions board, I found your documentation through one of the posts.  Great job on this.   <br /> <br />These Intel iMacs (Mid 2007) aluminum aren't as user-friendly as on the G5 iMac.  Just unscrew 3 to 4 screws, pop the back cover and voila, there it is, all at your disposal.  Looks like Apple doesn't want the end-user to tinker the inside....... <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/sad.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/sad.gif' /> <br />	</div>

	Thanks for the post, even that I'm a PC  technician, look a little difficult to do the hard drive upgrade, I mean it's a little too risky, including  messing with the iSight camera, but <strong>well done</strong>. <br /> <br />I have 2 more questions though. Is the CPU upgradeable or it is soldered? In the 20" mac it is possible to use a terabyte  hard drive? I ask this because in the Apple website in the upgrade option shows that you can only install a hard drive up to 500 GB.. maybe a BIOS locked option? <br /> <br />Once again <strong>thanks a lot for showing the light</strong>!	</div>

	Madmac, <br /> <br />In terms of difficulty of the upgrade - it's very relative - the above guide sure makes it a lot easier. I'll quote an editor of the specialized French Mac site Bidouille saying that this upgrade is not too difficult - <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.hardmac.com/news/2008-01-03/'>http://www.hardmac.com/news/2008-01-03/</a>. <br /> <br />The new <strong>iMac aluminum 20" will take 1TB drives</strong> (the motherboard is the same as with 24" model) - although Apple doesn't sell 20" models with 1TB drives, thus you can go ahead and upgrade your iMac 20" to 1TB hard drive. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I believe it is <strong>not feasible</strong> to upgrade the <strong>CPU</strong> in <strong>iMac 2007</strong> models <strong>above 2.8 Ghz</strong> - Apple's 2007 product line. The reason might not be in the actual upgrade (replacing the chip) but in the fact that Apple motherboard (BIOS issue) <strong>might</strong> not recognize the newer CPUs (for example <strong>3.06 Ghz</strong>) in iMac 2007 models. <br /> <br />The only way to test this is through a trial and error - I don't have the time or motivation to do it at this time, perhaps some of the readers will try if newer 3.06 Ghz CPUs will work in <strong>iMac 2007</strong>? <br /> <br />On the other hand I believe <strong>iMac 2008</strong> models will most likely have <strong>no trouble</strong> upgrading the CPU to 3.06 Ghz - as Apple uses the same motherboards for the entire product line (and there is a 3.06 Ghz product in 2008 line up). <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	did this. couple things of note:  1) suction cups are easy, use 4 - one at each corner.  2) make SURE you put all bezel screws in tight/flush (I missed one, cracked the glass, GRR, who knows what that will cost).  3) you can just unscrew the 2 screws holding the drive to the "handle" and then pop it out, transfer the two metal tabs, and put the new one in - much like doing one in a MacBook Pro.  4) be careful of the EMI shield (silver-ish fabric stuff) down by the RAM slots - and also, put the outer bezel back on BOTTOM FIRST - I had to take it on/off 3 times to get it right, all for the want of some silly small things.  5) If you do have that 2nd-set of hands (or good 2 yourself) you can do it without taking out the "blue board" or unplugging the LCD in the 3rd step - but don't crush wires on the left or stretch the power ones!	</div>

	On the glue issue I would not use elmers glue in a computer period.  <br /> <br />You might try Deacon Weld it. On my cloth dryer the rubber sealer ring on the door started coming off about 5 years ago. I Glued it back on and it's still fine. I fugue sustained high temperature might be around 150 F in the dryer. The strength in 900 LBS / IN SQ. <br /> <br />It work well with plastics and metal. Handling time is 5-6 minutes. Time to set is 1.5 to 3 hours. You might want to affix the temperature sensor to the HD with a drop of super glue if you can't get the sensor to lie in the right spot. Two coatings is probably best. Do the second coating perhaps 70 minutes after the first.  <br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.tapplastics.com/shop/product.php?pid=282'>Devcon Weld-It</a> <br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" href='http://tw.video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=1293590'>Weld-It User Review - Video</a> <br />	</div>

	Took me all of about 30 minutes following your excellent tutorial to pop a 1TB into my iMAC 24 AL. Only thing that threw me was once the cover was removed there were 8 Torx Screws to be removed that held in the LCD frame before lifting it and detaching the 3 connectors. <br /> <br />I was surprised how easily the "glass" lifted. I used 2 x 2.5" suction hooks I found a Lowes. They have a hook that when turned down adds suction by puling up on the center of the suction cup. These are used for bathroom showers I think. Then the LCD come up so easy and was so light - plastic I'm pretty certain and I was expecting the weight of glass. <br /> <br />Anyway, hats off and Thank You. 	</div>

	Hi all, <br /> <br />I just replaced the HD on my iMac AL 20", and this tutorial has been very useful. Just a few remarks: <br /> <br />1. it's not necessary to disconnect the iSight cable - just flip the frame over; <br /> <br />2. to remove the monitor one has to unscrew 8 more screws; <br /> <br />3. it doesn't matter which power cables you plug the monitor in; <br /> <br />4. I have a set of TORX T6-20 and didn't need the T4 at all - I mostly used T6 and T9; <br /> <br />5. when one installs Tiger, the HD is not found until it is partitioned with Disk Utils - I guess some HD are already formatted though. <br /> <br />Thanks a lot, <br />Claudio	</div>

	Unfortunately I believe it is <strong>not feasible</strong> to upgrade the <strong>CPU</strong> in <strong>iMac 2007</strong> models <strong>above 2.8 Ghz</strong> - Apple's 2007 product line. The reason might not be in the actual upgrade (replacing the chip) but in the fact that Apple motherboard (BIOS issue) <strong>might</strong> not recognize the newer CPUs (for example <strong>3.06 Ghz</strong>) in iMac <strong>2007</strong> models. <br /> <br />The only way to test this is through a trial and error - I don't have the time or motivation to do it at this time, perhaps some of the readers will try if newer <strong>3.06 Ghz</strong> CPUs will work in <strong>iMac 2007</strong> - please let us know? <br /> <br />On the other hand I believe <strong>iMac 2008</strong> models will most likely have <strong>no trouble</strong> upgrading the CPU to 3.06 Ghz (subject to socket verification inside the iMac!) - as Apple uses the same motherboards for the entire product line (and there is a 3.06 Ghz product in 2008 line up). <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	Mike, <br /> <br />You should be able to follow the above guide - <strong>steps 1-4</strong> in order to get access to the iMac power supply. The power supply is of a modular type hence once you open up your iMac (and remove the display as in step 4), you should have access to the PSU - and you need to simply take out the old and plug in the new PSU module. <br /> <br />Follow the steps 10 and onwards to close your iMac. <br /> <br />Apple machines are usually quality build and very durable. PSU failure (especially if you've had several machines fail) might indicate a potential problem with the in house electricity installation, or simply a problem with the power stability on the part of the grid you are connected to. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend using an <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply'>UPS battery backup</a> as it protects your computer equipment from <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_spike'>surges</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage'>brownouts</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage'>blackouts</a> - my lesson was hard learned as I've lost some of my equipment several years ago due to a thunderstorm (lightning causes voltage surges - a severe surge fries your equipment without the proper protection).  <br /> <br />Since that experience I'm always using an UPS with my system and I've never had a single PSU or power related failure on any of my equipment!  <br /> <br />Investment into an UPS battery ranges from $80 - $140 and is well worth for the protection it provides for your $2000 iMac!!! <br /> <br />For iMac aluminum the minimum UPS size you would use would be <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019804U8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B0019804U8&amp;adid=17N4K3A6AQMGP4Q81VPE&amp;'>APC Back-UPS 550VA</a>, and for iMac and your accessories (e.g. AirPort, Time Capsule, external hard drive, etc), you would need to use a more serious unit <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BFYCUS?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000BFYCUS&amp;adid=1F0KMC5BX9AKNKQMNMPW&amp;'>APC Back-UPS 900 VA</a>. <br /> <br />Good luck replacing the PSU in your iMac aluminum!

	Hello, <br /> <br />I bought an iMac used earlier this year, and took the liberty of not renewing the AppleCare -- I've used Macs for years now, and they're reliable, so I figured I'd spare the expense. Wouldn't ya know that my hard drive up and died within a few short weeks after the complimentary AppleCare ended? Grrr... <br /> <br />I was nervous about trying the repair myself, so I called the Apple store. "Sure," they said, "we'll fix it, but you have to buy Apple parts." Thanks, but no thanks -- my money doesn't grow on trees, fellas. Another local repair shop was just so rude to me on the phone that I wouldn't go within a mile of their store. So, this had to be a do-it-yourself project. Actually, I had a couple Mac nerds at work help me. <br /> <br />The process was a snap, thanks to your guide. The pictures are excellent references. We had the entire hard drive transplant operation done in about 45 min, and my iMac is happily humming along again. And so am I.  <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' />	</div>

I&#8217;ve had experience with various hard drives within the last year I&#8217;ve used in upgrading several iMac machines &#8211; my original Hitachi is working *really* great, it&#8217;s quiet, however runs a bit hot (up to 60C-140F &#8211; this is in the upper limit of manufacturer&#8217;s specification)... I&#8217;ve also had experience with (lower price range) WD Caviar 1 TB (16 MB cache) &#8211; this drive is louder than Hitachi and you can hear it working, runs relatively warm at about 55C-131F. Probably the best drive thus far I&#8217;ve had experience with in iMac machines is the (upper price range) WD Black 1 TB (32 MB cache, SATA 3.0) &#8211; it runs very quiet and also much cooler at about 45C-113F! WD Black was not available at the time of my original upgrade, however it&#8217;s probably one of the best 1 TB drive on the market today. <br /> <br />Please note that temperature of your hard drive also depends on your ambient temperature (it really makes a difference if your room temperature is around 20C-68F or on the other hand around 30C-86F) &#8211; therefore your actual temperature results will wary <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />In conclusion, my hard drive rating on this day [10-Oct-2008] goes as follows: <br /> <br />#1 - <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BWTQ1U?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001BWTQ1U&amp;adid=0GGE5CMRSNFDJ8EGDBPA&amp;'>WD Black 1TB &#8211; quiet, runs cool, , 32mb cache, SATA 3.0, 5yr warranty</a> <br />#2 - <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PDK53E?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000PDK53E&amp;adid=0FYJH48Y1RSFRJNKM8NN&amp;'>Hitachi Deskstar 1TB &#8211; quiet, runs warm, 32mb cache, SATA 3.0, 5 yr warranty</a> <br />#3 - all others <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Please let us know on your upgrade experience <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	Hi, <br /> <br />Thanks a lot for this tutorial-I do have to say that I struggled a bit with the LCD removal on the 20" iMac. That is, until I read some comments that mentioned that I had to remove those screws on the side of the LCD. It wasn't mentioned in the instructions, so I wasn't sure, but after a struggle, I decided to try it, and lo and behold-the rest of the process went smoothly. I now have the WD Caviar 1 TB installed!  I had hoped to use Carbon Copy Cloner to seamlessly copy my existing 320GB system disc on over, but it didn't seem to end up with a bootable drive. Luckily, I also have been using TimeMachine, and I am currently restoring from that!  <br />All in all, not too hard a procedure-I had experience with iMacs in replacing the PSU and midplane assembly multiple times on a 17" G5 iMac, and this was about the same level of difficulty, ie, not too bad at all <br /> <br />Thanks! <br /> <br />Chris	</div>

	Thanks so much for the info on the WD Black Caviar drive; I went ahead and bought it the same day you responded  <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' />  <br /> <br />I was able to swap in the new drive in about a half hour thanks to your perfect step-by-step instructions! (thank you). Unfortunately, my Caviar drive runs no where near as cool as yours. As I'm typing this, I'm showing temps of 135F with an ambient temp of 81F. The room that I am in is showing 74F on the thermostat.  The thing that is making me concerned is that I'm not even doing anything on the mac except responding to you, yet its still in the 130F  range!!??  The mac has plenty of ventilation all the way around including the vents underneath.  <br /> <br />What do you think? Should I take the drive back for a new one before I load it up with data? I'm sure it will fail rather quickly running at these temps, especially considering the max operating temp is 140F (according to the tech sheet).  <br /> <br />Thanks in advance for any advice!!  <br /> <br />-Randy     	</div>

	Hi Randy, <br /> <br />Good to hear you've managed to upgrade your iMac internal hard drive <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' />)) <br /> <br />Your drive does run a bit hot, however as you say still within manufacturers specs (up to 140F, 60C). I would try to load the drive (e.g. start copying gigs of stuff back and forth) and see if it goes over 140F. In case it does, please contact WD support (online chat, email or phone), inquire on the issue, and try replacing the drive (perhaps the issue in your case is with the particular batch of those drives). <br /> <br />I believe that any drive operating within manufacturer's specs will not fail at least within its warranty period - and that being 5 years for our drives hopefully means we'll get at least that much life out of them (afterward we'll need replacing our Macs anyhow). I would be concerned if the drive exceeds the operating temperature (you need to do some testing on this) -- in that case you need to look into replacing it. <br /> <br />Finally, all of my data is backed up on an external drive (I use <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VZCEU8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000VZCEU8&amp;adid=0R2VEB1S44ADQQZHH6X8&amp;'>1 TB WD My Book Studio</a> with firewire 800) through Time Machine - I would *highly* recommend having an external backup drive regardless of the type of drive you are installing internally as having data copied in two places is the only guarantee of possible data recovery in case of drive failure! <br /> <br />Please let us know how it went(?) <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	<strong>In order to cool down the hard drive, you can use a really cool software utility called <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23049'>smcFanControl</a></strong> - use the utility to manually increase the minimum speed of the fan cooling the HDD (the utility also allows you to do the same for CPU and Optical Drive fan). <br /> <br />Standard system setting for HDD fan is 1100 RPMs - if you use the utility to increase this to 1800 RPMs (or even higher), the HDD temperature (as in my case) has dropped for about 9F (5C). You need to experiment a bit - increase the fan speed to various levels and measure how much your HDD temperature has dropped (you also need to allow the system at least 5-10 minutes to adjust to the new airflow - affecting the temperature reading). When you are happy with the effect (HDD temperature drop) leave the settings at that RPM level. <br /> <br />Another utility worth mentioning is <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.islayer.com/'>iStatPro</a> - a system monitoring tool you can use to view your HDD, OD, CPU temperatures (as well as other useful readings such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, network throughput, disk usage, average system load, battery capacity of your wireless mouse, etc.) <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	A couple of questions off the HD replacement issue, but obviously this process of opening the iMac would be the same for accessing other "replaceable" items inside an iMac. <br /> <br />Questions: <br /> <br />Is the graphics card replaceable in the newer aluminum iMac's?  I know the older (white) iMac's had the <br />graphics cards soldered to the logic board ... but I thought I read somewhere that the new iMacs (aluminum) have the graphics cards attached with plug-in connectors. That way Apple can simply fix a bad graphics card with out having to replace the entire logic board, as in the white iMac's. Considering the fact that the logic board replacements are costing around $800 - 900.00 (in the older white iMac's), this makes good sense to have redesigned the logic boards to accept "plug-in" replacements. <br /> <br />Has anyone replaced their graphics cards in the newer aluminum iMac's yet? 	</div>

I tried not to breathe but it took about 20-30 minutes to do the whole thing.  <br /> <br />Also, the backside of the glass had a film that really showed up when we tried to clean it. Lint-free wipes with lens cleaning solution did the trick. I was wishing for canned air.  <br /> <br />One last thing. We couldn't find any suction cups anywhere in the house and used an apple peeler that sucks down to the counter. It even acted like a handle. Now we just need a bigger external drive to back up to. 	</div>

	Copying the data is pretty easy, but take it slowly. These directions are largely product-type independent, but I'll try to drop some hints appropriate for an Intel Aluminum iMac. The description of most of the steps are shortened; I'm expecting a certain amount of intelligence and capability. If it seems like you don't know what a step means, then it might mean the entire process is over your head. I'm not intending that to be snide, just a warning that this is not an easy updgrade... <br /> <br />0) Purchase a new hard drive (SATA) and an enclosure (FireWire or USB2) of an appropriate size (both the new drive and the old drive are 5.25"). Install the new drive in the enclosure. <br /> <br />1) Format the new disk with the appropriate format (using Disk Utility, since you're doing an Intel Mac it needs to be GUID Extended, Mac OS Extended (Journaled), but double check - whatever it is, it should be the same as the current drive).  <br /> <br />Your new drive is now useful, but quite empty. Let's get something onto it. <br /> <br />2) Download SuperDuper (<a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html'>http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html</a>). You don't need to purchase it, but if it's helpful you might want to remember that... <br /> <br />3) Using SuperDuper, copy the old disk to the new disk.  <br /> <br />At this point, you have cloned your disk onto the new drive. <br /> <br />4) Remove the new disk from the enclosure. <br /> <br />5) Install the new disk in the computer, using the above directions. <br /> <br />6) Take that old disk and install it into the enclosure. Voila, instant bonus storage. <br /> <br />Ron <br />	</div>

	Thanks for your quick reply to my previous question. I will be buying the WD Caviar black 1 TB and the Kingston 4gb 800 MZH memory. I've heard about some problems with the Seagate 1.5 TB so I'll pass on that one. <br /> <br />Anyhow, I'm new to mac so I don't really understand the OS yet. As I said earlier I haven't even taken it out of the box yet and don't plan to until I have the new HD and memory ready to install.The OS reinstallation part of it is what scares me the most. <br /> <br />Since my Imac is new I would assume the latest version of OS X would be on the install disc. So would the following apply? <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you have the full version of Leopard OS X, just go ahead and pop in the DVD, turn on your iMac and it will boot from the DVD - just follow the instructions on the screen to install the operating system.  <br /> <br />Please note that once you are booted to OS X Leopard installation you will need to start the Disk Utility in order to partition and format your new 1TB hard drive.  <br /> <br />Is there a default setting during the install that creates partitions the way it came from apple? <br />Any replies welcome. <br />Thanks	</div>

Not sure on the type of the clicking sound you have and how old is your drive (you say it has been used in your earlier G5) - in any case, you might want to consider backing up your data (if you don't have your time machine backup that is) and use some of the Mac diagnostic tools described in this article: <br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=693649&amp;seqNum=3'>http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=693649&amp;seqNum=3</a> <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Thanks for your reply Danny! <br /> <br />I just bought two of those drives 3 months ago. They were brand new. Unfortunately no warranty because they are HP spare parts and are normally not sold without a machine. <br /> <br />Could the problem be caused by installing the drive on its side? When I had it in my G5 it was lying flat. <br /> <br />Something else: the disk is not slowing down my machine, that's also strange. And I also noticed that the ticking is less loud and less often in Windows XP (I have a 900GB partition for OS X and 100GB for XP). <br /> <br />Going to check the site you suggested right now! If the problem cannot be solved I might install my other 1TB that's still in my G5. Maybe this will solve the problem. <br /> <br />Thanks again!	</div>

	Hi Rick, <br /> <br />It also could just be that the drive you are using is simply loud - if using one of the utilities I've told you about earlier shows that everything is OK with your drive. Again, I cannot distinguish the type of clicking you have - usually *very loud* clicking and grinding means the drive is about to go bad, on the other hand a quieter clicking and moving is attributed to a normal operation of the drive - whereas the sound levels depend on the drive quality and type used (please have a look at the recommended drives at the top of this page and user feedback in the comment section). <br /> <br />It shouldn't matter if the drive is installed on the side. However, if you noticed it while installing the drive, the pins on the drive's side go into a round shaped rubber holders that are in fact providing shock absorbing (hence reducing the noise). Perhaps something didn't go right during the upgrade and pins are in direct contact with the chassis transferring the vibrations - again just a hypothesis. <br /> <br />If the problem persists, and if everything is OK with your drive once checked with the disk utility tools, you might revise the installation steps and perhaps consider installing another (quieter) drive. <br /> <br />Good luck, <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Looking at the offering for a CPU upgrade in the future it looks like that anything over 2.8 MHz ( what I have ) is for a 1333 bus since our macs run on a 800 bus would this be an issue or is it just CPU bus speed by what ever the cpu is clocked at ?

Right out of the box I upgraded the drive and the memory with no real problems. I am now installing the operating system.  <br /> <br />1. The glass was easy to pop out with only two large bathroom hook suction cups. <br /> <br />2. It was easy to disconnect the camera wire. <br /> <br />3. It took me awhile to locate the two lower display connectors. <br /> <br />4. I never could disconnect the display power connector, so I just rotated and laid the display  carefully to one side. I then exchanged the drive. <br /> <br />5. It took me awhile to figure out how to format the drive (being new to Mac) and install the OS. <br /> <br />Just take it slow and read all the notes several times before you go for it.

	Hi everyone! <br /> <br />Thank you for your awesome interest in this page! Here are my answers to couple of your questions above: <br /> <br />- Can you use <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YDIA64?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000YDIA64&amp;adid=17XY2VGEVCDBZ6TGNPMQ&amp;'>WD green 1TB</a> hard drive? Yes, by all means, it runs cooler than all other drives and uses the least power -- however you trade in the performance as this drive will perform slower than all other recommended at the top of this page. If you are the type of user that does not require peek performance from your machine, you might consider having this drive. In terms of noise, I don't think other drives (WD Black, Hitachi, Seagate) are all that noisy in iMacs (also a matter of individual perception), so you might not have a lot of gain there. <br /> <br />- In terms of CPU upgrade - higher CPU bus speeds are backward compatible, so if you use a CPU with high freq. bus on a lower bus motherboard, it will work, however you won't be getting the performance gain. Actually the bus and CPU frequency is automatically being determined by iMac boot loader (we'd call this BIOS in PCs). iMac hardware is the same as used in laptops - hence you'd find Mobile CPU socket in there, an optical drive used in laptops, a MXM graphics card used in laptops - it seems Apple uses the same components in all of its product lines (they are all mobile platforms) - it sure saves the manufacturing cost. Having said that, iMac uses "M" (mobile) socket for its Intel CPUs, hence if the CPU you are putting in fits the socket (being M socket), it is most likely it will work and be automatically recognized by the boot loader. I've actually experimented with several CPUs back and forth between iMac 2007 and 2008 (the difference being 800 Mhz and 1333 Mhz bus speed), and they worked well back and forth. The only thing that didn't show up properly was the CPU type in "About this Mac" if you use other Intel Mobile CPUs than the ones used by Apple -- you do get the performance of the CPU though, its just not being recognized properly in About this Mac - but I suppose most of us can live with that for the additional performance gain. I didn't have the time as of yet to write a page on my CPU upgrade experience in iMac -- thanks everyone on the patience though <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />- Upgrading the Optical drive - it requires you to take the right hand side speaker out and to unplug quite a few connectors from the motherboard in order to reach the optical drive. I've actually replaced an optical drive for a friend of mine, it was a bit more complex than upgrading the hard drive, but not too much. Please take a note of all connectors you are pulling out, they must go back where you pulled them from. Luckily they're all different sizes, so you won't be able to mix them up, they're even color coded. The silver part is just a shielding (connected to the ground), and at the end of the day you can live without it. What's important is that drive is connected to its connector at the back giving it power as well as communication with the motherboard - and putting it all back nicely so it fits. Don't forget to plug back all the connectors too! Once I've forgot to plug in a connector, and when I've powered up the machine, the cooling fan was spinning at its max! Had to open the machine again and locate the connector that wasn't plugged in. I took some photos of my optical drive upgrade, hopefully I'll have some time to make a page on this upgrade too. <br /> <br />Thank you everyone for posting your upgrade experiences and issues at this page! <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	If you have the patience you might be successful extracting the stuck DVD disc with a pair of tweezers... <br /> <br />Ultimately you can take the drive apart (you will need precision screwdrivers) and extract the stuck disc that way. The extent of damage will determine if the optical drive is reusable (e.g. if the laser head or some of the moving mechanisms got damaged). <br /> <br />If your optical drive is beyond the repair, you can look for a replacement optical drive online - 8X DVD-RW drives that would go in there are <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BYTE2Y?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001BYTE2Y&amp;adid=06KVGMVQ6Y7GWBS4DY4N&amp;'>UJ-875</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D12HYC?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001D12HYC&amp;adid=1FD2TAAX7579V2PFBBY4&amp;'>UJ-857</a> or UJ-85. <br /> <br />You can actually fit any laptop-style <strong>slot loading</strong> parallel connection (ATA) optical drive in there, even older models UJ-825, UJ-846 and others (these drives are less capable, slower or no DVD recording, you need to check the specs). <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

It was very nerve racking opening up a brand  new (refurbished) IMAC, but taking our time and referring to the illustrations gave us the confidence to do this upgrade. <br /> <br />After pulling the plastic screen with 2 suction cups on each corner, unscrewing the bezel and flipping it over leaving the camera connector alone (it came unconnected by itself after flipping the bezel over), unscrewing the 8 screws that hold the LCD, removing the 2 screws on the LCD connector on the right bottom of LCD (be extra careful not to drop those tiny screws) I did not disconnect anything else (wire on the left side  or the connector under the LCD) to access the HD. I had my wife hold the right side of the LCD up and I was able to reach in and remove and install the new HD. <br /> <br />Reapplying the temp sensor was a little tricky trying to locate it in what you think is the right spot. We put it exactly where it was on the old HD. Just off the center right next to but not on the aluminum circle. I was lucky enough to still have enough adhesive on the sensor holder and foam to stick it back on the new HD. <br /> <br />Putting everything back was easy except for getting the suction cups to release from the screen cover. It took about 10 minutes to gently get them off with the only casualty being one of the guide pins (alignment post) breaking off. <br /> <br />Thank you for for these easy to use instructions for this huge upgrade! <br /> <br />--Mike <br />	</div>

	I managed to do this switch without removing the power cable for the LCD screen.  I just simply had a friend keep it vertical while I did the work on switching the hard drive. My hard drive catty was very hard to remove and took many times more force than I thought it would have. I would recommend unscrewing the handle if yours screen is off - it will make you less nervous. The only other thing with my change was that my glass had some kind of coating on it, and streaked when I placed it on bed. Took many many nervous cleaning of the inside of glass.  I cannot stress enough how thin the glass is, and that it will actually bend if you are not careful.

	I just upgraded to a 1.5Tb Seagate, and while I still remember them here are some issues I encountered. <br /> <br />I used suction cups from a car sun shield. I'd never used the cups as the sun visors hold the sun shield adequately anyway. <br /> <br />Don't tilt the glass too much, it can bend the locating pins. Try to lift it off evenly. <br /> <br />That little connector on the left with the four fine wires going to it is quite tricky to remove. Don't pull the wires or they will come out of the connector, and don't use pliers like I did because they can damage it also. If you can, I think the best thing to use is your fingernails each side of it. <br /> <br />I found it easier to lever off the connector with the two screws than to pull on the tab. It's quite tight. <br /> <br />There's a little piece of plastic with a hole in it, about 5mm x 15mm, directly in the centre at the bottom of the lcd screen. When I lifted the screen it got lifted off where it was mounted. Just be aware of that and don't lose it. <br /> <br />I disconnected the camera connection, but it would be easier not too. I didn't disconnect the main lcd cable, I just tilted it up to get access inside. <br /> <br />Take care removing the cables to the hard drive, the plastic connectors are very soft and seem to mark easily. I undid the screws but still levered the handle with one handle of a pair of pliers. <br /> <br />I put a piece of thin aluminium on the locating pegs of the hard drive and then gripped them with pliers to get the pegs out. I noticed they'd been loctited in, but didn't worry about putting loctite on when I installed them on the new HD. I can't really imagine them vibrating loose. <br /> <br />Replacing the temperature sensor is tricky as the drive was different and I couldn't get it on the exact same spot. Just took an educated guess on that one. <br /> <br />If the lcd doesn't sit evenly when you reinstal it check for wires, especially the camera one if you've disconnected it. <br /> <br />When installing the front cover, it pays to poke that silver conductive tape or whatever it is around the RAM slot in. If it's not tucked in it's hard to get the RAM back in properly. <br /> <br />I cleaned the glass and lcd screen with the cloth from my glasses case. There was a lot of screen removal and replacement as I kept spotting dust on the inside of the glass and on the screen, but I got it pretty good finally. <br /> <br />I only needed a T8  and a T6.  <br /> <br />And now that it's all up and running I've just noticed on the underside of the Western Digital HD I removed there's a SMALL PIECE OF FOAM WITH THAT SILVER CONDUCTING STUFF AROUND IT, STICKING TO IT.  I assume this gets the static electricity off the drive, so tomorrow I'm going to have to go through this exercise again and put it on the Seagate. Wish I'd known about that . . . <br /> <br />Delving into the iMac's innards was an intense experience. Only damage I did was to the lcd connector on the left, but it still seems to work fine. My advice is to be patient and not force anything. Good luck to you all. <br /> <br />	</div>

	Hi Vincent, <br /> <br />Thank you for describing your experience so vividly to us. <br /> <br />I would like to state for everyone here that all connectors are to be handled with your fingers (as shown in photos), there is absolutely no need to use pliers to remove any connector in iMac (and risk the damage). <br /> <br />In terms of the temp. sensor for the hard drive, if the drive is different, you can put the sensor anywhere it fits on the drive as this is an external temp. sensor whose readings are used to calculate the RPMs speed of the cooling fan (the temperature will also dissipate almost evenly through the drive's metal casing), so no worries as to where exactly you put it on the drive. <br /> <br />The foam with the conducting stuff around it, if we're thinking of the same thing, is the EM shielding, and your iMac will work just fine without it (the drive is already grounded when connected) - there is no need to go through the experience again just to put back in that little piece as you won't notice any significant gain or change in performance.  <br /> <br />Thank you for that comment on tucking back the silver piece around the RAM slot in order to make the front panel go back easily - I remember I've experienced the same issue and I've updated the above instructions with this info! <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	First of all, I would like to thank Danny for your awesome DIY!!! And all the others who have commented and shared  their experiences. It was and still is a great read! <br />I am slowly building up  the courage to do this soon, but waiting on your other tutorial concerning CPU and Graphics Card. <br />The reason for this is that I recently had some problems with my late 2007 iMac screen (irregular coloring from left to right, vertical lines etc...) After reading on online what causes it, or possible fixes, I seem to have corrected the vertical line by increasing the internal fans but not the irregular coloring.... <br /> <br />Did you notice any of these problems with your model? <br />Will a Graphic card update solve the problem? <br />Any insights to this would be great. 	</div>

	Hi fatalfred, <br /> <br />Thank you for your post. <br /> <br />It is a well known fact that iMac 2007 LCD screens have discoloration problems (uneven colors, especially at the screen edges) - I've actually had the same discoloration issues with my iMac 2007. Since then I've replaced my computer with iMac 2008 and they have *much* better LCD screens, brighter, stronger colors, fewer discoloration problems. <br /> <br />The only thing you can really do is replace the LCD screen (the issue has nothing to do with the graphics card). If you still have the Apple warranty (or extended warranty), you might want to contact Apple for replacement. Other than that you're out of luck, or couple hundred bucks out of your pocket if you really want to pay for the new LCD screen replacement. It actually might not be that expensive if you purchase one directly from China (Shenzen) and replace it yourself (easy to do, just plug it in). However you'll need to research the Chinese suppliers on your own. Another solution (arguably economically more feasible) might be to sell your iMac 2007 on eBay and buy a new one. <br /> <br />The <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2785594-10480546'>new iMacs 2009 are available</a> as of today with 4GB RAM and 1TB hard drives built in (however still no 1.5 TB models). <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi all, <br />This has been a fascinating read and I've been thinking about tackling it for a couple of weeks.  Anyway, I've just done a "dress rehearsal" by taking of the front panel and was surprised at just how EASY it popped up.  That excersise has given me the final confidence to give it a go - I'll go buy a Seagate 1.5T drive tomorrow. <br /> <br />Anyway, the exercise has also lead to a question/comment.  You keep referring all the way thru to the "front glass panel".  My iMac was bought in late (December) 2007 and I'm pretty certain the panel is plastic - or it definately feels that way.  VERY light, VERY easy to remove and sounds like plastic if tapped - could this be right? <br /> <br />Anyway, let you know how I go after tomorrow.	</div>

	Thanks for the guide, helped a lot. I managed to upgrade a 2008 iMac to 1TB now. However, it went not as smoothly as it should - The LED Temp cable came in the way of a screw when assembling the whole thing again. Yes, the screw was a bit tighter than usual, but I didn't realize I was screwing in a wire actually! Well, after starting the Mac, all fans were at full speed, which was unusual. So disassembled again and saw that the  tape around the four wires of LED temp was damaged. Now everything was clear... probably there was a short circuit there (caused by the Torx screw) and so the Mac believed the LED temperature to be at Maximum, that's why the fans rotated at full speed. Well I was fortunately lucky, the cable was not that damaged, so after taking care there was no screw in its way, the Mac started normally *Phew*.  <br /> <br />Kind of unlucky here though, as the wire must have moved over the hole for the torx screw (actually, it was the second of the long 4 bottom screws seen from the left) while I put the frame back to its place... So maybe the guide should have that caveat... Apart from that, all went well, but 1 or 2 helping hands are a good advice (especially for the LCD connectors...) <br /> <br />	</div>

	Hi Danny, <br />I wrote a few days ago about whether it was a glass or plastic front.  Now I've upgraded my HDD and am wondering whether there are different models for different countries as I've found some other differences which I'll outline.  I live in Australia and my AL iMac was bought in December 2007. <br /> <br />First difference is, as I've stated, the "glass" panel definately feels like plastic - it is VERY light, sounds like plastic when you tap it and came out with no real effort at all. <br /> <br />Next, there are a different number of torx screws around the aluminium frame.  There are 4 across the bottom and top and another 2 down each side.  I read notes stating that they were all different sizes - I actually found that the 4 along the bottom were all the same size as each other and were longer than all the others which were also the same as each other - ie only 2 sizes total. (Hope that made sense) <br /> <br />Next, and this confused and stopped me in my tracks for some time - the 2 cables to the LCD are not the same as your photos.  I eventually found one at the lower left of the board and only by blowing up your photo and noticing the "pull" tab on the other was I able to see something similar high up on the upper edge of the board approximately 8-10cm from the right.  It's almost directly connected to the LCD panel. <br /> <br />Having got that out of the way, I lifted the LCD panel and found, instead of a single power cable to the left, there was 2 pairs of paired cables on the right.  One pair at the top and one at the bottom.  They had small connectors each to matching cables on the LCD so were easy to remove. <br /> <br />After that, everything else was as you've outlined.  I've now got 1.5T of storage up and running beautifully - that tip about booting straight into the Leopard upgrade disc was great and certainly saved some time! <br /> <br />I downloaded and installed some temp monitoring software you suggested and the Seagate drive runs consistently at 49C. <br /> <br />So, it would be interesting to see if there are differences according to the country the unit is sold in.  Great article though and for anyone contemplating, very easy - PROVIDED your comfortable with getting into the insides of a PC/MAC and you know how to take care and patience. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Yours	</div>

	Hi Barry, <br /> <br />I can confirm that my 20" iMac also had only 2 torx sizes for the frame (not 3) and I also found the same cables as you connecting the LCD panel. I live in Austria (not Australia <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/wink.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/wink.gif' /> <br /> <br />The lower one of the paired cables (LCD power) also made troubles after assembling. It somehow got in the way of the fan for the optical drive, which made a weird sound. So I had to open the Mac again (for the 3rd time now - getting an expert in the meantime <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/wink.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/wink.gif' /> and move the cable a bit.

	No that was not the sound I heard when I pulled off the screen.  <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/wink.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/wink.gif' />  But the sound I made when I finished this project.  It was really one of he easiest swaps I ever did.  I only had to remove the video clip on the lower right and the little plug on the left.  Then if you carefully pick up the screen you can slide it back and tilt it u to remove the HD.  I was by myself so I used my trusty OSX DVD box to hold up the screen.  The hardest part was trying to get that damn clip the holds the HD in.  I finally unscrewed it and pulled it out.  I put in a brand new Seagate Barracuda 1TB that was manufactured on 2/17/2009.

	Many thanks for your guide and photographs. I don't think I would have attempted the hard disc upgrade without it. I did however find a few differences to the described for my 2008 iMac. There are Torx screws in the frame of the LCD which need removing once the from Bezel is removed. I didn't need to unplug the camera or the LCD connectors. I hinged up the top of the LCD with a can of compressed air, but anything would do, perhaps a couple of bits of wood would have been better. This gave ample room to remove the drive. I found a T9 screwdriver fitted every screw I needed to remove, even including the locating PINS on the original drive. I didn't want to risk the bathroom sucker approach and purchased a professional suction handle (which consists of two large suckers with air clamps attached to a handle). This cost just under 50 Euro but gives great piece of mind.

	I was weary about tackling this project until I game across this awesome guide!  The detailed photos and write up convinced me to give it a go.  I picked up the tools necessary and had everything done in probably 45 minutes or so. <br /> <br />I got a little hung up on which cables were the LCD cables.  I ended up unscrewing the LCD (8 screws - 4 on each side) and gently lifting it up and seeing which ones you were talking about.  Like another commenter, I ended up just removing the bottom left and right connectors and letting the LCD rest on its side in a towel against the wall.  The third "connector" seemed like there were 4 of them?  A couple on the bottom and the top, but I didn't need to remove them. <br /> <br />Thanks again for the detailed writeup!  I'm going to pass this guide along to some friends that also have iMacs.

	<div class="comment-text" id="comment-text-container-227"> 
	Hi all: <br /> <br />Without sounding like i'm beating a dead horse--KUDOS, Danny, for taking the time to put this together. Like many other commenters here, i was skeptical about replacing the HD to my 20" aluminum Imac as it was the first of the newer Imacs that i hadn't touched yet. G5, powerbooks, macbooks are all cake to me... <br /> <br />But my situation is slightly different. I was prompted to change my internal HD after it seemed to have failed out of nowhere (and 2 months after my warranty was up!)  I was playing world of warcraft when the machine seemed to have frozen and an open-apple, Alt, escape would not get me to force quit the applications.   So a hard restart was in order, but upon restart--the computer couldn't find a start up disk and it wasn't recognizable if i started up as a firewire drive. <br /> <br />I ordered a seagate HD as a replacement and started the process of replacing the drives using your tutorial and getting visual aid from someone who made a video on youtube.  IT wasn't as scary as I thought, and the process took me no more than 10 mins to replace.  <br /> <br />I reassemble the imac and close everything up, start up the machine, install Leopard, do the updates--all of them--and then continue to install World of Warcraft and do all of their updates. <br /> <br />Now, here's the problem i'm experiencing.  The imac restarts fine--looks and works like a beauty--but, whenever the machine's GPU  is 'challenged' and heated up (like, after playing WoW for an hour), i start to notice this fuzziness appearing on the screen. it's an interference like when we used to watch TV and our moms would put on the blender--except its not that heavily 'noisy' and it seems to happen gradually; a few lines here and there--but then gets progressively worse with continued use. <br /> <br />it's been very hard to pinpoint this issue as it appeared to have started as a failing HD issue. But now that everythings up and running again, I'm almost pointing towards the fact that it could be a failing Graphics card (I experienced a similar issue with my old G5 where the graphics card was so overheated that before it failed, it would draw up the screen withi crazy geometric shapes and colors. o.O) <br /> <br />So it's very comforting to hear that i may be able to swap the GPU (i'm very patiently waiting that tutorial), but i'm wondering if maybe there's a cable that I unplugged--but didn't replug. or if there's some shielding that i'm over looking that may allow for interference.   I'm also hoping that someone else out there has experienced something similar only because its so tricky to explain.  I can tell you that all I detached was the camera at the top of the bezel, and the wire that plugged into the motherboard that read the LCD temperature.  When preparing to remove the drive(or reinstall it) there were two sets of wires that run on the right side of the imac connecting the LCD to the motherboard.  I detached both of those--but reattached them before closeing up the machine...  Those were the only things i detached/unplugged during this installation. <br /> <br />Anyone experience anything similar?  Anyone know if there's a snapshot of the inside of these newer imacs with some information as to what wires/parts/sections do what?     <br /> <br />looking forward to hearing from this community.  Thanks in advance! <br /> <br />-Migsy	</div>

Driving GPU to the max for prolonged periods of time will certainly impact the performance of the cooling system, it will also most certainly reduce HDD life and it is possible this is also related to your screen fuzziness issue. <br /> <br />Please let me know if your screen fuzziness is localized at the same place where the HDD is placed inside the machine (upper middle of the screen)? <br /> <br />Also please install <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/istatpro.html'>iStat widget</a> in order to monitor your iMac temperature readings. When the screen fuzziness appears, quit WoW and open the Dashboard in order and tell us what the readings for HDD, CPU, CPU Heatsink, GPU, GPU Diode, GPU Heatsink and Ambient are? <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	Hi Danny, <br /> <br />Thanks for the quick response!  I agree that the heat is my demon.  The computer is on my desk and has decent ventilation around it. But it does tend to get hot when i'm playign the game and i'm not exactly sure what else I can do to reduce the heat. I may have used the smfancontrol app--but that didnt' really help. <br />I've used the machine to play WoW for a lil over a year and it crashed maybe 4 times--and graphically locked up maybe twice.  One time, after a lock up--i kept hearing this beep beep noise and i couldn't get it to stop unless i took the AC adapter out of the outlet. I Restarted the computer  and it was working fine.  Initially, I  thought this was an error on Apples part--this imac is actually refurbished...but i feel like if it was faulty--it wouldn't have performed so well for a year. <br /> <br />OK, back on topic though. If i recall correctly, it looked like the GPU may have been located at the top-left  of the imac, where the HDD may be somewhat more in the center, but the screen fuzziness appears all over the screen. It starts on the upper portion of the screen in a very subtle way, but i noticed the more i use it/the more it gets hot, the more fuzziness i see. Also, when the screen attempts to draw out something in light colors, you can really notice the fuzziness there.   I will have to pay more attention to notice if the fuzziness starts within the immediate vicinity of the HDD.   Also, I ihave installed Istats widget (which i'll have to reinstall since i've reinitalized the Imac again last night--still has fuzzies!) and I think it took  about a 20 degree (c) temp hike before the fuzzies appeared. But I will re-install the widget and i will try to replicate the issue again tonight so that I can include the iStat reports, as well as where the fuzzies start.   <br /> <br />More on this when I arrive home from work.

I have taken screen shots of the iStats utility upon start up, and then took another screenshot when the graphical stuff started to happen.  <br /> <br />Below, should be a link to the screenshots which basically compare the two states.   Looks like my GPU gets annoyed and begins to act up once it gains another 25 Degrees.  Also, what else I noticed is that this fuzziness happens on the top and bottom portions of the screen.

	Hi there Migsy, <br /> <br />I was just wondering if this is iMac design flaw (e.g. do other people have the same screen fuzziness experience when driving their GPUs hard) and what are the heat dissipation specs for GPU? <br /> <br />What you should try doing, as a next step, is to install utility such is <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23049'>SMC Fan control</a> and manually set the speed of all three fans to 80-90% of the scale. Your machine will be noisy, however play WoW and see if the screen fuzziness issue reappears - what is your GPU temperature reading at that point? It's a shame that iMac GPUs do not have their own cooling fan, however the theory that we need to put to the test here is if these three other fans will contribute to additional GPU cool down? <br /> <br />Other than that, replacing GPU might not provide the result if iMacs are really not made for extensive gaming (in order to assess this we need to see if other people have the same issue). iMac GPU is a standard <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.mxm-upgrade.com/'>MXM graphics card</a> found in most of the modern laptops (being a plug and play card which can be easily replaced), however it is very difficult to find an original Apple GPU MXM card on the market and it will cost you an arm and a leg. <br /> <br />On the other hand, one could install a non-Apple MXM GPU card with even higher performances - such as for example ATI HD 3650 - however it would require graphics KEXT strings modification in order to make the hardware recognized by OS X (similar mod as in making sure the third party graphics cards work in Hackintosh builds - PCs running OS X). This is perhaps one of those cool projects one might consider doing - however they require lots of tech knowledge. <br /> <br /><img src='http://www.amfiteatar.org/images/stories/imac_2008-gpu-mxm.jpg' /> <br /> <br />Your other alternative is also to contact Apple support and check with their technicians what do they think of the issue (providing them with particular details, GPU temperature readings, etc). <br /> <br />Finally, an adventurous user might try improving the GPU cooling system in iMacs - for the time being the GPU is cooled only with a passive heat pipe system. Adding a GPU fan or some other crazy approach (water cooling system) might be a cool mod to do as well (however still requiring significant skills and I'm not sure if it will pay off in terms of cost vs benefits). <br /> <br />At this point I would be really interested in finding out if this is happening to other iMac users and if iMac are designed for heavy gaming at all? <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	Danny, Great input. <br /> <br />I have to say i've thought the same thing--especially when my g5 tower seemed to have had its Graphics card burn out (it was the top of the line card for the G5's--nvidia 1600xt maybe?)  and that was under moderate-heavy game play.  For the design for a tower--mysterious. But in the case of portables or compact designs--was it even well thought out? <br /> <br />The first thing i noticed about these laptops and imacs (or compact computing systems) is that they tend to get very hot. My imac and macbook pro can both fry an egg if i've used them to play WoW for 2 hours. But I also figured that these things would be taken into consideration by the engineers who though of putting these things into tinier packages.  /shrug <br /> <br />But the reasoning for me leaving this comment was to see if any other person has experienced this. The imac--though working flawlessly for over a year until this blip--is a refurbished machine I bought from Apple. While these problems did not happen until recently, i'm wondering if they can be attributed to the machine being refurbished? Was this the initially problem that caused the machine to be refurbished? <br /> <br />I'm not completely sure, but I will give the smc fan control a shot. I had it installed before--and didn't really set the fans to 80-90%--but that was because i was afraid of burning out something else! LOL <br /> <br />More on this a little later.  And thanks, Danny, for giving this particularly *interesting* topic some attention and decent advice! <br /> <br />-Migsy	</div>

	Hello Danny/ All. <br /> <br />So i've downloaded and set up the smc fan control and set the fans to around 80% scale. That revved up the fans to an average of 3800-4100 rpms.

I couldnt' replicate the artifacts. <br /> <br />So i shut off the fans to get the machine to operate as it normally does. And after about 1 hour (and   or - a 20 degree increase ) I started to get the artifacts.   The only problem is Its very hard to get a shot of it because its very subtle. So a picture from a digi-cam doesn't necessarily grab the artifacts. and as we know, a snapshot from the computer doesn't actually reveal the artifacts.  I'm going to have to devote some time to burning this machine up again and seeing if i can get a clear shot of what it is i'm talking about. <br /> <br />Anyone know if there's a windows equivalent to this Smc fan control?  Also, how safe is it?  would that blow out the fans in sn overclocking-kind-of-way? <br /> <br />tx! <br /> <br />-migsy	</div>

	Hi there Migsy, <br /> <br />It seems the solution to your problem is to use SMCFanControl. You'll need to experimentally determine the settings for the fans, if the trick worked while running fans at 3000-4000rpm, then work your way down and decrease rpms until you find the optimal speed that cools down your GPU without showing the screen artifacts. I'm sure it will take you couple of days and some patience in order to determine the optimal fan speeds in your case. <br /> <br />Running fans that high won't damage your machine, but you're certainly shortening the life span of those fans - hence the need to have them running at a lower speed (you'll experimentally determine) that solves your issue. If you look at it the long term, even if you burn out the fans (and I believe it will take couple years to truly do that), replacing them is way less costly then replacing the GPU. <br /> <br />Another approach is to leave the fans running normally (at their factory setting) and rev them up just before you play games (also revert the settings once you're done playing). <br /> <br />Good luck! <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	"Invalid node structure" error on my original 250GB HD; Apple wanted $400 to put in an identical drive, and they didn't think they could do any data recovery.  $100 for Disk Warrior to get the data off the failing drive and then finding this guide was like finding the holy grail.  Hadn't swapped out an internal HD in almost 10 years, but using this guide, the installation of my new 1TB drive was easier than that old Gateway computer of the last decade.  Since the data recovery folks were talking $1,000-3,000, I figure I'm a couple of grand ahead right now.   <br /> <br />Thanks ever so much for not only a terrific guide, but also the constant updates and tips.

	I had the "no" symbol and the "gray folder with the ? mark" on it and that was the end of my original 320GB HD, only 13 months after I bought it. Fortunately I had lots of backups with Time Machine. <br /> <br />I bought and installed a new 1TB HD from Western Digital, and had it back up and running in two hours, looking just like it did before the drive died.  <br /> <br />The entire operation was not difficult at all. I took my time and it paid off. The HD carrier is a "quick release" type of set up, not at all hard to figure out how to remove. I pushed the drive itself towards the "pins" side of the mounting bracket, then pushed on the black plastic snap in lock and the drive popped right out. I did all of this without taking the screen out, just levering it up some with one hand and removing the drive with the other. <br /> <br />Thanks again for your advice on the replacement of the HD. I love do-it-yourself computer fixing, proving once again that old labeling of "No user serviceable parts inside".....dead wrong!

	Excellent tutorial! I did have a few questions about drive noise coming from the iMac. I originally wanted to upgrade because of a gargling noise coming from my iMac with the default 250GB drive so I installed a segate barracuda 1TB drive to find out the gargling noise was still there but a bit quiter when data was been accessed I also noticed a constant humming coming from the drive.  <br /> <br />I put back the original Western Digital drive and no humming sound. I took back the seagate barracuda and got a western digital black caviar 1TB drive installed to find a loud gargling noise when data is accessed and also humming coming from the drive if you touch the base of the iMac you can feel the vibration funny thing is if I lift the iMac in the air the humming stops open to any ideas suggestions. Is it possible the temp sensor wires on the hard drive could be causing some type of interferance? Thanks again for this awesome tutorial.  	</div>

	Hi Jada855, <br /> <br />Please reference the earlier post on the hdd noise above "Noisy HDD as of  January 17, 2009". <br /> <br />The drive has to produce a noise, it just depends on what do you consider to be normal or loud. There are three things you need to look into that can relate to this problem: <br /> <br />1. The drive type itself. Some are louder than others. Also, what is your personal criteria of "loud"(?). The absolutely quiet drive (in comparison with all others) is <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000X4PJG8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000X4PJG8&amp;adid=1Z1K03JFXZ8ZXZP5H87S&amp;'>WD Green 1 TB</a> mentioned at the top of this page (however spinning at a lower 5400 RPMs and has a bit slower performance than regular hard drives spinning at 7400 RPM). <br /> <br />I've personally had a HDD noise problem in my other computer (its a PC Hackintosh) and I've had a Seagate 1 TB and Seagate 1.5 TB installed. The 1 TB drive was way much noisier than 1.5 TB drive (I suppose older vs newer technology), although the same manufacturer. Nothing was wrong with the drives, it is just a fact that some drives are louder than the others. <br /> <br />If the minimum noise is your criteria, the only drive I can recommend that will meet the noise criteria of the most demanding is <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000X4PJG8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000X4PJG8&amp;adid=1Z1K03JFXZ8ZXZP5H87S&amp;'>1 TB WD Green</a>. <br /> <br />2. In terms of the installation, wires or temp sensor are certainly not affecting the noise. The only relevant part are the HDD rubber shocks as in the earlier mentioned post (if there is a problem with them, the vibrations are being carried to iMac's metallic bezel). <br /> <br />3. Now, here is a funny thing - perhaps there is nothing wrong with your iMac or the hard drive, but your desk is picking up the resonance (influence of the external environment in relationship with the normal drive spinning resonance, hence amplifying the drive's native resonance). I've had an external HDD sitting on my desk (<a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VZCEU8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000VZCEU8&amp;adid=0AA1M71AASS10WCSMZ5Q&amp;'>1 TB WD My Book Studio with Firewire 800</a>) that was normally vibrating, however while in direct contact with the desk surface, it had its resonance amplified and produced a relatively loud humming noise. Since then I've put my external hard drive an a cheap <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004ZAGC?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B00004ZAGC&amp;adid=04E335KK6D3T3V4F545N&amp;'>standard mouse pad</a>, and it solved all issues - no resonance is being transferred or amplified as it is not in direct contact with the desk's surface. I'm mentioning this as you've said when you lift up your iMac in the air, the noise stops. Well, perhaps its a $5 mouse pad solution in your case too <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> It would be very interesting to know if this solved your issue <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Good luck, <br /> <br />Danny <br /> <br />PS: In terms of hard drives, I believe that <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00066IJPQ?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B00066IJPQ&amp;adid=1A03TS597B1C1EJJSYPT&amp;'>1.5 TB Seagate</a> is the best deal for the money vs performance and the noise. I have 6 of these drives in all of my systems, and I'm very happy with them. Highly recommended!	</div>

	Hello Again Danny, <br /> <br />First off thanks so much for you reply it helped a great deal! I am a designer and my original reason for trying this was the noise coming from the default WD drive inside the iMac. I have tried the following drives WD Black Caviar 1TB 32mb cache was the loudest of them all with a grinding noise for everything even window resizing. I also tried the seagate barracuda 1TB this drive was a bit quieter but I could still hear a grinding noise when data was being accessed.  Upside about the segate 1TB it was SUPER FAST! like my desktop loaded fully 5 seconds fast I was really impressed but the noise was still and annoyance I exchanded this drive for the WD Black Caviar but it was a let down things were starting to look pretty bad at this point one last try enter your suggestion seagate barracuda 1.5 TB unpack  open iMac install did a clean leopard install all was ready testing windows opening,applications etc not a sound tears of joy began to spread this could be it currently now doing a time machine restore and really put the data accessing to test I will let you know how it goes.  <br /> <br />As for the humming coming from the iMac I beleive it's caused by the terabyte drives with the original 250GB no humming at all so it maybe safe to say I did not tweak anything when opening.  But again I did what you suggested put a small pad between the desk and iMac and no humming noise. It seemed like the humming noise was going right through the desk once again thanks for the help on that part. If all is quiet after time machine restore that would be awesome. I may try and tackle the GPU next once the tutorial is complete I would not mind a 256 or 512 card <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> thanks again for the help and reply much appreciated.  	</div>

	If the temperature sensor is damaged, that can result in a lot of additional fan noise. I had a drive die in a late white plastic iMac and the sensor went bad somehow. I got it back and it sounded like a plane waiting to take off. The noise was impressive for its volume... <br /> <br />I got a replacement and all was well. <br /> <br />I found this post while contemplating a DIY drive upgrade and will put more thought into it before I risk my system and Applecare.

	Hi Danny, I just wanted to leave you a quick note and thank you for the excellent tutorial. My HD died yesterday, so I read your guide and went out and bought myself a 1.5TB Seagate Barracuda, a set of Torx screwdrivers, and some bathroom suction cups. Got some extra RAM while I was at it. <br /> <br />I followed your tutorial to the letter, and it worked out brilliantly. It took me less than a half hour to take it apart, install the drive, and put it back together. I had a full Time Machine backup, so I'm currently in the process of restoring my system. <br /> <br />Without your guide, I wouldn't have had a clue how to do this. So thank you, truly. You've made this Apple fangirl and her iMac really really happy. <br /> <br />Hanna	</div>

	Hi there Fred, <br /> <br />1) The decision is really yours. Do you have any issues with 1TB  external drive? The Seagate drive issue with old firmwares is really one in thousands that you'll have problems (data loss in very rare occasions)  - so the question is do you really have problems with the external drive? do you have any critical data on the external drive that would require extra precaution and firmware upgrade? <br /> <br />In my personal opinion, I think it would be prudent to put the 1.5 TB in your iMac (also because this is a quieter drive than 1 TB Seagate and a newer technology), and in case you have problems with your external 1TB, it shouldn't be too difficult to find a friend with a PC to upgrade the firmware (and also if you experience problems with it - if not you just might leave it as it is) <br /> <br />2) This is my experience on this one - I've tried using newer Leopard 10.5 discs on an iMac 2007 and it didn't work - it detected the machine type and said that the discs are not compatible with this model. On the other hand the new discs worked on iMac 2008. So you should try with the new discs and see how it works out for you. You can always execute the plan B) installing Tiger and then Leo. Also, if you have Leo upgrade disk - the one you used to upgrade Tiger - then you are all set, because if you look at some of the early posts above, you can install straight away (without installing Tiger first) from the Leo upgrade disc, however the trick is to tell it not to do the install, but a recovery from the Time Machine -- when you get to that screen, just click back and do a normal install (this way the upgrade disc will think it is restoring a previous install, rather than installing from scratch and looking for Tiger). <br /> <br />Please let us know how it worked out for you! <br /> <br />Take care, <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Ok here we go. About 2 months ago my computer crashed and I got the white screen. Every thought it was a hardware problem with the hard drive. Finally I took it to genius bar (no warranty) and they fixed it with Disk Warrior. I then bought a Lacie 1TB external so that I could back up my system just in case they didn't fix it for good. <br /> <br />After I set up the external hard drive, I partitioned it. Half for time machine the other half for my ps3 (movies, music, photos) and everything worked great. I erased and re installed leopard just in case and then booted with time machine and everything restored and was running better than ever. <br /> <br />Now 2 weeks ago my iMac crashed again, (white screen with ? folder). I unplugged everything and went to bed. This morning it started up so I hooked up my external (which wasn't and hasn't been hooked up to the iMac since initial back-up) in order to back up all my new stuff, however I noticed that the iMac didn't recognize the time machine partition, only the PS3 partition. I ran disk utility and it could not repair the time machine partition which was now named disk01 or something like that. A few minutes later it froze and crashed. <br /> <br />any advice? <br /> <br />I bought a new internal (640 WD Caviar Blue) but have not installed it yet. <br />	</div>

	Hi there Vince, <br /> <br />From what you are saying it sounds your internal hard drive is failing. While <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/index.html'>Disk Warrior</a> might have seem to repair it, this software utility (nor any other software as a matter of fact) can repair a failing disk. HDDs are mechanical devices and sooner or later they will fail (<a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_drive_failure'>more info on HDD failures</a>). When they start to fail bad sectors start showing up (irreparable areas on the disk's data platter). What Disk Warrior (and other utilities) do is they mark these bad sectors as unusable and they move data around (Disk Rebuilding process). Therefore, it might seem disk is software repaired, however its mechanical failures are not and disk has just been "patched up" with software (being only a *temporary* solution to the problem). Once bad sectors (mechanical failures) start showing up on the disk, they are very likely to spread very fast causing additional data damage - which might very well explain your second HDD crash in two weeks. <br /> <br />What I would recommend is that you install your new HDD in your iMac and install Leo OS X. Do not worry about not being able to access your backup at the boot or DVD install time, just do an install without Time Machine recovery. Make sure Leo is running. Then you can start <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Assistant_(Apple)'>Migration Assistant</a> (located in Applications then Utilities) and recover your data from the external drive (it will provide you with Time Machine or external HDD drive data migration option) - I'm sure that at this point the system will be able to recognize the appropriate partition. <br /> <br />Save the old drive - just in case your data backup from the external drive doesn't work. You can attempt to reconnect your old failing drive through an external enclosure and run DiskWarrior to try to fix it and use Migration Assistant to import data onto the new hard drive. <br /> <br />Please let us know how it worked out for you. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Thanks Danny. I will do that as soon as I can. A couple questions though if you dont mind. <br /> <br />How hard is this (installing HD) to do it myself? The only thing I am nervous about is the LCD screen (dead pixels, dust etc..) <br /> <br />Also, are you confident that migration assistant will find the TM partition even though it came up bad when I ran disk utility on it?  <br /> <br />Even if it did find it shouldn't I stay away from putting it on the new internal since it messed up my external, won't it mess up my new internal?? <br /> <br />What do you think?

	Vince, <br /> <br />1. Your decision if you'd like to proceed with the upgrade very much depends on your previous experience and skill set - for some people this is a breeze, for others its hard to do. DIY is available at this page, many readers have reported successful installs, however you're fully responsible for the consequences yourself in case something goes wrong. On the brighter side, if you are very very careful in handling the display and other components, the likely hood of everything going well is pretty high. If in doubt, perhaps it's a good idea to have a friend assist you, and finally you might opt to hire professional assistance locally. <br /> <br />2. It was only my best guess, that's why I've recommended you to keep the old drive. <br /> <br />3. This shouldn't be an issue in your case as the reason for "messing up" is very much different than what might really "mess up" the current Leo installation - and that is various erroneous settings in "Preferences" folder and other system files. If in doubt, when using Migration Assistant don't tell it to transfer all user settings, just files, and you should be 100% OK. <br /> <br />Good luck. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	You should be fine with a single partition only. Splitting partitions to OS and Data is something people would usually do on a PC - in case when (not if) your Windows partition crashes you still have your data saved on the data partition - not necessary for Mac. The whole deal with data protection for Mac is to have an <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VZCEU8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B000VZCEU8&amp;adid=0R2VEB1S44ADQQZHH6X8&amp;'>external hard drive</a> for automated Time Machine backups. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

If you have a crash - and I've never had a Mac crash, the only reason I was recovering files from Time Machine was when swapping hard drives - there is Migration Assistant in Applications, Utilities - it allows for recovery of Time Machine data with a single click - almost the same as with the ghost image - just built into the OS. The Time Machine is also unbelievably useful when you delete or lose files you need - just click on the Time Machine icon at the dock and you can recover your files for as long in the past as there was hard disk storage... <br /> <br />In order for Time Machine to work you need an external hard drive. You can go with USB (480 mpbs) or Firewire 400 or 800 (mpbs) -- so it is really a choice between USB or Firewire 800 (as firewire 400 is the same speed as USB, just more expensive).

	First off, thanks so much for such a detailed guide!  I purchased an new 2008 imac on clearance about a month ago.  I replaced the factory hard drive on a 24 (200<img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/cool.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/cool.gif' /> imac right out of the box, with a WD Black 1TB drive.  Everything was going so well, until a few days ago, when I noticed the iStat reading for the CPU Fan was 000RPM....  I tried an SMC Reset and a PMU Reset to no avail.  Even tried "Fan Control" and SMC Fan Control... nothing can startup the CPU fan.  Couldn't find any similar @ Apple support or via Google.  Anyone have similar issues after a hard drive upgrade? <br /> <br />Has anyone who has replaced their HD try to submit their imac to apple for repair?  Would they accept it under Apple Care?  I was told by one of the Apple retail staff that for the factory warranty to be applied, other than ram, the imac needs to have all its original factory parts.  Any thoughts?	</div>

	I came across this article several months ago and contemplated increasing my internal HDD in my '07 24" iMac from the 320GB, but never got around to it.  Yesterday my HDD died and forced the issue.  I went to Frys and bought the WD Black 1TB.  With this guide and my Time Machine backup to restore with the Migration Assistant, I was back up and running in just a few hours with virtually nothing lost.... Awesome!!!  I am now a firm believer in Time Machine....  Only issue was that my password didn't work on restart.  Had to boot from the CD and use the password utility to reset.

	I dumbluckily bought an external backup drive and turned on Time Machine about 3 weeks before my original HD died. First HD failure in 12 years of apple ownership. My iMac G3 is still humming along downstairs serving up FTP and DVD's for my kids. Never a day's worry with that old mac. I always back up important stuff but never had a "backup system" in place at home. The good luck of having Time Machine running far exceeded the bad luck of HD failure. Time Machine is sweet.  <br /> <br />This guide is fantastic. Pulled off an HD replacement in 30 min. Didn't disconnect any cables. For a non-user modifiable machine, it sure was easy to pull apart and put back together with this guide. With all the plastic iMacs in the past I could never quite put them back together. They never looked quite right after. This aluminum model went back together with the same ease of pulling it apart. Thanks. Wouldn't have dared without this guide.  <br /> <br />Replaced my failed WD 500GB with WD Black 1TB. Restore went smooth. The problem I have now is TEMPS and wondering if TEMP played a role in my original HD failure. Machine just feels hot. More so than other iMacs (G5 and other Intels I frequent).  <br /> <br />I installed smcFanControl and iStat Menues. They display different TEMP readings for the HD. Whats this all about? smcFanContorl says 51C. iStat Menu says 60C. What temp sensor is smcFanContorl using? None of the temps in iStat Menu read 51C. I can't tell where the smcFanContorl temp readings are coming from. One of the readings has to be wrong.  <br /> <br />I tend to believe the 60C. Should my WD Black 1TB HD be running at 60C all the time? I installed last week and it runs at 60C pretty much no matter what I am doing on my machine. Says 61C right now. That is hot! smcFanControl doesn't seem to cool it down. I worry about fan failure running it at high RPM. Should I worry about fan failure? <br /> <br />Should I expect this new HD to fail because of the heat? Or is it just an over achieving, high performance super disk that likes to run at higher temps? It was fun digging into the iMac and fixing it but I don't really want to do it again.	</div>

	Hi there, <br /> <br />One of the sensors is measuring temperature external to the drive (that is the sensor you've glued onto the drive) and the other sensor is internal within the drive itself. Therefore, I believe that the external temperature of your drive is 51C and the drive's internal temp is 61C. That is hot! It should also be interesting to see what is your environment temperature like. Most of the drives specify 60C as the upper max. operational temperature. The solution is to rev the fans higher to compensate with additional cooling. Sure, you can run them down, however in couple of years, so I wouldn't be that much worried about it. Another alternative if you really have HDD temp problems is to go with the WD Green drive which produces the lowest temp of them all. Other than that, just make sure you use that Time Machine of yours <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />All the best, <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi Danny, <br /> <br />Thanks for your quick response and of course for the amazing article. <br />Thanks to you opening an iMac has become a pretty simple task. I've already opened it today and reattached the HD temperature sensor in a different location but still the fan runs like crazy. <br /> <br />As you wrote in one of your updates I managed to replace the HD without removing the display - I used another pair of hands to hold it for me and just detached the two connectors on the back of the display. Is it possible that those connectors below the monitor cause the fan to run so fast if they are attached inproperly - you didn't exactly specify how those should be attached and I didn't remember that after detaching them. But the display works fine - so I guess the mistake isn't here.. <br /> <br />This time I'll remove the display and take a look if there's nothing missing - I hope it will finally work. Otherwise I'll have to manage with the fan running so fast (although I think it might shorten its life a lot).. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Max	</div>

	Hello Danny, <br /> <br />This evening me and a friend of mine installed two 1.5 TB seagate drive's in a 20 and 24 inch imac from 2008. We found out that there is a difference in between the power cable of the 24 and the 20 inch screen. <br />The 20 inch is easier with the four connectors on the right side as the 24 inch model has only one flat cable on the left side. We did not disconnect this one. <br /> <br />After a time machine recovery everything runs perfect. <br /> <br />Thanx again for the great DIY. <br /> <br />Harold and Richard <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' />	</div>

As they are very small (and if like me you have big fingers&#8230;) you can loose them in you iMac. So,  you can touch one of the magnet on the front panel with your screwdriver.

	There's more than enough info here in your tutorial; it's incredibly helpful.  Put a 1TB fujitsu in my sister's iMac today.  Only used one suction cup to pull a corner off and plucked the rest off by hand.  Never disconnected anything but the HD thermometer.  I kept the display propped up with a small water bottle like the hood of a car and the swap went really smoothly; about 20 minutes total.  Of course the OS install and software updates took hours and hours ^_^	</div>

	Hi Derek, <br /> <br />In order for one of the fans to run at max., you must have not plugged back (or properly) one of the cables. If all seems plugged in, make sure they are all the way down inside a connector. You need to go inside your iMac again and you can reference pictures from this guide to check where each of the cables is going to. As there is no reading from one of the sensors, it provides a false reading to the logic board who believes your iMac is hot on fire, and as a consequence fans are screaming aloud <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

The funny thing is, I didn't mess with those cables in any way (at least to my knowledge).  I only unplugged the LCD power cable which is near them.  Perhaps something got loose in the process but I can't see how. <br /> <br />I'll open 'er up again tomorrow.

	Hi again Derek, <br /> <br />One of the readers above had a screw go through a cable when he was closing up the bezel -- you might encounter that kind of scenario in your case too -- or as you say one of the connections just might got loose. In reference to your question which one -- please make sure you check *every* cable, not just the sensor cables (I believe there are three of them), in order to make sure ALL cables are connected properly, especially in the case you suspect some of them got loose (which visually might appear as connected). <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Yikes.  No, I didn't take out the logic board itself.  I didn't even know where to start on that one.  It seems like I'd literally have to take the entire thing apart.  Although at this point, I'm willing to give it a shot. <br /> <br />Is the sensor just a wire that goes into a connector?  Like, is it plausible that it came loose somehow?  I haven't been rough with this thing at all, and I don't recall tugging on anything that I shouldn't have, but I'm just curious how likely it is before I gut this thing.	</div>

	Don't take apart the logic board, I was just wondering! Its just a plug on the other side of the board. I'm sure that's not it because there is no way that could have got loose if you didn't take the entire motherboard off. <br /> <br />I was just Googling that error code and came across a Linux implementation of temperature read out for iMacs, it is definitely an error code pointing to failure of one of the temperature sensors. Now just to figure out which one. At this point I could take a wild guess and assume the HDD sensor is somehow damaged. <br /> <br />Another wild guess, hard drives have an internal temperature sensor as well. This wild guess would be that perhaps something is wrong with your HDD. Which type did you install? Do you have your old HDD drive sitting around? Perhaps another swap? <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Yeah I've been googling too.  I actually found one page (a lot of it was in German) which says it might be the LCD temp sensor, which is entirely possible as I may have dropped the screen on it when putting everything back together (although I'm not sure, this is just a guess).  Regardless, I think this is gonna have to go to Apple. Hopefully they'll know what the error code means and can replace whatever needs replacing without breaking the bank.

	Hi Olav, <br /> <br />In terms of the <strong>hard drive recommendations for this project</strong>, I wouldn't go with Seagate 1TB at this point as it has more than one and a half year old technology (and that is light years in technology). <br /> <br />You won't go wrong with <strong>choosing either of the following 1.5 TB hard drives</strong>: <br /> <br />- <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00066IJPQ?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B00066IJPQ&amp;adid=0D247A9P4EH6Q9BQV349&amp;'>Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 1.5 TB SATA 32 MB, 7200 RPM</a> <br />- <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0021L9HE6?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B0021L9HE6&amp;adid=1S2XCRGF6H7C1RSGYX4N&amp;'>Western Digital WD15EADS Caviar Green 1.5 TB SATA 32 MB, up to 7200 RPM</a> <br /> <br />If we look into technical specifications of these two drives, the following is the <strong>comparison between these two drives</strong>: <br /> <br />- Sustained transfer rate: WD Green 100 Mb/sec vs Seagate 120 Mb/sec <br />- Cache: both have 32 MB <br />- RPM (rotational speed): WD Green - variable (InteliSeek - this is a new technology to reduce power and noise) vs Seagate having continous 7200 RPM <br />- Power consumption: WD Green - 6W while at full power (read write) whereas Seagate uses 8W while at full power <br />- Noise levels: WD Green 29DBA at full performance whereas Seagate has 32 DBA at full performance (hence a small difference) <br />- Operating temperature: WD Green up to 60C vs Seagate also up to 60C <br />- Manufacturer's warranty: WD Green has 3 years limited warranty vs Seagate 5 years limited warranty <br /> <br />In conclusion, the noise levels between two drives makes a really small difference 29 vs 32 DBA (in favor of WD Green), whereas the power consumption is only 2 Watts between these two drives (in favor of WD Green). Seagate has faster performance for sustainable data transfers - 120mb/sec vs 100mb/sec for WD Green. The major difference is that Seagate extends 5yr limited warranty whereas WD has 3yr warranty only. <br /> <br />If you budget permits it at this time, you might actually consider <strong>upgrading your iMac to the latest technology - 2TB hard drives</strong>. I would <strong>recommend</strong> one of the following two models. Price vs warranty are your main choice parameters rather than tech specs as they are pretty close one to another (competition is great) <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />- <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028Y4CY6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B0028Y4CY6'>Seagate Barracuda 2 TB drive, 32 Mb cache, 7200 RPM</a> <br />- <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RB1TIS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B001RB1TIS'>WD Green 2 TB drive, 32 Mb cache, up to 7200 RPM</a> <br /> <br />Good luck upgrading!

	That might be, but Series 12 is available only up to 1 TB and Series 11 up to 1.5 TB, whereas a completely new series was developed by Seagate called LP (Low Power) for 1.5 and 2.0 TB drive (according to <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.seagate.com'>www.seagate.com</a>).

	Guys, it is very easy to swap out the HD without removing the LCD cables. Simply tilt the LCD up on the iSight side about 4". (Your iMac shouoold be laying on its back.) No need to remove the LCD. Then reach in and pull off the temp sensor on the HD. Pull off the two SATA connectors on the left side of the HD. Press the latch and pop out the HD. You needlessly risk messing up one of the LCD connectors by unplugging them. Easier if you have someone to tilt and hold the LCD but I did it myself tilting the LCD with one hand and removing the HD with the other. 	</div>

	Thanks for the tutorial. I wrote a similar tutorial for upgrading HDDs in MBPs. I used Carbon Copy Cloner to move over the data from the old HDD to the new one before swapping the drives. I decided to use the same process when upgrading the iMac AL as well. <br /> <br />A couple tips people might find helpful: <br /> <br />- When completely done with everything, go into "System Preferences >> Startup Disk", if your new disk isn't already selected, choose the new drive, and restart (your bootup will be much faster now). <br /> <br />- The original iMac AL (first Core 2 Duo model) can actually go up to 6GB (same with the first MBP Core 2 Duo).  I own both (and have upgraded both to 6GB).  The reason why the specs on both models say 4GB max is because back then there was no such thing as a 4GB laptop memory module. The nice thing is that Apple tends to go beyond simple specifications and build their machines better than their specs (or so I'm told). Technically you can put up to 8GB of RAM in these models and OS X will register it correctly, but people will tell you that as soon as your machine goes to use any RAM past 6GB, the OS crashes. If you already have 4GB in your iMac AL (2007/2008 model) and want to upgrade to 6GB, you need to only replace one of the chips with a 4GB module (they will be compatible).   <br /> <br />Thanks again for the great tutorial/walkthrough.  Good job and very helpful!	</div>

	I've read all the entries on this subject I found them very useful. However, I'm running into a dead end with my iMac 24" aluminum. I got a generic drive from OWC that the computer recognizes as MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ-875S.  The people at OWC assured me that this is the correct replacement part. Does the S after UJ-875 mean anything special? Is it a different part? Secondly: I installed the new drive without any problem, in mechanical terms, but when I try to use it, the CD/DVD will not be "pulled in" by the drive's mechanism, it behaves as if the drive were not connected to power. This will happen no matter how deep I push the disk in. Third: the drive has an ATAPI connection. The original one had also a wire with a black end pegged to its underside. It was held in place by a plastic casing that was covered by a piece of foam that has a sticky side. This wire end is rounded on one side, black in color, and the other side in silvery and flat. I do not recall which side was touching the metal underside of the drive, but I have tried putting it in the two possible positions but always get the same dead end: the drive does not emit any sound nor pulls in the disk. Your hel will be extremely appreciated. H E L P, please.	</div>

	Hi Derek, <br /> <br />Congrats on resolving your issue with the temp sensor!!! I guess some sound from the drive is normal, especially if you're crunching torrents (it needs to save data every second). For purpose of torrenting, I would actually use some less expensive machine - e.g. installing a Transmission bit torrent client on a NAS storage (i.e. Linux based), or Apple TV (that is if you have any of these). I've actually managed to compile Transmission 1.72 on Apple TV the other day so I do not need to leave my Mac running all the time.

	Hi Danny, <br /> <br />A great document you have assembled! <br />I have a few questions though. My iMac is a November 2007 alu 20" model and its model number is A1224. I can't see that model in your list at the top of this page. On the other hand I can't find anything that resembles one of the model numbers you mention there on or in my iMac. <br />My next question concerns the CPU. Can you tell me, or anyone else, which CPU do I exactly need if I want to upgrade from the original 2.0 to a 2.8 GHz? <br />Thanks in advance. <br /> <br />charles	</div>

	Hello Danny, <br /> <br />I have completed the upgrade of my 20' iMac successfully. I decided to go with the latest <strong><a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RB1TIS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B001RB1TIS'>2TB WD hard disk</a></strong> even though it was a bit more expensive. <br /> <br />With the help of your instructions and the photo's which I had at hand on my macbook (always nice to have two computers) it was very easy to do. <br /> <br />A few minor details, my display was attached to the main body with screws as well. And I succeeded in disconnecting the connector in the upper right hand corner and then lift the display up from the top. I 'secured' the display by leaning it against some styrofoam and a wooden kitchen spoon which gave me enough room to get to the hard disk. <br /> <br />In the end it was all very easy, I had no parts left (always a good sign) and my iMac was up and running within 45 minutes. I decided to do a clean install and manually import whatever I felt I still needed and get rid of all the stuff I had downloaded and was not using anymore. I have now 1.3 TB available space!! <br /> <br />What is <strong>the most impressive thing about the upgrade is the noise or lack of it. My iMac is now dead quiet</strong>, a very welcome change after the noise of my old hard drive. The upgrade would have been worth it just for that reason. Many thanks to your manual, much appreciated. <br /> <br />Olav	</div>

	Well, I'm not sure what to do.  My iMac won't boot up.  Spins and then turns off.  Took it to Apple store.  They said the hard drive's going bad and it's 275 for a new one.  I said no thanks.  Bought a Seagate 1.5 and planned on changing it myself.  I looked for my Leopard disk and can't find one.  THis was a refurb. mid 2007 but I'm sure they sent one.  I do have a usb enclosure.  Of course, I didn't back up my computer but there's really nothing on there that's not on my MB Pro.  Can I take Leopard off the MB Pro somehow?  Should I take out the bad drive and try to see if it works in the enclosure.  I haven't tried Disk Warrior but they probably did at the Apple store.  They tried to get it working while I was there and tried a bunch of stuff.  Any thoughts for me? <br />Thanks	</div>

	Hi there Becky, <br /> <br />You can always order replacement Leopard discs from Apple - every Mac owner can order replacement discs for the cost of media only and I believe this is $34 (at least that's what I've paid couple months ago when I lost my MB Pro install discs). On the other hand you can always borrow your friend's discs... <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />In your case, you should install the new 1.5 TB hard drive and do a clean Leopard install. Then connect your old hard drive to an external enclosure and attempt to recover some data from it. If unsuccessful (and I'm skeptical you'd be able to recover data from it if it is badly damaged as you described it), you can always transfer data from your MB Pro. <br /> <br />Danny 	</div>

	Hi there Mark, <br /> <br />If the hard drive is installed and connected properly (power and the data cable), the <a rel="nofollow" href='http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1440'>flashing question mark "?" folder</a> is quite normal as the system is trying to boot an operating system and it is not finding it. <br /> <br />Inserting an OS X install DVD might not start automatically by itself, so what you need to do is restart your machine and hold the OPT key just after the chime sound. You will get a graphical boot menu in which you have to <a rel="nofollow" href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310'>choose the DVD volume (OS X install disc) to start the system from</a>. Once the installer starts, you need to find <a rel="nofollow" href='http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8494.html'>Disk Utilities in the navigation menu to partition the hard drive</a>. Once the partitioning is done, you can proceed with <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/install/'>OS X installation</a>. Once the installation is completed you should be able to boot the system from the hard drive and subsequently run Migration Assistant (from Utilities) to import data from your old hard drive (i.e. connected to an external USB enclosure). <br /> <br />On the other hand, when manually choosing to boot from DVD (holding the OPT key down after the chime on reboot), if it cannot find any hard drive in the disk utilities (you must start Disk Utilities once in the OS X installation menu), it might happen that the system is not finding any hard drive - in such case you have to make sure power and data cable were properly attached during the installation. <br /> <br />Hopefully it is just the manual selection to boot from the OS X install DVD in your case. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi again Mark, <br /> <br />The normal operation after holding the OPT key on reboot is to get a menu <a rel="nofollow" href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310'>depicted exactly as in this article</a> which will allow you to choose DVD to boot from. <br /> <br />You say you can hear your hard drive spinning, but there is no operation from the DVD, and you are also getting a blank screen. First you should try <a rel="nofollow" href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1895'>resetting your iMac PRAM as described in this article</a>. Hopefully this should do it. <br /> <br />Also try <a rel="nofollow" href='http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=BootCamp/2.0/en/bc1144.html'>holding down the primary mouse button during the reboot</a>, this should eject the DVD and prove that DVD is getting power, and you can also verify that disc is not stuck in the drive. <br /> <br />If your DVD is not operational for some reason, you can also try attaching an external hard drive or a flash memory drive of sufficient capacity with OS X installation (you can use Disk Utility on another Mac to copy - restore the content of OS X install DVD onto a hard or flash drive) and try the installation from the external hard or flash drive (you choose it by holding the OPT key down during the reboot). <br /> <br />If none of the above is working, you could verify (with opening your iMac) that everything inside is connected as it should be and that you perhaps didn't miss attaching a cable in there. <br /> <br />Hopefully some of the above will work out for you. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi Richard, <br /> <br />I believe you are actually referring to the above posted comparison between 1.5 WD and Seagate drives. However situation with 2 TB WD and Seagate drives is a bit more different as their specifications are so closely matched making the comparison even more difficult. <br /> <br />Let's start with some technical details first that we'll translate later on to more understandable information (for those inpatient, just skip to the <strong>Conclusion section</strong>). <br /> <br /><img src='http://www.amfiteatar.org/images/2tb_comparison_header.png' /> <br /> <br /><strong>Power Consumption comparison 2 TB drives WD20EADS vs ST32000542AS</strong> <br /> <br />WD20EADS <br />- Readwrite power consumption: 6W <br />- Idle power consumption: 3.7W <br />- Standby: 0.8W <br /> <br />ST32000542AS <br />- Readwrite power consumption: 6.8W <br />- Idle power consumption: 5.5W <br />- Standby: 0.5W <br /> <br />Seagate uses 0.8W more power while working and 1.8W more power while idle, on the other hand WD uses 0.3W more power when in Standby. <br /> <br />Realistic estimation of the actual power consumption is really difficult to calculate as each user uses his computer (and hard drive) in a different way - do you keep your computer working all the time, do you shut it off at night or at times away, how much do you actually use it, how much data do you transfer with it... Another variable is also an average cost of electricity in your area. <br /> <br />Therefore, for the purpose of this comparison, we can only work out a theoretical model - and in this case let such theoretical value be the maximum (extreme) usage of your hard drive.  <br /> <br />Let's assume that hard drive will be operational 24/7/365 (which is absolutely not possible, but an extreme example), that would translate to 8760 hrs per year, meaning that WD would use 8760hrs x 6W = 52560wh = 52.56 Kwh of electricity/year , and Seagate would use 8760hrs x 6.8W = 59568wh = 59.57 Kwh/year. If we assume that average price of residential electricity is $0.12Kwh, that would translate to annual consumption of $6.30 for WD vs $7.14 for Seagate - difference being only $0.84 and for theoretical 24/7/365 full-time read/write operation. <br /> <br />Let's see how the same compares if the drives would be idle 24/7/365. I took the calculations on the side (won't trouble you with numbers here), it turns out that if WD was idle the whole year it would consume $3.89 worth of electricity vs $5.78 worth of electricity translating to difference of only $1.89  - again for theoretical assumptions the drives are idle 24/7/365. <br /> <br />The above realistically translates in a very insignificant financial difference in electricity consumption between the two drives. I trust it is safe to say that electricity consumption shouldn't be a purchasing factor for single/home usage in choosing between the two drives (unless you are a data center and have 1000s of hard drives in use).	</div>

	<strong>Read-write performance comparison 2 TB drives WD20EADS vs ST32000542AS</strong> <br /> <br />WD20EADS <br />- Sustained data transfer rate: 100 Mb/s <br /> <br />ST32000542AS <br />- Sustained data transfer rate: 95 Mb/s <br /> <br />How much are you going to miss 5 Mb/s really depends on how much you are using your computer and transferring large files. Let's work out a theoretical model of copying a file size of a DVD disc, typically 4.7 Gb. This again is a theoretical model and would mean copying from one hard drive to another, not from an actual DVD drive as optical drives are much slower (even 10 times) than hard drives. <br /> <br />4.7Gb equals to 4812 Mb. That would mean that you would be able to copy DVD movie from one 2TB WD drive to another 2TB WD drive in 49 seconds vs 52 seconds from 2TB Seagate to another 2TB Seagate drive - difference being 3 seconds per movie. Realistically you won't be able to achieve these transfer speeds as you would typically copy from your WD or Seagate drive to another, usually much slower media - and the speeds you would achieve would be of that slower media - hence both drives would most of the time achieve the same performance. <br /> <br />Therefore, although 2TB WD is a just a fraction faster drive than 2 TB Seagate, the actual speed difference you'd be able to notice is virtually non detectable for an average user. <br /> <br /><strong>Acoustics comparison 2 TB drives WD20EADS vs ST32000542AS</strong> <br /> <br />WD20EADS <br />- Idle Mode = 25 dBA (average) <br />- Seek Mode 0 = 29 dBA (average) <br />- Seek Mode 3 = 26 dBA (average) <br /> <br />ST32000542AS <br />- Idle Mode 1.9 bels (average) = 19 dBA <br />- Seek typical 2.0 bels = 20 dBA <br />Seek max 2.2 bels = 22 dBA <br /> <br />In this comparison Seagate does much better than WD in terms of acoustic performance. The difference in idle mode being 6 dB and in typical operation Seagate is 9 dB quieter than WD. The 9 dB sound compares to "calm breathing" - therefore for some sensitive ears Seagate might be a better choice. <br /> <br />Wikipedia's table on <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sound_pressure_and_sound_pre

	<strong>CONCLUSION of comparison between 2TB drives WD20EADS vs ST32000542AS</strong> <br /> <br />- <strong>Power consumption</strong> difference between 2TB Seagate and WD is approximated to only $1 per year in favor of WD <br />- <strong>Data transfer rate</strong> difference between 2TB Seagate and WD is virtually non detectable for an average user. <br />- <strong>Acoustic performance</strong> difference between 2TB Seagate and WD is compared to difference in "calm breathing" - which might be considerable for noise sensitive users. The acoustic performance goes in favor of Seagate being "calm breathing" quieter drive than WD <br /> <br />Therefore the performance between the latest 2 TB WD and Seagate drive is pretty close. For an average user you won't be able to notice any difference on your electricity bill or in terms of speed. However, in a very quiet room you would be able to notice that Seagate is acoustically quieter drive. Finally, another purchasing decision between the two drives has to be the price too - which you can check clicking at the following links - <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RB1TIS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B001RB1TIS'>current price for 2TB Western digital WD20EADS</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028Y4CY6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B0028Y4CY6'>current price for 2TB Seagate ST32000542AS</a>. <br /> <br />I hope the above analysis answers your question in as simple terms as possible. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hello Danny, <br /> <br />Here is my last sort of idea / question regarding which drive suits me the best and therefore which one I'll buy. <br /> <br />But first of all I was overwhelmed by your more than detailed reply...WOW, thanks for that. It was really understandable to me and maybe also for lots of other not so experienced people who are reading this. <br /> <br />But having read your reply, it makes me more than ever wonder if speed is not the major issue what makes one decide which HD to build in. Up till now I was thinking to get more storage room and because my iMac is on pretty much all the time, I was also concerned about it's power consumption. <br /> <br />But I saw in your comparison the sustained data transfer rates of the two drives: 100 Mb/s vs 95Mb/s. And earlier I read that the Seagate 7200.11. 1.5 TB has 120 Mb/s. <br /> <br />And with my rookie experience that seems to be a huge difference. And because of the fact that I also want to use Final Cut Studio on it, the Seagate seems to be the best option. And I have read it's also sort of green. But even if it's not, through your comparison I have noticed that the electricity bill is more or less to be neglected.  <br /> <br />So my last question before buying the "right disk for the job".  <br />Shall I notice a big difference between my earlier choice and latter? Now knowing that I also want to use FCS and having my iMac on during certainly during day &amp; night?   <br /> <br />You don't have to be as detailed as before, for I don't want to burden you to much. <br /> <br />And sorry for hesitating (lol) <br /> <br />Thanks again and keep up the good work. <br /> <br />Kind regards, <br />Richard <br />An admirer from Holland	</div>

	Hi Richard, <br /> <br />I wrote the above comparison between 2TB drives for everyone's benefit (this web page has lots of readers). <br /> <br />You are essentially asking now how to compare 1.5TB and 2.0 TB drives and what are the pros and cons between them. <br /> <br />The simple answer is as follows - if the storage space is what you need the most - you should consider having one of 2TB drives, and if speed is more important to you, go with 1.5 Seagate as additional 20Mb/s is a significant performance gain as compared with 2TB drives (100 Mb/s for 2TB drives vs 120Mb/s for 1.5 Seagate). <br /> <br />In my personal setup, I have 1.5TB Seagate inside of my iMac as I prefer the speed and a snappy response, especially when multitasking between a number of applications and copying files in the background back and forth. As far as the storage capacity goes, I use an external 4TB (2 x 2 TB) hard drive enclosure which takes care of storing those huge files. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi Danny, <br /> <br />Your answer is exactly what I got in mind when reading your first answer. And I have come to the conclusion that 1.5 TB is already a lot of storage. And I don't want to think in retrospect, that I better should have went for a slightly faster machine. For after all, that is something that's noticeable everytime I'm behind my Mac. And that's a lot!! <br /> <br />And extra storage can indeed easily be solved by connecting a external drive. So I'm totally convinced to go for the 1.5 Seagate although in my search till now I read somewhere that a 7400 RPM drive is probably too hot for a iMac or mainly too hot for it's heat sensor. But hearing that you have one build in yourself, makes me convinced that it works well. <br /> <br />Thank you, and in time I will let you know my findings after having it ordered, received (out of the States) and of course build in!!! <br /> <br />Best regards <br />Richard    	</div>

	Hi Danny, I made the upgrade with the 1,5 TB Seagate, and after some hours, the cpu fan went to 3500 rpm, just like Derek wrote some months ago. In the Hardware Test, it showed the problem code 4SNS/1/40000000:TLOP-70.187 <br />I know it is sensor related, but as the number of the code is slightly different from the one from Derek, I wonder if you know exactly what sensor is damaged.

	Branko, I wouldn't be worried about Time Machine hard drive being smaller in size than the internal hard drive. First of all NOT all files are being backed up to the time machine - (e.g. operating system files, etc.) - files being backed up are user files, user settings and applications - therefore you shouldn't assume that for 2tb of internal hard drive storage you need 2tb external time machine drive. Also, you can manually select (in System Preferences, Time Machine) certain files or folders you don't want your time machine to back up -- I use this for example to prevent the time machine from backing up my movie library - as these files are being huge and on the other hand it is not important for me to back them up. Therefore using a common sense logic and understanding of which large files or folders you don't need backing up, you can setup up this option and save some time machine space if you are really jammed up. Also, time machine automatically backs up the latest version of your user files and if it runs out of the space it deletes the oldest backups. Lastly, it is going to take you a really LONG time to fill up 2tb. <br /> <br />You might check out this <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/timemachine/'>official time machine guide (Apple support link)</a>. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Renato, I'm sorry to hear this. I've literally had hundreds of people reporting on successful hard drive upgrade following this guide, however cases like yours are very, very rare. Similar to Derek, you must have damaged one of the internal sensors during the upgrade. Unfortunately I don't know which sensor exactly is related to TLOP-70.187 error code (and I also could not find it on Google). I suppose you will have to take your machine to Apple for service. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Perhaps someone googling this post with a solution might be able to help out at some point in the future. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	<div class="comment-text" id="comment-text-container-400"> 
	Hi Richard, congratulations on your hard drive upgrade! <br /> <br />In terms of 6GB RAM, both iMac 2007 and iMac 2008 can be upgraded to 6GB due to the fact that they use the same chipset (Santa Rosa) used in Macs officially certified for 8GB. <br /> <br />This wasn't known at the time these machines came out as there were no 4GB memory sticks available at the time. Sure, you can install 2 x 4GB RAM in both slots, it will show up as 8GB, but it will NOT work, the system will freeze and crash - therefore 8GB in iMac 2007 and 2008 is highly UNSTABLE (this is just the way it is, the motherboard was not engineered with 8GB in mind for these models). <br /> <br />6GB is the unofficial maximum that can work well and be <strong>stable</strong> on both iMac 2007 and 2008 (including all unibody laptops certified originally for 4GB) - confirmed by actual users in several Mac community forums (if you google it there are lots of pages on it). <br /> <br />As far as which memory to install, it is interesting to note that you will often hear selling pitches such as "Apple memory" or "OWC memory for Macs" - the best kept secret in the Mac world is that these are only selling strategies, as you can use memory from ANY manufacturer that complies with your computer's technical specifications (even "PC branded" memory). <br /> <br />For example, Apple doesn't make its own memory - sometimes in Macs you will see Hynix or other memory modules installed by Apple. OWC memory is nothing but a label on a memory stick with Samsung (or other) chips (and there are only a few memory chip manufacturers in the world). Then when you compare the price tag between "Apple certified" memory and memory sold for PC laptops with the exact same technical specifications (btw. "PC branded" memory works great in Macs too), the price difference is quite radical! They use the same memory chips, so what is the extra cost for? - it is the tax on perception of a brand value and a quality. <br /> <br />Personally, I would use parameters such are warranty (many quality memory manufacturers offer lifetime warranties) and return policies in choosing memory for my Mac (regardless if the memory is Mac or PC laptop branded - chip wise its all the same). <br /> <br />Having said the above, you can upgrade <strong>iMac 2007</strong> to <strong>6GB RAM</strong> with one "<a rel="nofollow" href='http://bit.ly/AMAzk'>2GB 667Mhz unbuffered so-dimm</a>" and one "<a rel="nofollow" href='http://bit.ly/eZicb'>4GB 667Mhz unbuffered so-dimm</a>" memory stick from any manufacturer (even if it is sold as a PC memory) complying to PC2-5300 specification. <br /> <br />Similarly, <strong>iMac 2008</strong> can be upgraded to <strong>6GB RAM</strong> with one "<a rel="nofollow" href='http://bit.ly/o6r5F'>2GB 800Mhz unbuffered so-dimm</a>" and one "<a rel="nofollow" href='http://bit.ly/19koQ8'>4GB 800Mhz unbuffered so-dimm</a>" memory module from any manufacturer (PC branded memory too) complying to PC2-6400 specification. <br /> <br />I have updated the above article memory upgrade section to reflect this accordingly. You can also reference <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amfiteatar.org/content/view/155/57/lang,en/#ramupgradeoptions'>iMac RAM memory upgrade table</a> to determine RAM upgrade options in your case. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Danny, <br /> <br />Thanks for the answer. <br />I have the Leopard Snow installed which should presumably support 8GB. <br />Now, if one 4GB module can be installed, wouldn&#8217;t it be possible to install two of them? <br /> <br />Regarding the upgrade to 1.5 TB drive, I have done it and it went smoothly but with a small modification: <br /> <br />Rather than disconnecting the 2 display connectors at the bottom of the of the display,  which I found difficult to locate in my iMac 24, I brought the iMac back to vertical position. <br />I then pulled the upper part of the display away from the mother board, while holding its lower part tight, thus creating an opening (like a V) in which I could push my hand and release the 3rd display connector from the display itself (hidden by a black tape that has to be removed first) rather then from the small blue board. No unscrewing was required. <br /> <br />While standing, I then leaned the display on my belly so it stays stable and with two hands comfortably released and replaced the drive as described in your instructions. <br />Once replaced, I reconnected the connector and pushed back the display to its position. <br />Thanks for the great instructions you drafted in your blog. <br />Eli <br />	</div>

	Hi Eli, thank you for sharing your experience with us - your approach to iMac hard drive upgrade standing up is certainly not for everyone or faint-hearted <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> In terms of 8GB on iMac 2007 and 2008 - I don't think Snow Leopard will make any difference - it won't work - you can upgrade these models to max 6GB and that's 2GB above original manufacturer's specification. Unless you are doing some really heavy pro stuff it is very, very hard to use up 8GB of RAM at any single point - even if you run two virtual machines (e.g. Windows and a Linux) in the background. <br /> <br />David - I haven't got the time to post up the GPU and other upgrades and I didn't think of it as a priority as there is lack of genuine Apple parts (iMac MXM GPU cards) on the market and they are so highly priced making the project financially nonviable in my opinion. While hard drive or RAM DIY upgrades make lots of sense (financially), not all upgrades are cost effective. I was also thinking of an alternative cost-effective solution - taking a non-Apple graphics card (e.g. high end ATI or NVidia) and trying to run it on an iMac - but such solution would require appropriate graphics kexts developed (in PC terms "video card drivers") and installed on the system - due to which there could be problems booting the machine on clean reinstall or loosing the capability once you upgrade the OS - that is unless a third party graphics card can be flashed and reprogrammed to bare a hardware ID of a genuine Apple graphics card... you can see where I'm getting with this - lots of time in development would be required in order to make the graphics upgrade financially viable at this time. Not to discourage you, but at this point you'd probably be better off selling your existing machine and paying the difference for a brand new model rather than paying for an iMac GPU upgrade. <br /> <br />In terms of the DVD upgrade - you already have one of the "fastest" DVD-RW models available - the optical drive guide could really serve only as a repair guide. Perhaps a blue-ray upgrade would be worth it - I'd need to look into it. <br /> <br />Finally, if some of you guys have free time on your hands and want to help out in any of these projects - this is purely voluntary to have fun and also to give something back to the community - give me a shout. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

For a rehearsal, I just finished dis-assembling and re-assembling the imac 2007 based on your instructions! They were very useful and clearly laid out. <br /> <br /> I think I made a mistake.  <br /> <br />On the back of the LCD panel, there are two connectors, Blue/Gray and Pink/Gray. Before realizing to mark them, I disconnected both these. After that, I did not have a choice but to make a "educated" guess on connecting them back. I have assembled the imac and booted. Every things seems to be working fine. I tested the camera, DVD player and they seem to be working fine! <br /> <br />I do not know, if I REALLY got lucky! What happens if the polarities for these connectors are reversed or incorrectly connected?  <br /> <br />Any way to identify and connect them properly? <br /> <br />Thanks  <br />Mahesh 	</div>

	Mahesh, <br /> <br />If you reverse polarities of connectors, things can go really bad - especially if this is a power lead... having said that Apple usually designs connectors to be of different shapes  sizes, and also each connector has a tab preventing it to be wrongly inserted where it's not supposed to go. Just observe connector sizes and tabs carefully, and don't force anything in -- if it's not easy to plug in and if you need to force it in - it usually means it's not meant to go there. <br /> <br />Good luck upgrading! <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	I discovered that my display had 6 separate cables, two which were connected to the motherboard below the display, as pictured in your excellent article, and 4 which were connected to the right hand side of the monitor and which were all small connectors.  Having unconnected only the first two cables, I was able to lay the iMac on its back and stand the monitor up with the right edge sitting on the table and held from falling by a 3rd and 4th hand, leaving the latter 4 connectors still connected.  Now I was able to quickly swap the HD out, forgetting the ESD item,  oops.  I don't know if I'd have done it just for an upgrade knowing how difficult it was (over 50 and eyes are getting worse) but your instructions pulled me through.  <br />Thanks.  May I suggest adding a better close-up of the two connectors below the display.  The cable to the connector near the fan went under the fan and was kind of stuck there.  Since the wire went from a net-shrouded cable to separate wires while it was UNDER the fan I couldn't tell what connector I was unplugging.  After I started removing the display I was able to wiggle the wire loose enough to identify which connector it was.  	</div>

	Thank you very much for your very clear and helpful website. I wouldn't and couldn't have done the upgrade of my iMac without it. <br />I have replaced the original WD3200AAJS (320GB) drive of my late 2007 iMac with a Hitachi Deskstar 7K2000, which is a 7200rpm, 32MB cache 2TB drive. <br />In terms of speed the drive performs quit well, it is noticeably faster than the Western Digital drive it replaced. The drive does become a little more more: 51C/124F than the original drive. The hard drive fan turns at 1200 rpm, which I believe is no more than originally. <br />A little disappointing though is the seek noises the disk makes! On idle, the drive cannot be heard, but when in use, the seek noises are clearly audible. The original drive was near quiet ! <br />This drive is retailed in the Netherlands at this moment for approx. &#8364;150,-  which at the current exchange rate is approx. $225 US. <br />Overall i think the replacement was ok. The seek noises of the drive, I still need to get used to. (is still less noise compared to what my MyBook Studio drives produce, that sit next to my iMac). But due to the fact that I now have 2 TB of storage available, one of those drives can be put to use elsewhere. <br /> <br />The replacement itself. I used one large suction cup, that is normally used to keep my TomTom navigation system to the windscreen. Just put that in the centre of the screen and you can lift the glass easily from the front panel.  I didn't remove the display. I only disconnected the two leads at the rear of the screen in the top right corner. When the screws that retain the lcd panel have been removed, the panel can easily be lifted from the top  and kept in that position, by putting a stick underneath it (like when you open the bonnet of a car). Also the iSight connectors do not have to be removed, when you "flip"  the front panel on the desk. <br />	</div>

	Thanks very much for taking the time to put this on the Net.  I am a computer tech, and I was a little nervous at first, wondering if I would end up with nothing but a large box of broken iMac compenents.  Regardless, I followed your instructions, and it was very easy.  Much easier to do then you would believe.  In my case the hard disk was dead, so I needed to replace it.  I replaced it with a Seagate 750G.  Worked flawlessly.  I found the suction cups in the Christmas section of a local store.    The only thing I would add is; put the suction on all 4 corners of the screen, as there are magnets all around the plexiglass screen.  Your puctures almost make it look like you are going to hinge or fold the screen down at an angle, which is what I did.  In turn I bent one of the alignment pins at the bottom.  Yes, there are pins all around the screen to line it up.  Looking back the only thing I would have done differently is; use two people to remove the screen and lift evenly from the main chasis.  Everything was smooth as can be.  Thanks!	</div>

	I have just completed my hard drive changeout, following the comprehensive guidelines provided.  They worked great.  I have a fall 2007 iMac and had the same experience as Chuck / Nov 23, 2009.  I had the 8 screws (4 each side) to hold the LCD in place, plus the 2nd set of connectors.  Since I had a large enough work space, I was able to flip (rotate gently!) the frame over and did not disconnect the camera.   <br /> <br />I was extremely surprised at the lightness of the glass panel.  I had purchased 2 industrial suction cups at a local hardware supply.  I most likely could have used some kitchen / bathroom suction cups as Danny used.  They most likely are the most economical solution as you just need some stead pressure to break the first magnet hold and then you could just lift the panel.  It reinstalled very easy. <br /> <br />I had a little trouble getting the aluminum frame off first.  It seemed to hang on the bottom part, but was able to gently work it around and get it lifted.  I bought a Seagate 1.5 TB raptor drive.  I had already upgraded from 2 to 4 GB RAM before I read the posting on the 6 GB option.  Previous research indicated a 4 GB max.  the 2x2GB SIMMS seem to be the most economical upgrade at the time.  My original HD totally crashed (WD 500GB).  Not sure why.  I restored the setup from Time Machine and the iMac really zips along with the Seagate. <br /> <br />Only part I didn't install was some little cushion / shock absorber.  I didn't want to take the computer back apart again just for that and have not noticed any unusual vibration (yet). <br /> <br />Again - great guideline.	</div>

However a year later this actually might be affordable now. <br /> <br />The short answer to your question is - yes, it will work. <br /> <br />However, I'm not sure that JBOD configuration - although with an SSD drive will be significantly faster than with a single "classical" hard drive, however I bet that using 2pcs x <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R4BBLU?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001R4BBLU&amp;adid=0GDSVJ35DSMZ7BB6ZMCR&amp;'>2.5 inch 500Gb Seagate Momentus</a> hard drives in a true RAID configuration will give your iMac an amazing speed kick. <br /> <br />Now the long explanation for everyone's benefit: <br /> <br />iMac does provide only one SATA port for a single hard drive, however this enclosure has an internal RAID controller providing two SATA connections internally for two hard drives inside the enclosure. <br /> <br />Utilizing <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FZJ1K8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B002FZJ1K8&amp;adid=1VV81C7WE7SPTBTN8W44&amp;'>Patriot Convoy XL 2-Bay SSD SATA External RAID Enclosure</a> will allow you to use two 2.5 inch hard drives (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R4BBLU?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001R4BBLU&amp;adid=0GDSVJ35DSMZ7BB6ZMCR&amp;'>500Gb Seagate Momentus 2.5in</a>) in a <a rel="nofollow" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID'>RAID</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.accs.com/p_and_p/RAID/BasicRAID.html'>JBOD</a> configuration. The enclosure has a built in internal RAID controller and it utilizes only <strong>one</strong> external SATA port. In other words, this 3.5 inch enclosure has the same SATA power and data connectors as on a single 3.5" hard drive used in iMacs, however its internal electronics is providing two ports allowing connection of two smaller 2.5 inch drives in a RAID configuration (data being written to two drives in parallel, theoretically almost doubling speed performance). <br /> <br />Please let us know how did this work out for you and some benchmarks - speed results? <br /> <br />Good luck <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	I would be able to provide you with a better answer if you should explain a purpose of your proposed modification. I have assumed you want to have a significant data throughput performance increase - as such my answers are tailored in that direction. <br /> <br />Answering your question: <br /> <br />- 1ssd and 1hdd in jbod - Yes, will work in iMac using the patriot convoy xl <br />- no, you will not be able to see them as two separate drives as by definition jbod puts the capacity of two drives together and you see it all as one big drive (hence the question of the purpose of the proposed modification?). <br />- I don't think it is possible to see both drives separately in any way, at least not installing it internally - that is unless you want to give up your DVDRW drive and use its SATA connection for the second drive (will work only on the latest i7 iMacs as their superdrives use SATA connectors, unlike the previous PATA interfaces - e.g. similar to installing two drives in the latest Mac Minis by giving up the DVDRW drive). <br /> <br />Usefulness of the RAID setup: <br /> <br />- In my opinion, the usefulness of this setup is to gain a dramatic speed performance by hooking up two drives of the same capacity and configuring a true RAID with this enclosure within the iMac. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Thanks Danny for the detailed instruction and I did changed with a new 1.5TB Seagate one, as I reported earlier in the post.  I have experiencing with fan noise problems, and the case is similar to the post of Derek's.  When I changed the original 500GB back, everything is fine.  It is quite strange and I swapped them over several times, the same results happened.  <br />Another strange things is that when I installed the iStat Pro on both the disks, there is no display about the temperature and fan speed.  It seems that the sensors are not working.  The program works well on my MacBook Pro and Makbook 13inch, all of the three machins are working with Snow leopard.  The new iMac comes with Max OSX 10.6.1, and the notebooks are with the first release of 10.6. Is it the reason for the bad display of information? <br />Thanks a lot for the help <br />Dingyu   	</div>

	Hi Peter, <br /> <br />There are three things you can look into in order to take an advantage of SSD drive performance: <br /> <br />1) you can install an SSD internally and have an external fw800 hard drive for the storage <br /> <br />2) alternative is, as you said, to use 2 SSD's in RAID 0 configuration using the Patriot Convoy XL 2-Bay enclosure - being the best and the fastest solution you can have internally to give your iMac a kick in speed.  <br /> <br />I also believe that by installing two 500gb Seagate Momentus drives with this enclosure can provide performance increase, for much less money than purchasing two ssds (still being expensive compared to classical magnetic hard drives) - this perhaps would be the most cost effective solution. <br /> <br />In order to compare this, if you use Seagate 1.5TB 3.5in internal hard drive in your iMac (let's say a standard single drive installation), you can get max 125mbps sustained data rate (I'm reading this off the spec sheet). The Seagate Momentus 500gb 2.5in hard drive has 76mbs sustained data rate (again from the spec sheet), therefore if you use two in the RAID 0 mode you will get the theoretical maximum of 152 mps. <br /> <br />In terms of SSD's, let's look at the Patriot SSD hard drives, SSD v2 having 100mbps write and 175mbps read performance, and SSD v3 having 160mps write and 240mbps read performance. Theoretically you can double this in RAID 0 by using the enclosure in question, therefore with SSD v2 get 200mps write and 300mps read performance (not 350mbps as the SATA interface is limited to 300mps), and with SSD v3 get both read and write at 300mps (hence a full utilization of the SATA interface capacity). <br /> <br />3) however, the way you envisioned it - booting of an SSD drive and installing a second drive internally for storage (and seeing them as separate drives) cannot quite work as there are no two SATA ports inside. Using the Patriot enclosure in JBOD mode will not provide you with this functionality. <br /> <br />JBOD stands for "Just a Bunch Of Disks". It's where you use multiple physical hard drives to create one large logical drive. It's not really RAID, but is similar to RAID 0 except the drives are spanned instead of stripped, meaning files fill up the first drive completely, then the second - drives get filled up as each runs out - hence you will not have any performance increase with JBOD. With JBOD you can use hard drives of different sizes and for RAID 0 your two hard drives must be of the same size (capacity). You would need to go to RAID 0 configuration to get the performance increase (hence either using two SSDs or to Seagate Momentus drives of the same capacity). <br /> <br />Perhaps there is a solution on the market that provides port replication of a single to two SATA ports which you would need to research. <br /> <br />Hope the above helps. <br /> <br />Danny <br />	</div>

	Hi Dingyu, <br /> <br />It seems from the earlier post that you have installed a larger hard drive in i5 / i7 iMac (the 21.5 or 27 inch iMac) and that you are having fan speed problems. <br /> <br />While in Derek's case he damaged a temperature sensor in an earlier generation iMac, the problem with the <strong>latest i5 / i7 iMacs</strong> is that Apple has started using the internal hard drive sensors for temperature monitoring - thefore limiting the types of drives that can be installed in the machine! Sorry to say this but Seagate hard drives are now no longer compatible with iMac i5 / i7. You have also experienced this by moving the old hard drive back in and getting the fans quiet. Apple uses Western Digital hard drives, therefore <strong>in order to upgrade the latest i5 / i7 iMac to a larger hard drive, the instructions found here can be used, however you can only use Western Digital hard drives in order to make this work</strong> - as Apple is using internal temperature sensors in the hard drive in order to determine the cooling fan speed. This all has to do with the software, perhaps sometimes in the future Apple will allow Seagate hard drives in iMac, however for the time being iMac i5 / i7 users are out of luck and will need to upgrade with Western Digital hard drives only. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Hi Peter, <br /> <br />You're welcome. The post was also for everyone's benefit. <br /> <br />If you should upgrade the RAM or not depends really on what do you use your iMac for. The same goes in terms of the decision of having an internal RAID 0 installed - what do you need all of that speed for? If you are doing lots of video editing, I can understand the need, but for an average user this might be an overkill. <br /> <br />Everyone's computer usage  application is different, that is why you need to measure what you do with your machine in order to determine if you need more RAM, a faster hard drive, etc. What I would recommend to do is to install a really great utility called <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatmenus/'>iStats Menus</a> that will allow you to measure your RAM memory utilization, hard drive performance (mpbs for read and write) and a bunch of other things (CPU utilization, network throughput, temperature sensors, etc)... Therefore by using this utility you will be able to make the conclusion if you need more RAM, faster hard drive (e.g. RAID 0), etc. <br /> <br />Good luck, <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	Patrick, <br /> <br />It's really hard to tell what might be wrong without some concrete diagnostic information. Does the drive spin up? You should be able to hear it powering up. When you boot off the OS X installation DVD and go into Disk Utility (from the main menu), does the drive show up? I would assume that the drive is connected properly inside (two connectors - power and data). If nothing from the above works, perhaps it's a dead drive and you would need to verify that (e.g. if you have an external enclosure or a PC to try it with)... <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

	To Danny &amp; all contributors, <br /> <br />Again Thank you for this great thread!!! After buying a new WD-Black 1TB HDD my iMac still would not recognize it, even though it is getting power and all that. So I took my External HDD case apart and started to plug in the HDD's to see if any of them are read-able through my MBP... Funny thing is my original Internal HDD would be detected but not the new HDD replacement. So I went back to Best buy and got a Seagate Baracuda 1TB HDD and surprise surprise!!! Its working! and is more silent than the WD-Black 1TB and cheaper as well by 20.00... So all in all instead of bringing my iMac back to Apple and costing me 3 figures I ended up spending a total of only 90.00 for the HDD   Torx set   Suction cups. Amazing. <br /> <br />One thing I will always remember from now on though is to ALWAYS run Time Machine!!! Cause by negating to do so I lost all my audio, pictures, movies, and some documents that aren't really critical but I was keeping for record. <br /> <br />Anyhow, my case is closed! I now have a Seagate 1TB baracuda 32mb cache 7200rpm drive in my 24"-AL 3.06GHz w/ 6GB 800mhz RAM. All thanks to each and everyone of you in this board and Special Thanks to Danny for all your input. <br /> <br />I am looking forward for your future GPU &amp; CPU upgrade guide So I can beef up this 3.06 and perhaps upgrade my GeForce 8800 GT to something more meaty in the future. <br /> <br />*HAPPY HOLLIDAYS!* <br /> <br />Extremely Thankful Reader <br />Patrick <br />Raynham, MA	</div>

	Kashif, the "?" icon indicates that the system cannot find your OS or the hard drive. I would assume that your system worked fine the night before you've got the ? icon at the startup. Insert the OS X install DVD. If you hold the option key after the startup chime sound, do you see the hard drive icon? If not, the hard drive is most likely dead. If yes, select to boot from the OS X DVD and when you get to the first prompt, select Disk Utility from the main menu. Does the hard drive show up in there? Try running the disk repair, and try rebooting. Perhaps this should fix the file system if it got corrupted. With the above steps you should be able to figure out if there is a data corruption on your hard drive (steps to fix - repair hard drive from the Disk Utility, or even reinstall OS X if that doesn't work), or if the hard drive does not show up at all, that would mean it crashed and you would need to replace it. <br /> <br />Good luck, <br /> <br />Danny <br /> <br />~~~ Happy Holidays everyone ~~~	</div>

	Hi Andrew, <br /> <br />We've had a case like this somewhere above in the comments - it is either the drive itself in which case you have to look into recommended quieter drives (either WD Green or Seagate 1.5 or 2.0TB - I wouldn't have information for lower capacity drives such is yours), or there has been an installation issue with the hard drive mounts - if you believe this is the case you need to go back in and check that the metal pins are properly in place on the hard drive and inserted into the rubber mounts - essentially these are acting as shocksound absorbers. <br /> <br />Danny <br /> <br />~~~ Happy New Year 2010 to everyone ~~~ <br />	</div>

	My 1TB time capsule just died after 18 months.  As far as I can tell from web searches it is a power problem and the hard disk is still ok.  Is the hard disk from the time capsule interchangeable with my 2007 20" imac.  I am thinking that if the disk is still good I could give my imac an upgrade.  If it is possible would you consider the disk to be good enough or would i be better using the disk externally and getting a new disk for the imac? <br /> <br />thanks. 	</div>

	Mat, if your hard drive from Time Capsule works, you can install it in your iMac 2007 (late) aluminum. The hard drive used in Time Capsule has SATA interface being used in all aluminum iMacs (it is not compatible with older iMac white models). If it is only 1.5 years old, it should still be a good hard drive as the original manufacturer warranties are anywhere from 3-5 years - depending on a brand. You can test if the hard drive works using an external enclosure. All the best, Danny	</div>

	Hey guys, I will soon be getting a new imac 27" with i5 processor! So, I currently have 2 SSD's here with me already (30gb each), that I plan on putting in raid 0 with the patriot enclosure. I am planning to have these SSDs take the place of the DVD player on the imac. Although, how will I install the OS on it w/o being able to put a CD in it? Would it be possible to bring the original hard drive onto my PC, as a 'slave' and the SSD's as well and simply copy the original hard drive to my SSD setup? I would think so, but there can always be complications and maybe some registration issues with CD-keys ect ect... <br /> <br />Input would be great! <br /> <br />Thanks in advance. <br /> <br />ALB	</div>

	Hi Alex, <br /> <br />That should be possible if you want to give up the DVD drive, it would be an interesting mod, and if you proceed with it it would be interesting to see the benchmarks before and after the mod (e.g. you can use <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.xbench.com/'>Xbench software</a>). I should also point out that by doing this mod you will lose the warranty, most of the users prefer doing the upgrades after their warranty has expired. <br /> <br />In terms of the OS installation, you can boot off an USB memory stick of a sufficient capacity (e.g. 8GB and up) -- you need to use the Disk Utility to copy the image from the install DVD onto the USB stick and you can install the system. Unlike Windows, there are no "cd keys" for OS X, you just install it and it works (welcome to Mac). Alternatively there are several HDD clone software packages for Mac that could be used as well to copy the image off the OS. <br /> <br />Danny	</div>

The space is about 3-4 inches, and was enough for me to remove the HD screws and bracket. <br />Then I popped off the HD connectors and took the HD took the HD out. <br /> <br />As I'm always a little hesitant with connectors I decided to give it a try and it worked great. <br /> <br />I guess it's up to personal preference. <br />	</div>

	Also, I purchased 4GB memory upgrades from OWC for both computers last year giving them the model numbers and relying on them to supply the correct memory. Using the About This Mac instructions above, I checked the newly installed memory in my MBP. Calls for 800Mhz....They sent me 667Mhz. The Imac calls for 800Mhz, but I assume they sent me 667Mhz since it was ordered at the same time. I still have to check the Imac to see what's actually installed. <br />After reading above, I'd like to upgrade to 6GB memory in both. I'll need one 2GB module   one 4GB module but when I use your link to the 4GB module, it takes me to 4GB memory (2x2GB), not a single 4GB module. <br />OWC offers 4 2gb memory, but was wondering if you knew of another supplier? <br />Some say mixing 4 2 will slow the memory down. Is there any truth to this? <br />Thanks in advance for your reply. <br />Joe	</div>

	Hi Joe, <br /> <br />Thanks for sharing your experience with us! <img style="valign:absolute-middle;"src='http://www.amfiteatar.org//components/com_jomcomment/smilies/smiley.gif' border='0' alt='smilies/smiley.gif' /> <br /> <br />What you might want to do is to manually partition the new hard drive with FAT32 (Windows) and HFS (Mac) partition and to use <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SRNS7A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B002SRNS7A'>Norton Ghost Image</a> to clone the Windows partition and <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/13803/superduper%21'>Super Duper</a> to clone the Mac partition. <br /> <br />Personally, I do not like hard drive cloning utilities, there is a number of things that could go wrong and the amount of time to make everything work properly might be staggering. For example, making a ghost image of Win XP, Vista or Win 7 will require re-activation (as an anti-piracy measure) as the OS will detect the hard drive has been changed(?) <br /> <br />What you might consider doing is performing a clean OS X install, then using <a rel="nofollow" href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3322'>Migration Assistant</a> (Applications / Utilities) to move data from the old to the new hard drive (e.g. you can connect your old hard drive through an external USB enclosure). This will move your data AND software, music, plugins, everything -- practically there is no need to clone the Mac partition as Apple made this wonderful utility in the OS X that copies everything from your old Mac hard drive! And might I say perhaps reinstalling the OS X after a while as compared to hard drive cloning might get rid of a number of junk files that have accumulated throughout the years. <br /> <br />In terms of running Windows on a Mac - do you really need it on a separate partition? How often do you actually use Windows? If you do not have a need for a dedicated Windows machine you might consider running it from within OS X in a virtual machine, and this eliminates the need to have two partitions on a hard drive -- a single Mac partition will be all you need! <br /> <br />I personally use Windows applications through <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Q72JB8?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B002Q72JB8&amp;adid=1NNV9JW9RCK7WZTZTDFP&amp;'>VmWare Fusion 3</a> virtual machine (another good virtual machine software is <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002X7F2Y2?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B002X7F2Y2&amp;adid=17FMG3V32EGWZXR9KXYE&amp;'>Parallels Desktop 5</a>) that makes Windows run simultaneously inside my OS X. VmWare, as well as Parallels can copy your Windows XP partition into a virtual machine file (e.g. if you copy it from your old hard drive connected externally in an <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1NAMO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B000P1NAMO'>USB hard drive enclosure</a>). <br /> <br />In terms of your experience purchasing the memory from OWC please note that mixing memory speeds is not recommended. Installing 667Mhz memory in an 800Mhz capable machine will slow it down. <br /> <br />In terms of the RAM memory upgrade of your iMac to 6 GB, I have updated the links above. You will need one <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018S3XZC?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B0018S3XZC&amp;adid=0MNW3H1KVKJQRQ1YW1XH&amp;'>2GB 800Mhz SODIMM</a> memory module and one <a rel="nofollow" href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DEYYCW?tag=amfitedirectf-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=B001DEYYCW&amp;adid=19HTM8XK5ZEK4XR5HXMT&amp;'>4GB 800Mhz SODIMM</a> memory module to make the 6GB upgrade. <br /> <br />I hope the above helps! Good luck with your data migration and with the RAM memory upgrade! <br /> <br />Danny	</div>
