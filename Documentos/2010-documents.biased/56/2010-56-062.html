This is going to be a long term project of scanning slides, color correcting, and saving. It will be used 8 hours a day for a year or two fo this project.<br />
<br />
My question is this. What is the best computer for the job. A Mac G4, a PC?, a dual processor PC? If PC, than what OS? If dual, what processor (XP, MP, Duron)?<br />
<br />
I really need informed opinions here. What is the best platform for Adobe Photohop?</div></div><hr />

I run everything under the sun plus alot of adobe stuff, so i went PC.  But buy for a specific use and your choices become very easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm not mistaken, I believe Adobe Photoshop is multi-threaded, so a dual Athlon XP system should run niiiiice. :)</div></div><hr />

1mg cache if im not mistaken.<br />
<br />
i dont know if you can get a dual system, but that would be the fastest around for photoshop.&lt;--g4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jasonlylevene</div><div class="date">05-04-02, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yeah, MAC owned that industry for years, but....<br />
<br />
Cost/performance still doesn't favor the MAC. It's excellent hardware, no doubt, and given your specific intent, a good choice if price isn't such an issue.<br />
<br />
However, while Photoshop is threaded, it's limited to the extent that it doesn't achieve double the performance. SMP will give you much smoother response if you're opening multiple applications, and I THINK it helps if you have multiple images.<br />
<br />
On the PC side, the high memory bandwidth of PC800 RAM (or the newer stuff, whatever they call that 533Mhz version) coupled with the higher speed AGP performance of most of the Intel based boards tends to favor the recent P4 CPU's for Photoshop and similar applications.<br />
<br />
I'm an AMD fan, myself, but then I'm also more interested in 3D rendering performance than pure Photoshop performance, so I'd have to say that a high end AMD would be a price conscious solution, but a fair one.</div></div><hr />

They're very good at what they're made to do, and that's graphics.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, they use a different color standard than PCs which is superior in the context of graphic arts.  If you've got a big enough wallet, definately go with the Mac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">el</div><div class="date">05-05-02, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much do the high end macs cost?  I would overclock a 1.8A to 2.4 before spending more than 3000 on a mac.  Maybe you could test out you filters at an apple store and upload the filter here and have someone with dual machine/1.8@2.4 and see who wins.  Science is the best way to test.</div></div><hr />

My mom works at the apple store and i've been there to play with the high ends macs, they are nice, but you can get more out of a PC. Try a dual Xeon p4 or a Dual P3 with 2mb cache. Either one will prob crush a mac. :)</div></div><hr />

I jsut racked up a total of over $14,000 on the highest end mac :). take a look. they top out at 256 cache i think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jasonlylevene</div><div class="date">05-05-02, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's an interesting review. While it's not exactly Photoshop, the performance bottlenecks are similar for Adobe After Effects, as reviewed here:<br />
<br />
http://www.digitalvideoediting.com/cgi-bin/getframeletter.cgi?%2F2002%2F05_may%2Ffeatures%2Fc w_aeshowdown.htm<br />
<br />
They compare a MAC with dual processors against a typical dual MP1800. The dual MP1800 is usually about 30% ahead of the MAC on all benchmarks.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, they use a different color standard than PCs which is superior in the context of graphic arts.<br />
<br />
Pardon my questioning this point, but I'm not sure I buy this claim. I acknowledge that the first Pantone matched monitors were probably made for the MAC, but color is generated by math using the primary light sources of red, green and blue. I don't think any MAC has more than 32bit color, like most current PC cards, and many monitors are interchangeable between the platforms.<br />
<br />
Color, with respect to Photoshop, is a function of the software. Depending on the color model you choose, you might be referencing ink pigments in cyan, magenta and yellow, or one of the many other color models available. These models can be accurately converted from one to the other with simple math, only a little more complicated than a conversion from miles to kilometers. <br />
<br />
I think what you noticed was the color selector options in Photoshop on the MAC (or some other software), which are identicle in the PC, but may have been set to one of the other standards when you used it. Depending on the output target, various models can be a superior choice, but it's not MAC specific, to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
I'd REALLY like to know if I'm wrong about this, as I'm and engineer and I've written plugins for 3DSMax, Maya and others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you should check out that link, because IT CAN'T!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want you to loose your computer over it ;)<br />
<br />
They were surprised, too.<br />
<br />
And here's another interesting study:<br />
<br />
http://www.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=question299.htm&amp;url=http://www.barefeats.com/pentium.html<br />
<br />
It clearly shows that the Athlon 1.4Ghz processor (Athlon XP1600+ single CPU) is almost as fast at Photoshop 6.0 (20 operations tested) than a dual G4/1000!<br />
<br />
Ouch!<br />
<br />
<br />
In the review, the analyst says this:<br />
<br />
Which is the fastest? It depends what you are running. Is megahertz immaterial? It would seem so. When a 1400MHz Athlon runs as fast or faster than a G4 &quot;2000&quot; and faster than an 1800MHz Pentium you have to look elsewhere for answers.<br />
....<br />
After seeing how fast the Athlons go, I'm now wishing I had built a &quot;Killer&quot; Athlon 2000+ system instead of a &quot;killer&quot; Pentium 4 system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ice_Gargoylle</div><div class="date">05-05-02, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">siply based on those benches, it seems the g4 runs better as a single cpu.  The benches go into quake and rendering, but thats not the specified use here.  As for the first link, i would of loved to see a single g4 run those benches.  Seeing the second links results, i think it would be different.<br />
<br />
Dont take all this the wrong way now, i would never buy a mac, im just tryng to point out that for the specific use of photoshop, the g4 will be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jasonlylevene</div><div class="date">05-05-02, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont take all this the wrong way now, i would never buy a mac, im just tryng to point out that for the specific use of photoshop, the g4 will be better. <br />
<br />
But how could it be better.<br />
<br />
Did you miss the G4/933, a single CPU test in Photoshop?<br />
<br />
http://www.barefeats.com/images/p4-foto.gif <br />
<br />
The last line IS a single CPU G4, only 67Mhz behind a single 1000.<br />
<br />
It's over 40% slower than an AthlonXP 1600+<br />
<br />
<br />
What about the G4 makes it better, if it's slower, or if it costs 3x more than a &quot;self-built&quot; PC in order to match speed?<br />
<br />
Now, the Mac OS, maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ice_Gargoylle</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you are correct, i didnt see the way the chart was set up..my fualt.<br />
<br />
does any1 know if those g4's have the 1 mg cache?<br />
<br />
i chkd pricewatch and it seems they only sell up to 500mhz with the 1 mg cache.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt go for those cpu's anyday...gettn blazed by a athalon, a damn disgrace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jasonlylevene</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Ice_Gargoylle; I sincerely hope you didn't think I was poking at you.  Since the Mac's were introduced into this thread I've been amazed at the impression people have of them, and it seems, if you look back over the thread with the test results in mind, that I'm swimming upstream. <br />
<br />
I know there's an audiance, besides (and including) cmcquisition, that are attempting to decide how to spend money wisely, and I do love a good, healthy debate ;).<br />
<br />
I didn't get the detail on the 800 and the 933, but the 1000 had the 1Meg cache. Even if the 933 was the 512, though, it wouldn't have caught up that much.<br />
<br />
The best price on the G4 500Mhz chip with 1Mbyte Cache was $373. There is precious little I can find on the chip now, but I recall reading the technical breifs some time ago. On paper it looks like an awesome chip, but in practice it just doesn't do more than Intel and AMD can manage, anymore. Motorola, even with IBM's partnership, just isn't as focused on bleeding edge processor performance as AMD and Intel. If they clocked the chip at 2.0Ghz, though, it would be an entirely different matter. <br />
<br />
Anyone know of an overclocked G4?<br />
<br />
An interesting point, too - if you calculate the ratio of the Athlon speed (1400 Mhz) to the single G4 (933Mhz), then multiply by the Athlon's score (48), you get 72.03. This suggests that the G4 933 is, tick for tick, almost exactly even with the AthlonXP's IPC, as judged by the Photoshop test.<br />
<br />
In the end, though, Photoshop executes the same algorithms, and the same user interface on both machines, with identicle visual results and output. However, with the $3000 one G4 machine would cost me (priced with 2Mb L3 cache/512MbRam/80GHD/GeForce4/no monitor), I could manage to put 2 (maybe 3 if I squeeze the disks and monitors) people to work with even faster processing, using AMD based machines.<br />
<br />
<br />
cmcquisision:<br />
<br />
To complete an answer (you asked about the OS); either Win2k or WinXp Pro, your option. I'm more comfortable with Win2k, myself, but these two are the only one's that use 2 cpu's. Win98/ME is a consumer level operating system that ties itself into knots - not be used for professional work.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, the make Photoshop for Linux, or OS/2 ;).</div></div><hr />

no poke taken;)<br />
<br />
you are right, information on these cpu's is hard to find.  Those 2 posts are the first mac benches i've ever seen.<br />
<br />
witht hat siad and done get amd or intel.<br />
<br />
looks like good ol' mac cant keep up with the race, they in last place.<br />
<br />
I went pc also, there is no other way for the progies i use.  Plus i want to upgrade my secondary hardware in the future.<br />
<br />
btw, this is the second time in 2 weeks i have misread or misinterpreted information for posts.  Must be the end of semester thing, expunging all unnecessary information.<br />
