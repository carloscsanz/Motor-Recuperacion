<td><a NAME="1c"></a><font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he title for this&nbsp;
talk was inspired by Robert K. Merton's <u>On the Shoulders of Giants</u>.</font><sup><font size=-1><a href="#1r">1</a></font></sup><font size=+1>It
is an unusual exercise in scholarly detective work. This book is often
referred to as OTSOG. It tracks down the origins of Isaac Newton's famous&nbsp;
aphorism "If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of
giants."</font>

<br><a NAME="2-3-4-5-6c"></a><font size=+1>Robert K. Merton should not
be confused with his Nobel winning son the Harvard economist Robert C.Merton.
Robert K's association with the field of information science is quite strong.
He has probably been cited by information scientists as often, if not more
so, than many of those we recognize as pioneers of information science.
This is due in part to his pioneering work in the sociology and history
of science, but also because he is the inventor of numerous neologisms.His
"Matthew Effect"</font><sup><font size=-1><a href="#2r">2</a>,<a href="#3r">3</a></font></sup><font size=+1>has
been cited in hundreds of papers and is itself the subject of numerous
research papers including those by Manfred Bonitz of Dresden</font><sup><font size=-1><a href="#4r">4</a></font></sup><font size=+1>.&nbsp;
Another term is OBI -- Obliteration by Incorporation.</font><sup><font size=-1><a href="#5r">5</a>,<a href="#6r">6</a></font></sup>

<p><a NAME="7c"></a><font size=+1>The Mathew Effect often leads to unfair
attribution of work by two or more authors. Bob's wife Harriet Zuckerman
is an example. She is well known for her work on Nobel Prizes.</font><sup><font size=-1><a href="#7r">7

<p><a NAME="25c"></a><font size=+1>The origins of <u>Current Contents </u>seems
to interest a lot of people. How did you manage to start it? I wrote an
essay on this called " How It All Began : With a Loan from HFC."<sup><a href="#25r">25</a></sup>I've
lost touch with Richard Gremling of Bell Labs but he gave me a contract
to produce a customized edition of <u>CC</u>. However, I didn't have the
sense to ask for an advance payment.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In order to pay the printer, I had to raise $500 so I
could deliver the first issue. None of the banks would lend me money, so
I went to HFC and got the money in about 10 minutes.</font>

<p><font size=+1>In those days, 6% per annum was normal bank interest.HFC
charged 18% but you didn't have to keep the money for several months.So
it turned out to be cheaper to pay 18% without service charges. And to
get around the state law of a $500 maximum I went to different branches
of&nbsp; HFC. No computer records in those days!</font>

<p><font size=+1>In a short personal retrospective, time does not allow
me to cover all the people and events covering almost half a century. Many
of&nbsp; you know that I started <u>Current Contents</u><sup>&reg;</sup>/Life
Sciences in the 50s. ASIS people rarely know that my first contents page
endeavor was in the field of documentation itself. I don't even have a
copy of <u>Contents in Advance</u>, which I started at Welch in late 1952.&nbsp;
Later on it got me into hot water with my boss.</font>
<p><a NAME="23c"></a><font size=+1>The Life Sciences edition of <u>Current
Contents</u> became an official subscription service in 1958. Charlotte
Studer was the special librarian at Miles Labs who gave me a contract in1957.
However, the putative social sciences edition started in 1954 with the
name <u>Management's DocuMation Preview</u>. I called my company DocuMation,Inc.
which made Mort Taube very angry since he had founded Documentation, Inc.
in 1953. When we changed the name of MDP to <u>Current Contents </u>around
1955, I also changed the company name to Eugene Garfield Associates,Information
Engineers. Mort was mollified but the new name made the Pennsylvania professional
licensing board angry because I did not have an engineering degree. So
I dropped the subtitle information engineers. Then in 1960 I changed the
name to the Institute for Scientific Information under the inspiration
of the Russian VINITI. I bragged that we could do with 20 people what they
could do with 20,000.<sup><a href="#23r">23</a></sup></font>
<p><font size=+1>What is significant about <u>Current Contents</u> vis-&agrave;-visASIS
is somewhat bittersweet. <u>CC</u><sup>&reg;</sup> has never been discussed
seriously in the literature of information science. Even Brad Rogers said
<u>Current&nbsp;
Contents</u> was a "sop to appease the guilty conscienceof doctors who
don't read" or words to that effect. He had underestimated the importance
of timeliness and simplicity, the essence of he original <u>Current List
of Medical Literature</u> started by Atherton Seidel during the war.The
problem with <u>Current Contents</u> is that it is so simple and utilitarian
that it gives theoreticians little to talk about. Current awareness isone
thing -- information retrieval is something else. It is somewhat telling
that when I taught at the Moore School of Engineering at Penn in the 60s,the
engineers called <u>CC</u> an information retrieval tool!</font>

to see old colleagues until it is too late. I was in regular contact by
mail and phone with Andy Aines until he died.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I am delighted that so many old timers have been able
to come to this meeting but there are many who are absent. Just last weekI
was able to contact Seymour Taine after a 20-year hiatus. And I'm gladto
say that Estelle Brodman, that doyenne of medical librarians and historians,
is still with us. The MLA showed a remarkable video interview with her
at the 100<sup>th</sup> Anniversary meeting in Philadelphia. I was delighted
to hear that Fred Kilgour was able to come I need not elaborate on his
contributions to library and information science, in particular OCLC.</font>

<p><font size=+1>In the last few minutes, I would like just to run through&nbsp;
some of the remaining photos I was able to assemble. I do hope that ASIS

field.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Another non-traditional information pioneer I should mentionis
Pierre Vinken. A neurosurgeon and editor, I met him in the 1950s whenthe
Excerpta Medica Foundation was established. He converted this to a commercial
enterprise which has become one of the world's largest publishing conglomerates
-- Reed Elsevier.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>There are dozens of other publisher friends I could mention
like Tom Karger, Gunter Heyden, Per Saugman and others. On the other hand,this
reflection would not be complete without mentioning Robert Maxwell.We met
in the late 50s. Over the next 35 years he tried to acquire my company&nbsp;&nbsp;
in one way or another. I've briefly described our relations in the oral
interview recently recorded by Bob Williams. One day I will describe in
detail about how he tried but failed. He was a diabolical, driven genius.Fortunately,
the competitive world of publishing is full of people who live and let
live.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I have also not mentioned the dozens of science editors
who are part of this scholarly publishing world such as Stephen Lock, Arnold&nbsp;
Relman, Drummond Rennie, George Lundberg, and Dan Koshland. I first met&nbsp;
Dan when I joined the Board of Annual Reviews. He retired as editor of
<u>Science
</u>and
recently received the Lasker Award.</font>

<p><font size=+1>Let me now quickly run through my remaining collection&nbsp;
of photos. My world of information science has been very broad in its scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, I have not really touched on the field of science communication
which has been my main concern, not only in the indexing and abstracting&nbsp;
of the literature, but also in its reporting as exemplified by my newspaper,
<u>The
Scientist</u>. I think it is reasonable to state that it was the first
full-text journal available on the Internet. <u>The Scientist</u> was the
culmination of my 35 years of writing essays in <u>Current Contents</u>.That
series of over 1,000 essays appeared in <u>CC</u> because I realized early
on that readers found going through <u>CC</u> a necessary chore and the
essays and cartoons gave them something concrete and amusing to read.I
also had the unique opportunity to deliver a weekly message to readers
behind the iron curtain. Hence my frequent allusion to the old adage that
you are a prophet in a foreign land.</font>
<p><font size=+1>As a concluding remark, let me say why I have always looked
to ASIS as my home base. While I have been a member of many societies including,ACS,
ACM, IEEE, ALA, SLA, History of Science Society, and the NASW, I'vealways
considered ASIS my primary professional home base. ASIS provideda link
between my friends and competitors in the non-profit as well as for-profit
worlds -- the link between academia, government and industry.However, I
have always been critical of ASIS's failure or unwillingness to link theory
with practice -- science and technology. I hope that inthe next several
years as I serve as a Board member and President-Elect that I can not only
help build bridges in those areas so that ASIS cannot only survive but
grow and thrive the new millenium.</font>
