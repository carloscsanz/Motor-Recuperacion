I'm not really connecting with any of the characters here.<br />

<br />
I mean really their original idea wasn't even remotely unique.  Tons of people were creating social networking sites, and had been for years. Friendster started in 2002. <br />
<br />
So they talked to Zuckerberg for a couple days, then he stopped talking to them. And then a couple of months later he launched his own similar site. So what? Why does he owe them anything? They didn't <i>give</i> him anything? 
<blockquote><i>It makes me wonder how they got these IM conversations.</i></blockquote>

The Winklevoss's sued facebook at some point, and they got a large settlement.  They want to take credit for the site, so I imagine they're giving this stuff out to anyone who will listen.<br />

<br />
I have no idea why they're going long on this story, but I can surmise a couple of thoughts on the apathy surrounding it:<br />
<br />
Even though nobody, aside from Facebook's press team, is going to come out in defense of Zuckerberg, a kid who trumped everyone in the internets business, absolutely no one is going to come out in defense of three idea guys who's accumulated expertise resulted in no execution. It goes contrary to the ethos of the community.<br />
<br />
Is Zuckerberg a douche for reading people's email? Yeah, he is, but all he did was get granular on the types of activities the US engages in as a whole, activities that make douchebags out of all of us.<br />

<br />
The whole reason for formal agreements for things like this is not only to prevent getting ripped off, but also to prevent people from coming after you and claiming because they had a conversation with you, you owe them everything.<br />

		<div class="comments">Pretty much every successful company I know about has some awkwardness in the foundation story. There's always a Pete Best that was there at the start but everyone would rather not talk about, a few George Martins who did real work but don't get much credit, and legions of people who have delusions they were the Fifth Beatle that made the magic work.<br />
<br />
That's why it's so important that startups get the legal stuff right, from the very start. Way too much heartache in the handshakes and &quot;understandings&quot; that are common. OTOH lawyers are expensive and distracting and you're much better off spending the time actually building a product. The only solution to this Catch 22 is to work ethically with people you truly trust. Even then it often ends up going badly.<br />
<br />
The quoted emails from Zuckerberg sound awfully unethical. Not just an awkward beginning, but a deliberate attempt to shut out some folks who thought they were working together with him. It's all ancient history now, a matter for lawyers, but if you ever plan to start something that might get big you can learn from it.<br />

<br />
Yeah because everyone knows that allegations become null and void once they become dated (even if they are supported by more recently discovered IM logs). It's the playground rule!<br />
<br />

</em>--delmo<br />
<br />
The article mentions paying the previous programmer, which implies they were paying him. I'm really puzzled by this logic. By definition if you are hired to do programming, then the person hiring you isn't doing the programming themselves. Do you therefore own all the programming you are doing? Do the people who work for Microsoft own Microsoft Word? Really questionable ethics being promoted here.<br />

		<div class="comments">I'm sure the Winklevoss twins honestly think they have an important story here. They had an idea for a social site, and that dastardly Zuckerberg snatched their success like the thieving brat he is! That's how every single person who's never tried to make a web site thinks the Internet works. They're not idiots, but they're very, very misguided.<br />
<br />
The thing with design is, the original idea doesn't matter much. There're lots of great ideas for web sites that've been tried and which completely bombed. Facebook wasn't a brilliant idea in and of itself. What mattered was the way it got executed, which was all Zuckerberg's doing. It was his design choices that made the site so addicting, and that've made it the second most-visited site on the planet.<br />
<br />
I do web design. I launched a social network last year (well, <a href="http://notadouche.com">kind of a social network</a>) that got a thousand sign-ups in a day. So I have a reputation among my group of friends as That Guy Who Makes Popular Things. But when I sit down to work on things with friends, it becomes pretty obvious that most of them see the Internet not as a large group of people, each of whom is trying to go on with his or her life, but rather as a pile of money that you can just take whenever you want. <br />
<br />
It's kind of pathetic. &quot;We'll make a news site. People will pay you money if you tell them the news, right?&quot; But I'm certain that if, say, I come up with some brilliant idea for selling the news and it makes money, I'll be accused of plagiarism by the &quot;make a news site&quot; friend. Because it's news! That was his idea!<br />
<br />
As far as implementation and marketing is concerned, Mark Zuckerberg's a genius. He's been a role model of mine for years, ever since I worked with a team working on a similar project. Say what you will about his being a dweeb and an ass and a Steve Jobs wannabe, he's shown a remarkable determination for having his way with Facebook, and he's turned it into one of the largest enterprises online. <br />
<br />
Is it surprising that he sounded like a jerk 19-year-old when he was 19? Only if you're the sort of person that thinks you can't be a brilliant entrepreneur and also be human. People are people. It's not a crime.<br />

Ugh, you make it sound like ethics and morality are merely a matter of pragmatics.  &quot;Make sure you don't screw people over because things might get complicated!&quot;  And &quot;ancient history now&quot; sounds like the reason we keep letting the GOP off the hook.

		<div class="comments">I think it is <i>really</i> important, when digesting this story, to put it in context. It is not like these kids were working in a lab and realized they stumbled upon the discovery of the microchip. What they were doing was not novel or innovative. Look at it this way, the dating site Harvard Connection. What is the market cap for something like that? Single, alumnis of Harvard who are willing to pay for a dating site and only want to date other Harvardians. Small beans. Zuckerberg's site was also small beans.<br />
<br />
But that's fine, sometimes things take off and there's no real reason for it. Some things are really obvious, like Watt's steam engine, but the vast majority of things taking off occur for no real reason at all. Zuckerberg was simply at the right place at the right time.<br />
<br />
And if the stars didn't align to make Facebook take off where others have failed, we'd probably only know Zuckerberg as the programmer at Morgan Stanley who doesn't seem to understand why anyone at the office likes him.<br />

And it does seem here that Zuckerberg was manipulating that moment in a way that, if the HarvardConnect people had been more scrupulous about signed agreements, would have been a straight-up act of sue-able ripoff. Sure, they should have been more scrupulous, but the moral point stands.<br />

<br />
Actually, no.  Unless you have signed a contract stating that you are doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire">&quot;work for hire&quot;</a> then a programmer retains all rights to the code she creates.  So if Zuckerberg was not under a work for hire agreement, he legally has as much right to use the code as the people who paid him to write it.<br />

		<div class="comments">When I was in middle school, I went to privileged smart-kid camp (my parents and I didn't know!  Really!  We just thought it was good-opportunity-for-smart-kid camp!  I'm really not a tool...or rich) at Amherst.  Zuckerberg's younger sister was in my dorm group and we were friendly.  She was kind of a weirdo, but I guess everyone's kind of a weirdo when they're 13.  She was into Wicca stuff and would always talk about how she put spells on people.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since these were the days before Facebook, we lost touch after camp.  Years later, when I was doing my prospective student overnight thing at the college I eventually attended, I was going on a dormitory tour (coincidentally in the same house of the same dorm I would eventually be placed into).  My group was waiting to get on the elevator when the doors opened and who but the same Zuckerberg sister was standing there with a pile of dirty laundry to go down to the basement.  We had one of those &quot;are you___?  we went to ___ together, right?  weird!&quot; awkward exchanges while the doors slowly shut and we went our separate ways.  <br />
<br />
When I got to school, I learned that the Zuckerberg sister had been in my house the year before, and was one of the few second-years who left for another dorm.  (It's a very close-knit housing system.)  When I told everyone the camp/elevator story, people all said, &quot;yeah, she's the sister of the Facebook guy...her family is loaded.&quot;  I saw her a few times in passing on campus, but never had a chance to talk to her again so I don't know if she's still a weirdo.  <br />
<br />
I think she's married now and is in grad school at Harvard.<br />

Well, they certainly don't own the programming they're not paying me for.  That's why people have <i>intellectual property agreements</i> and <i>hiring contracts</i>.  If you've got an informal &quot;understanding&quot; with someone, then you can't run around and claim you own anything they create ever for the rest of eternity.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, you &quot;own&quot; the code you write unless you explicitly sign something saying who owns the code, or you're a <b>non-contract</b> employee writing code at an office, on employer's machines. <br />
<br />
(Also, the fact that they were paying the other programmer doesn't mean they were paying Zuckerberg) 
<blockquote><i>Do the people who work for Microsoft own Microsoft Word?</i></blockquote>

You don't think they have ironclad IP agreements, and clearly specified employment contracts at Microsoft?

They didn't get a cash payout, they got stock.  Which means now they're invested in Facebook's future, and how it values stocks, whether it dilutes them, etc.<br />

		<div class="comments">This is precisely why I know anything at all about websites, design, programming, etc. - when I have an idea, I like to try and execute it myself. If it requires someone else to accomplish, I have to consider &quot;is it SO good an idea that it's worth finding someone else to bring along, even if it means giving up a portion of the (assumedly large) profits?&quot;.<br />
<br />
So far, I can only think of one idea that even fits that description and I'm working on it now. I've hired a programmer whom I've worked with at 2 different jobs in the past, I record all of our IM, phone, and personal conversations (with his knowledge, of course). Our first conversation about it began with me saying &quot;I'm recording this call and I'd like you state your name for the record&quot;, which he agreed to; neither of us are out to fuck the other one over, but at least we're both covered now. For what it's worth - I'm providing all marketing materials, design, iconography, layout mechanisms, spec sheets, and a bunch of other things; pretty much everything but the underlying code. I'm not just saying &quot;here's an idea! get it done!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm in agreement with most people here - the idea these guys came to &quot;Zuck&quot; with wasn't altogether that original (certainly not $65 mil original) and ideas are very much free. I can spout off ideas all day long, but if I don't work towards executing said ideas they may as well be the drunken ramblings of a lunatic. If it was such a good idea, these guys would've tried harder to protect it. My bet is they thought &quot;this might be kind of fun, and give us some campus cred and maybe a couple of bucks in our pockets&quot;. Zuckerberg's idea was much grander a vision, and worth protecting even at the cost of fucking over a client.<br />
<br />
For them to come back all these years and billions of ad dollars later to claim &quot;he stole our idea!&quot; is far more dishonest and douchy than anything Zuck was doing.<br />

<br />
In theory. But the FBI wouldn't get involved unless there was a huge financial cost to the hacking. The worst trouble you'd get into would be to school discipline, maybe expelled. Seems really unlikely they'd come back and do anything now. <br />
<br />
The other hacking instance seems like it might have been part of why the Winklevoss's settlement was so huge. <br />
<br />
I think part of the reason why people aren't more sympathetic to Winklevoss's is that they just seem like <i>such</i> douchebags. Who wants to side with some rich entitled future MBA toolbags who were too lazy and incompetent to write their own software in the first place, and just tried to get someone else to do it for them. People who were born rich and wanted to buy success instead of actually creating it themselves.

In this new, fake profile, he listed Cameron's height as 7'4&quot;, his hair color as &quot;Ayran Blond,&quot; and his eye color as &quot;Sky Blue.&quot; He listed Cameron's &quot;language&quot; as &quot;WASP-y.&quot;</i></blockquote>

Everybody who has ever hired a programmer is lazy and incompetent?<br />
<br />
<i>At one point, Mark appears to have exploited a flaw in ConnectU's account verification process to create a fake Cameron Winklevoss account with a fake Harvard.edu email address.</i><br />
<br />
You can't create a &quot;fake&quot; harvard.edu address. This isn't gmail. Every address is tied to a student id in a 1-1 relationship. So, I guess he could have &quot;claimed&quot; Cameron Winklevoss' account and perhaps thats what they mean...<br />

Sure you can:  <i>fakity-fake-fake@harvard.edu</i>.  See?  If there's no verification email, or you can deduce the code, then you have a functioning account with a defunct, fake, email.<br />

		<div class="comments">And you know, I'm not such a hater of facebook, but I'm always surprised when people talk as if it brought something new to the internet.  When it started, the only thing really unique about it was its exclusivity.  Had it been open to everyone when it first opened, I doubt many of the Ivy Leaguers who helped establish the network effects would have joined.  It's the &quot;you can't join&quot; business model, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartmanland">well established for years</a>.<br />
<br />
The guys he screwed over weren't just trying to establish yet-another-networking site, either, from what I've read.  They were ready to spend lots of cash on events and promotion.  It sounds dumb in retrospect, but at the time it was a good theory of how to establish a strong membership base in a small community.  <br />
<br />
I'm surprised that the guys made off with millions from the lawsuit, but I'm also surprised so many people think Zuckerberg did much original.<br />

		<div class="comments">I'd agree that he didn't do anything very original, and would add that his genius mostly seems to have consisted of doing what every other developer in the world with a passing interest in social networks was doing at the time, <i>but at Harvard</i>. Lots of people can come up with ideas, and some people can execute them, but only in the white-hot reactor core of ambition that is Harvard would an embryonic social enabler seem like something worth contending, even while still in vitro. All those guys, both the douches that couldn't code and the douche that could, had from the outset a firm grasp of the fact that a social net birthed in the center of the Ivy League galaxy would eventually be a very valuable thing.<br />
