I was probably 4 when a babysitter took me to a craft type store and said she would buy me anything I wanted. Well imagine the look on her face when a little curly haired girl like me walked up to her with the head shrinking kit. She wouldn't get it for me! So I ended up painting some ceramic crap she thought was more appropriate. I still want to make one of these! I plan on watching in Nat. Geo. Special this month to learn how! I hope a have a crazy little kid like me someday:)

I finally convinced my mother I was old enough to play with this set and we brought one home.  In the midst of peeling the first apple, I cut myself so badly, I needed stitches!  Needless to say, I never say the kit again and will never know the sick pleasure of creating a shrunken head!

Man, do I remember this one! Back then, every Saturday night we sat around and watched Creature Features (with host Bob Wilkenson)...and many of those old horror shows stared, who else, Vincent Price.
 <br><br>
Needless to say that to have the ability to make my own shrunken heads with the help of Vincent Price was just too good to pass up! It was a chore though, pinning those templates onto a freshly peeled apple; but the results were tremendous!

									<font size="2">I done forgot about many of the toys we as yougins grew up with.  We had just about every toy made in the 1960's and 70's.  One thing our folk bestowed upon us each Christmas. As though Santa done came and puked toys all under the Christmas tree.  I completely forgot about Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture. I remember hanging it above a lightbulb on the special hanger and watching the creepy shape take place.  We had alot of fun with this toy. I reckon I was bout 10 years old when I got Shrunken Head. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">This was far and away the most importand toy/activity of me childhood. My nick name in school was shrinky because I always had a shrunken head apple on the end of my pencil. I used to get comissioned by the other kids to make them one for a trade, I forget what I got in return. My mother would yell at me to turn off the lamp I was using for drying (she said it cost too much for electricity) so I learned that if you left the heads on the window sill for a month they would shrink just the same. Great Great toy, I miss it just thinking about it. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">I received this for Christmas when I was 8 or 10. I promptly converted by bedroom lamp into a drying station and spent the next few years converting apples into shrunken heads.  Biggest mistake I ever made was throwing the kit away when I was about 18. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">I got this toy for Christmas when I was 10 years old.  I loved it and so did my sister.  For years I've been telling my wife about my favorite/most memorable toy.  Well, I finally found and bought one on e-bay here in 2006.  It's still cool.  I called my sister and said "I got a toy from when I was 10 and we bother loved it, it was the best".  She immediately guessed "The Srunken Head Apple thing!".  I've now made on and my 40 year old peers grin and patronize me.  So much the better, it only adds to my enjoyment. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">First of all, it had Vincent Price on the cover and in the television spots.  That alone made it cool.  Second, this allowed anyone to become a voodoo witch doctor (at least insofar as a typical American kid's voodoo education courtesy of Scooby Doo and Bugs Bunny).  I remember it took longer than my rapidly vanishing attention span could comfortably handle, and it was my brother's kit so he always had final say on what parts I was allowed to use.  But if I can find a new kit I'll buy one soon so my daughters and I can get started in time for Halloween.   <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">I gotta admit this was one of my favorite presents. Nothing says Christmas to a kid like receiving a present that includes a very sharp knife and involves a hot light bulb! LOL Sure, it might have been a little unsafe by today's standards, but at least it fostered a bit of creativity. Most of today's kids that play video games for hours on end seem to lack that same creativity. <br><br></font><br>

I stayed up all night trying to watch the apple shrink,eventualy I fell asleep. when I woke up there it was, ready for me to paint and put hair on. What a great toy endorsed by the great Vincent Price. This toy kicks any new toys ass, including all those stupid video games. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">I've still got 2 heads-one my mom and I made in 1978 (when I got the thing) and another I made by myself in '80 or so.  I made probably 6 or 8 of the things, but only these two survive.  I got in trouble for wearing the '78 model around my neck to school.  My holy-rolling math teacher wigged out and went and got the principal. He asked me if the shrunken head "helped" me in any of my classes. I looked at him for a moment and said, "It's an apple".  He looked like he wished he had never listened to the teacher, but he told me to not take it back into her class.  <br><br></font><br>

Anyhow, I digress. This kit brings back many memories for me. Loved the vincent price box... I design toy packaging now. Stuff like this is probably what inspired me in that direction. <br><br></font><br>

My older brother is a no good drunken bum these days, a total loser. I hate him for disfiguring my face. I hope he goes to hell. I live all alone and am single because nobody will date me anymore after they see the face. Please don't feel sorry for me. You have to play the hand you're dealt. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">I remember this one, but we had a different Shrunken Head maker, put out by Pressman.  You would mix a plaster type powder with water in a plastic kettle.  As you mixed you had to chant certain words to make the spell work. <br><br>
"Varoom Doom Pressman Boom,  Varoom Doom Pressman Boom.  Shrink!  Shrink! Ink-a-dink!  Shrink!  Shrink! Ink-a-dink!  Head so big, then so small.   On Doctor Vavoom I do call!" <br><br>

You would then pour the thick liquid into one of three plastic molds.  The molds were made so that they would lay flat on the table, giving you the front part of a head.   <br><br>
Then you set it aside to dry for a day or so.  You would then pop it out of the mold and it was soft and rubbery.  The kit came with fake hair that you could stick into the head.  The head at this point was about 4 inches long by 3 inches wide. <br><br>
Now you set it aside to dry for several days, and during the drying prcoess, the head would shrink and get hard.  Once it was dry (a little like Crayola's Modelling Magic), you could paint it. <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">Ah, the memory of looking at the teacher's face when she saw the dried app *ahem* shrunken heads hanging from the belt of my Hallowe'en costume! Since I had sewn the eyes and lips shut instead of using the black and white beads the things were pretty morbid.I wish I still had the kit, I want to do that 'Mad Druid' costume again... <br><br></font><br>

									<font size="2">This was cool when it was finished. More of a craft. But GOD! that smell. It burned itself into my brain for life. I can smell it now. Brings back great memories. I could stare at that box forever too. <br><br></font><br>
