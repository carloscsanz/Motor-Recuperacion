"/en/Social_network_service">social networking</a> website that is
operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc.
<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> Since September 2006, anyone over the
age of 13 with a valid e-mail address (and not residing in one of
the countries where it is banned) can become a Facebook user. Users
can add friends and send them messages, and update their personal
profiles to notify friends about themselves. Additionally, users
can join networks organized by city, workplace, and school or
college. The website&#39;s name stems from the colloquial name of
books given at the start of the academic year by university
administrations in the <a href="/en/US">US</a> with the intention
of helping students to get to know each other better.</p>
<p class="root"><a href="/en/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>
founded Facebook with his college roommates and fellow computer
science students <a href="/en/Eduardo_Saverin">Eduardo Saverin</a>,
<a href="/en/Dustin_Moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</a> and <a href=
"/en/Chris_Hughes_(Facebook)">Chris Hughes</a> while he was a
student at <a href="/en/Harvard_University">Harvard
University</a>.<sup class="Template-Fact" title=
"This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2010">[<em><a href="/en/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation
needed</a></em>]</sup> <sup><small>[5]</small></sup> The
website&#39;s membership was initially limited by the founders to
Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston
area, the <a href="/en/Ivy_League">Ivy League</a>, and <a href=
"/en/Stanford_University">Stanford University</a>. It later
expanded further to include (potentially) any university student,
then high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and
over. The website currently has more than 400 million active users
worldwide. <sup><small>[6]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">The original concept for Facebook was borrowed from
a product produced by Zuckerberg&#39;s prep school <a href=
"/en/Phillips_Exeter_Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> which for
decades published and distributed a printed manual of all students
and faculty, unofficially called the &quot;face book&quot;.</p>
<p class="root">Facebook has met with some <a href=
"/en/Criticism_of_Facebook">controversy</a>. It has been blocked
intermittently in several countries including Syria,
<sup><small>[7]</small></sup> China, <sup><small>[8]</small></sup>
Vietnam, <sup><small>[9]</small></sup> and Iran.
<sup><small>[10]</small></sup> It has also been banned at many
places of work to discourage employees from wasting time using the
service. <sup><small>[11]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root"><a href=
"/en/Criticism_of_Facebook#Privacy_concerns">Privacy</a> has also
been an issue, and it has been compromised several times. Facebook
settled a lawsuit regarding claims over source code and
intellectual property. <sup><small>[12]</small></sup> The site has
also been involved in controversy over the sale of fans and
friends. <sup><small>[13]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">A January 2009 <a href=
"/en/Compete.com">Compete.com</a> study ranked Facebook as the most
used social network by worldwide monthly active users, followed by
<a href="/en/MySpace">MySpace</a>. <sup><small>[14]</small></sup>
<em><a href="/en/Entertainment_Weekly">Entertainment
Weekly</a></em> put it on its end-of-the-decade &#39;best-of&#39;
list, saying, &quot;How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember
our co-workers&#39; birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing
game of Scrabulous before Facebook?&quot;
<sup><small>[15]</small></sup></p>
<p class="root">There have recently been reports of Facebook
proposing an <a href="/en/Initial_public_offering">initial public
offering</a> (IPO), i.e. issue equity shares as stock to investors.
However, Zuckerberg stresses that it will not be for a few more
years, and the company is in no need of additional capital.
<sup><small>[16]</small></sup> <sup><small>[17]</small></sup> Also,
some analysts fear the Facebook IPO might be a particularly weak
one. <sup><small>[18]</small></sup></p>
