All of these features are included in the standard version of each yacht.

- Carbon fiber hull: SeaBoater yacht hulls are based on selected SP systems laminating materials combined with a foam sandwich to ensure the highest structural integrity, where most furniture and fittings double as structure, minimizing redundancy and weight, thus enhancing dynamic responses and making SeaBoater yachts safer.

- Hydraulic lifting keel: The modern lift keel system helps give the yacht increased stability when sailing, while the  minimum lift up draft allows for easy access to harbors and anchorages.

- Flush Carbon Hatches: Flush Carbon Hatches provide more than a fully modern look: they have double seals for ultimate waterproofing and offer protection from corrosion (constructed from carbon fiber).

- Foldaway Anchor System: The anchoring system stows below the deck and aft of the bow. As a practical convenience, the anchor may be manually or hydraulically swung into position.

- Retractable carbon bow prod: The retractable gennaker pole enables yacht crews to fly a gennaker in the most optimum manner with minimal crew. The carbon bow prod may be retracted and made invisible.

- Advanced hydraulic system: The complex and modern hydraulic system controls every aspect of navigation.

- Ecology/FREE fuel: On top of everything, we are proud to announce that SeaBoater is the first yacht in its range to  implement Hybid (Electric/Diesel) and Solar Hybrid Solar/Electric/Diesel) technology.

Her interior design is by Mieske Design and offers light functional and relaxed styling featuring beautiful woodwork and an intelligent layout for maximising space.

HANSE EXPLORER is available for special yacht charters in the following locations:

July to September, 2008: Arctic (Spitsbergen / Svalbard, Iceland, Greenland, Canadian Arctic).
November, 2008 to March, 2009: Antarctic Peninsula and Chilean Fjords.

HANSE EXPLORER is a certified ice breaker yacht (with an extra thick steel hull) with ice class GL-E3. HANSE EXPLORER is able to explore all around the world, including the polar regions and the Northwest Passage. Safety and comfort rank first on the incredible luxury explorer yacht.

HANSE EXPLORER has a powerful main motor ( MAK 8 M 20 1 x 1,360 kW, Single Screw, Controllable Pitch Propeller) with an electric stand-by motor (400 KW) in case of main failure. She can cruise at 11 knots with a max of 13. Her generators produce a total electric power capacity of approx. 1.000 kilowatts.

She has two independently working air conditioning compressors which provide a pleasant room temperature in tropic areas as well as in arctic and Antarctic waters. There is two independent heating systems generating the necessary heat for comfort. Two autarkic fresh water systems (osmosis device/evaporator) provide sufficient fresh water on board.

She also has independent toilet facilities (vacuum/gravity toilet). To protect the environment there is a highly efficient water conditioning system that allows the yacht to cruise even the most sensitive areas of the world.

Highly efficient stabilisers reduce the vessel�s role and ensures that it is also comfortable to stay on board during heavy sea. The bridge equipment complies with those of the modern chemical tank ships the shipping company runs as well. There are two independently working rudder devices (electro-hydraulic/manual) and three radar units: one S-band radar system (harbor-zone, near-shore zone and ice cruise) and two X-band systems, one for deep sea and coastal shipping and the other one for cadets and guests.

HANSE EXPLORER also has latest up to date electronic navigational charts including secondary device in the lounge so that our guests can observe the position of the vessel any time.

Luxury motor yacht SEA FORCE ONE is a striking contemporary styled luxury yacht which was built by A.M.Y. Yachts - a joint venture between CNL and T.Mariotti of Genoa with interior design by Luca Dini Design.

The luxury yacht�s chic shiny black hull, authoritative dark grey superstructure and abundance of open spaces generate a bold profile and an audacious presence on the water. Indeed, her silhouette is purposeful, and almost imposing, as well as sinuous and lyth. This is due to the lateral rounding off of the silver grey superstructure and the combined affects of shape and colour.

Thanks to Luca Dini Design, the overall theme of the superyacht could be conveyed with the words: style, luxury, comfort, elegance and absolute entertainment. With accommodation of up to 10 yacht charter guests, in 5 cabins, (with separate room for around 12 crew members), the spacious motor yacht expands over four decks. SEA FORCE ONE provides an underwater hull shape which allows her to cruise at over 15 knots, reaching a max speed of 18 knots; while her zero speed stabilizers provide requisite stability and comfort. 

SEA FORCE ONE represents a unique opportunity to charter an extraordinary yacht, a yacht which won the 2009 Judges� Commendation in the World Superyacht Awards in the BEST DISPLACEMENT MOTOR YACHT OF 500GT TO 1,299GT (APPROX 50M - 59M) section. The yachting awards observe excellence in the design and building of superyachts as well as recognize the considerable talents of the builders, naval architects and yacht designers who create the most outstanding superyachts of the year. M/Y SEA FORCE ONE�s astonishing design, styling and d?cor has underlined a new standard in the yachting world and yacht charter market. 

Generous interior spaces are connected to exterior sun, breeze and entertainment areas via wide floor to ceiling doors, balconies and skylights. As if she were lacking in functional outside areas for sunning and enjoying the passing view, motor yacht SEA FORCE ONE even boasts an automatically folding private owner�s balcony, which adjoins the side of the yacht at the master suit. 

As for the superyacht�s interior, the latest in sophisticated LED lighting and music systems are integrated throughout the charter yacht. This technology blends with flowing curves and rigid lines in facilitating your complete immersion into another world. A formidable home cinema and a disco bar complete the motor yacht�s superior electrical entertainment experience. 

Leather floors and soft fabrics create lavish comforts, while Barrisol ceilings and interesting colourful art make this luxury yacht an amazing entertaining venue in the evenings. During the day, the aft swimming area, the beach, and the impressive sundeck - with Jacuzzi pool forward - conspire to make it a hardship to leave SEA FORCE ONE.

The owner�s master suite, and the four other guest cabins, share are captivating expression of interior design - and while similar they are also themed quite differently in d?cor and colour, thereby providing those lucky enough to stay aboard with unique experiences as they pass from one area to another. 

SEA FORCE ONE conforms to the �RINA�s Green Star� code which assures compliance with the strictest regulations around the world, in terms of environmental protection.

G. 62 foot powercat is designed on these principles and built at the new dockyard facilities of V. G. Shipyard Yacht. Exploiting every catamaran potentiality comes an extraordinary new vessel uniquely suited to match elevated performance with low fuel consumption, luxury with practicality. An exciting yacht design that goes beyond what has been offered so far anywhere else in the world. The primary objective of the project is to achieve maximum quality based on robust fundamentals of seaworthiness, strength, performance, safety, reliability, comfort and elegance combined. All indispensable requirements for an ultramodern Mediterranean luxury powercat that cruises seas at 20 knots yet enters shallows with the greatest of ease. The hull and deck are constructed of woven fiberglass, vinyl resin and PVC foams of differing densities, depending upon the rigidity-flexibility demands of the entire laminate. The long-lasting quality of the durable finished product is ensured by the utilization of the Vacuum Infusion Process during lamination. This powerful pleasure craft is a proud emblem of Italian style and engineering, both in terms of her technical profile and her masterful design. The catamaran hull is the result of extensive hydrodynamic testing in a Froude s tank to guarantee maximum performance and stability, while the topside is distinguished by a sleek, aerodynamic sheer with discreet vertical bulwarks. The cockpit is spacious and the fully equipped galley opens to a luxurious drawing-room with large sliding glass doors. Gangways are comfortable throughout and stratified glass partitions grant excellent visibility from all angles. The distinctive fly-bridge hosts an area for guests and owner, connecting below deck via stairs and panoramic gangways. The primary wheel house is located on the fly-bridge, but the design is predisposed for a second internal wheel house if so desired. Interior rooms are all well-lighted for night and illuminated naturally with ample bulwark windows by day. They are ventilated and air-conditioned, with many special comforts including a stereo hi-fi system, centralized in the base model, plus LCD television. The cabins have queen-size beds, spacious bathrooms and separate showers. Meticulous attention to detail is given at every stage, from personalized design elements to finished construction and launch, combining performance, looks and luxury balanced to perfection, Italian-style. This superb craft possesses numerous characteristics unique to her class, particularly her superior roominess, both topside and inside, compared to a monohull powerboat of similar length (20% more enjoyment space.) She is safer, more stable and faster, plus she goes places that other vessels just cannot achieve thanks to her shallow draft.

She is one of the hot yachts in demand for this summer. This superb superyacht provides luxury accommodation for up to 12 guests in 5 cabins and she has a fantastic crew for select charters vacations in the Mediterranean. 

Nuvolari & Lenard and Palmer Johnsons' stunning new 150' sport yacht is the new larger version of the much acclaimed 120�. Hokulani is the new Palmer & Johnson flag ship. This luxury motor yacht offers a sleek raised pilothouse which has masterfully fused fashion and function. 

The Palmer Johnson 150� has some revolutionary new ideas too, such as a fly-bridge which features a glass atrium roof panel that slides fore & aft. Like a convertible sports car you can choose to cruise either in the sun or in the shade! Further clever uses of space include a custom swim platform with a self-deploying ladder and a hydraulically powered tender garage. 

HOKULANI is built with an aluminum hull and a combination FRP/Aluminum superstructure which keeps her weight down (and her speed up). To help ensure this, the new Palmer 150� is powered by a pair of MTU 16V4000 DDEC marine diesels rated at 3,650 hp. These massive engines will spin ZF 4-5 blade props @2100 rpm�s and are located in tunnel pockets recessed into a fully planning hull. This is a very large yacht to be planning at this speed.

Whilst performance details aren�t available yet, her aerodynamically correct design should make this new yacht as fast as she looks. She is certain to provide guests with an exhilarating ride with style and comfort. She is an ideal Mediterranean yacht for first rate yacht charter vacations.

**SPECIAL - BOOK HOKULANI NOW FOR SUMMER 2009 AND PAY ONLY EUR 160,000 P/WK HIGH SEASON & EUR 140,000 P/WK LOW SEASON + EXPENSES.

 It is the slowest and the hardest of the World Formula 1 Championship. 

 To win in Monaco is hard because even a small error in the streets of the principality is fatal.

 The first Grand Prix of Monaco was won by William Grover-Williams, then followed by others great names like Schumacher, Senna, Prost, Fangio, Graham Hill

 Coming to the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Monaco is one moment unforgettable that you must anticipate and prepare. 

 Through this site, we propose all information and a team of professionals charged to assist you in the organization of your stay: hotel, tickets, terrace, yacht, limousine, restaurant. The Automobile Club of Monaco (ACM) was set up in 1925 following to a Generally Assembly attended by 55 members of the SVAM, the Monegasque Bicycle and Automobile Sports Club, which was created in 1890 under the name Monegasque Bicycle Sports Club. It had been renamed in 1907 due to the fact that the importance of motor vehicles had become stronger and stronger. 

 The Commissioner General, Anthony Noghes was appointed to present the application of the Automobile Club of Monaco for joining the Association of Certified Automobile Clubs in Paris, currently known as FIA (Federation Internationale de l�Automobile). The application was refused because none of the organized events took place on Monegasque territory. 

Noges committed himself to the crazy project of setting up a race circuit in Monaco and attending the race. With the support of Louis Chiron, the members of the Club as well as the Prince, as Honorary President of the Automobile Club of Monaco, Noghes implemented the event. On April 14th, 1929, Prince Pierre inaugurated the circuit of the 1st Grand Prix of Monaco with a lap of honour in a Torpedo Voisin car driven by the director of the circuit, Charles Faroux. 

The young Monegasque driver Louis Chiron was absent as he participated in the500 Miles of Indianapolis. 

�Williams� won the Grand Prix in a Bugatti 35 B car in 3h56�11� with an average speed of 80.194 km/h. The race was a genuine triumph. 

On April 19th, 1932, Captain Sir Malcom Campbell, the man who just had broken the world speed record with 408.621 km per hour, opened the 2nd Grand Prix of Monaco in a superb Torpedo Rolls Royce. 

From 1938 to 1947, the Grand Prix did not take place because of economic reasons, a lack of participants and a period which was not appropriate. On May 16th, 1948, the competition started again, but the year after the race was cancelled due to the death of Prince Louis II. 

Juan Manuel Fangio was the winner of the 11th edition on May 21st, 1950. Then, a race was organized in 1952, but after, various cancellations took place. Since May 1st, 1955, the Grand Prix of Monaco is one of the most expected moments in the Formula One Championship.
