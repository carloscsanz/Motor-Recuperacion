<p>You'll start off with a scene involving a plane crash, and you'll end up swimming in the ocean. Around you will be flames. Head toward the one gap in the flames, then to the lighthouse you see. There are no enemies in this area.
</p><p>Head inside and into the bathysphere, the submarine/elevator looking thing. Walk up to the handle inside and press the action button. You'll see another scene. 
</p><p>When the bathysphere stops, and everything settles down, you'll hear someone named Atlas giving you instructions over the radio. The first things he asks you to do is pick up the radio. It's just to the left of the bathysphere door.
</p><p>Head outside, to the left, and up the stairs. You'll see a splicer being chased off by a security bot. Pick up the wrench and smash the debris blocking your path. At the top of these stairs is a flaming couch that someone will push toward you. Head all the way to the left to avoid it.
</p><p>At the top of the stairs is a splicer. Use your wrench to kill him. They go down faster if you hit them in the head. Look around and you'll find some food, which restores your health. In this game you eat food as soon as you find it.
</p><p>Throughout this game, resources like food and ammo are often lying around. You'll also find items in containers, trashcans, and on corpses. It's important to search every area you go through because these items are necessary to get through the game. 
</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_Welcome_to_Rapture_map.jpg" class="image" title="Bioshock Welcome to Rapture map.jpg"><img alt="" src="/images/thumb/9/9c/Bioshock_Welcome_to_Rapture_map.jpg/700px-Bioshock_Welcome_to_Rapture_map.jpg" width="700" height="273" border="0" /></a></span></div>
<p>Go up the stairs to the vending machine and get your first plasmid, Electro Bolt. You'll see a cut scene. When you wake up head over to the door. Use Electro Bolt on the electrical door controls. This will open the door. Go through the hall, and when your airplane crashes through the glass just keep moving forward. On the other side of the hall are Eve hypos and food. 
</p><p>You'll have to deal with a few splicers here. Atlas recommends the "One-Two Punch." That is, shoot them with Electro Bolt to stun them, then wack them with the wrench. You may have to repeat this a few times before the splicer goes down. 
</p><p>Head up the elevator and listen to Atlas's speech. 
</p><p>At the top, to the left is a small memorial with some food. To the right is a hallway with a splicer crying over a baby carriage. Sneak up behind her and kill her with the wrench. Inside the baby carriage is a revolver. Pick up the gun and move forward.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/index.php/Image:BioShock_audio_diary_01.jpg" class="image" title="An audio diary. Listen to these to learn more about Rapture."><img alt="An audio diary.

Listen to these to learn more about Rapture.</div></div></div>
<p>Enter the Kashmir Restaurant. Here you'll find your first audio dairy. These are tape recorders scattered throughout the game. Much of the storyline is told through these tapes, so if you're interested in the story of Rapture, try to gather as many as you can find. If you're playing on an Xbox 360 and gather all 122 of them you'll get the 50 point "Historian" achievement. 
</p><p>You'll also hear two people arguing in the restaurant. You can go down the stairs and kill them if you want. Exit the restaurant by hole in the back of the men's room.
</p><p>In the next room you'll see a scene introducing Little Sisters. The enemies in this area will not attack you.  Go across the lighting scaffolds and down the stairs. Use your wrench to break the lock on the door. Be sure to loot the bodies of the dead splicers. 
</p><p>Around the next corner is a splicer armed with a gun. Use Electro Bolt followed up by the wrench or pistol. If you aren't happy with your performance, don't worry. There's another splicer around the next corner. 
</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs are two splicers standing in water. Electro Bolt is extra effective in water. Don't forget to loot the corpse of the big daddy next to them.
</p><p>You'll see the entrance to Neptune's Bounty, but as you get close, it will become sealed off. You'll be attacked by several splicers. Try to get them as they're standing in the water at the bottom of the stairs, where they're most vulnerable to Electro Bolt. This will be your first real fight in the game. There are bandages next to one of the toilets in the bathroom.
</p><p>You can then head over to the Medical Pavilion.
</p>
<a name="Medical_Pavilion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Medical Pavilion</span></h2>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_Medical_Pavilion_map.jpg" class="image" title="Bioshock Medical Pavilion map.jpg"><img alt="" src="/images/thumb/e/eb/Bioshock_Medical_Pavilion_map.jpg/700px-Bioshock_Medical_Pavilion_map.jpg" width="700" height="272" border="0" /></a></span></div>
<p>In the first room you'll find a cash register with some money and food. On the other end of the room is a clown themed, "Circus of Values" vending machine. Buy whatever you need: first aid, Eve, or ammo. You should try to hack the machine first, to get a discount on the items. To the left of the machine is disabled security bot. Hack it and it will fight for you.
</p><p>Move through the hole in the wall where you found the bot, and kill the two splicers you find. Head up the stairs and activate the switch. The door behind you will open. Go through it. Kill the splicer you find, and go through the hall. 
</p><p>You'll find a machine gun here. Pick it up, because you'll need it soon. Use the switch and a bunch of splicers will start heading for you. Your best defense may be to fight in the narrow hallway you just went through. The hall channels the splicers into a small space where they are easy to attack, and they can't flank you.
</p><p>Head back to the cash register, and go up the stairs you see. The door here was unlocked by the switch you pulled. This door will take you to the main section of the Medical Pavilion. 
</p><p>There are three gun turrets in this room. Use Electro Bolt, then hack them. Once you do, they'll shoot at any splicer they see. 
</p><p>Clear out this area, then go through the door that's labeled "Dr. Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals." It's on the main level, on the west side. In this glass walkway, look off to the left and you'll see a Big Daddy and Little Sister through the glass.
</p><p>This is the Surgery Wing. In this first room, someone will throw an explosive at you, then run away and block the door with debris. 
</p><p>Your new mission will be to find a way to blast the debris away. To do this you'll have to get a new plasmid: Telekinesis. There are advertisements on the walls telling you that the dental area has free plasmids, so that's where you should go. Head back to the main section of the Medical Pavilion.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_telekinesis_hint.jpg" class="image" title="This sign is your hint to go to the dental area."><img alt="This sign is your hint to go to the dental area." src="/images/thumb/1/15/Bioshock_telekinesis_hint.jpg/180px-Bioshock_telekinesis_hint.jpg" width="180" height="95" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_telekinesis_hint.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>This sign is your hint to go to the dental area.</div></div></div>
<p>If you go to the dental area, you'll see it's blocked by ice. To melt it you'll need the Incinerate Plasmid. Head to the southwest corner of the pavilion to a place called Eternal Flame. There is a Nitro splicer who will throw Molotov cocktails at you. 
</p><p>Inside you'll find a body ready to be cremated. Push the button to send it into the furnace, and when it comes out, you'll find a gene tonic called Hacker's Delight.
</p><p>Head up the stairs and find a locked off room. There is a small hole in one corner that you can use to enter and grab the Incinerate Plasmid. When you do, a bunch of splicers will surround the room. Use Incinerate to light the oil on the floor on fire. This will take care of the splicers.
</p><p>To the southwest is an area called Chompers Dental. You don't have to go here, but you will find a good amount of loot. To get in the section on the southwest corner, look for a window with a corpse hanging out of it. On the other side of that broken window you'll be able to see the door key hanging on a post. Use Telekinesis to grab it. The other area can be accessed by crouching and walking through the open windows just south of the corpse-window.
</p><p>Head back to the main section of the medical pavilion, and go down the stairs. Use Incinerate to melt the ice and let you through. There are items in the ice that you can get once it melts.

<p>The next area is dark, but in the center of the room is a shotgun. When you pick it up, you'll be ambushed by splicers coming out of the dark. You can use either the shotgun or the wrench against them. When the lights come back on, head to the west. 
</p><p>Go into Dandy Dental and grab all the items you can find. Go north to a hallway with a tennis ball machine on one side and the Telekinesis Plasmid on the other.  Grab and equip the Telekinesis Plasmid. You can then practice catching and throwing things with the tennis ball machine. Using Telekinesis here does not use any Eve, so it's a great time to practice. 
</p><p>Make your way back to the entrance to the Surgery Wing. There will be a Nitro Splicer up on a balcony throwing bombs at you. Don't kill him, because you need him to remove the debris blocking the door. You're supposed to grab one of his bombs out of the air using Telekinesis and throw in at the debris. If you're having trouble with this, just stand next to the door. The splicer will aim for you and hit the door.
</p><p>Move through the Surgery Wing. You can find the Static Discharge gene tonic here.

<p>Keep going until you find Steinman giving a speech behind bulletproof glass. When he's done, he'll pull out a machine gun. You can get to him through the doors on either side of the glass.
</p><p>If you hit Steinman with Incinerate, he'll run for a pool located beneath the door you entered. There's also a health station here that he'll use to heal himself. 
</p><p>A better way to get him is to stun him with Electro Bolt, then fight him with the wrench. His machine gun isn't very effective at close range, and if you can push him into a corner, he won't run away and try to heal himself.
</p><p>Once you kill him, be sure to take his key. Make your way back through the level to toward the main area of the Medical Pavilion.
</p><p>The game will direct you to a scene where you encounter a dead Big Daddy, and a live Little Sister. You'll see a scene, and have to decide whether to harvest or rescue the Little Sister. If you harvest them, you'll gain more Adam immediately. If you rescue them, you'll get less. Tenenbaum (the woman on the balcony) promises that she'll make it worth your while if you rescue them. What she will actually do is give a bonus after every third sister you rescue. 
</p><p>If you rescue all of the little sisters, you'll get a different ending than if you kill all of them. The choice is up to you, but many players go through the game twice: once killing them and once saving them. You should decide now which you're going to do now; if you want the good ending, you'll have to save every Little Sister, including this one. 
</p><p>Once you've either harvested or rescued the little sister, head over to the Gatherer's Garden machine on the far end of the hall. Here you can use the Adam you've gathered purchase plasmid slots, plasmids, and gene tonics.
</p><p>The exit to this area will take you back to the Medical Pavilion. There will be a Big Daddy somewhere in this area. You'll want to gather up a lot of health and ammo before you try to take him out. You will want to defeat him and take the Little Sister's Adam before you go on to the next level.

<p>This level starts with a crucified smuggler and the corpse of a Big Daddy. Search the area for loot, and use the vending machine if you need anything. There is a second machine here called a Gene Bank. It's free to use, and lets you switch out your plasmids and gene tonics. 
</p><p>Move down the hall and you'll see a splicer jump through a hole in the ceiling. Don't bother going after it. This splicer is a new type: a Spider Splicer. 
</p><p>The next room is safe, but there's danger behind the next door. 
</p><p>There is a large open area with a two docks, one on each side. Under each dock is a machine gun turret, and there are several splicers in here. You could run through the door to your right, but you'll have to come back here anyway, so you might as well clear this room now. The best thing to do is head to the corner off to your right and go under the dock. Hack the turret here, then take out any splicers. You'll want to get the turret on the other side too. Spend some time under the dock looking for items.
</p><p>Once this area is secure, follow the directional arrow toward the fisheries. You'll have to deal with an RPG turret. In this area are a Gatherer's Garden, a health station, and a Circus of Values. 
</p><p>Follow the arrow and walk up to the door. Bang on it with your wrench to speak to Peach Wilkins. He'll ask you to find a camera and take three pictures of Spider Splicers.
</p><p>The camera is in the interrogation room, in the Warf Master's office. Head out of the fisheries, and go up the stairs. You'll have to fight your way through splicers and security cameras. 
</p><p>Once you've found the camera, you must find and photograph three Spider Splicers. 
</p><p>The first is really easy. There is a Spider Splicer in the room next to you, take the picture through the window. You'll gain bonuses when you've accumulated enough research, so you may as well take several pictures of him until you don't get research from subsequent pictures.  
</p><p>In the next room, on the ledge outside the window is the Security Bullseye Plasmid.
</p><p>Spider Splicer #2 in Jet Postal. Spider Splicers can be hard to see, be sure to check the walls and the ceilings. Note that taking a picture of the splicer after it is dead still counts. There is quite a bit of film here, so search for it.
</p><p>Spider Splicer #3 in the top floor of Fighting McDonagh bar, which is across from the post office. Check out all of the apartments there, and you'll find it.
</p><p>Before you go back to Fontaine Fisheries, make sure that you have plenty of Eve. Even if you don't usually use plasmids, you'll want plenty for this next section.
</p><p>Head back to Fontaine fisheries. Speak to Wilkins again, and he'll ask you to put your weapons in the pneumatic tube. You have to do as he says to continue. You'll get your weapons back in a little while. You'll have to make do with just your plasmids for now.

<p>In this area, you can use Incinerate to melt the ice you see and reveal items.
</p><p>You'll also have to deal with a bunch of other splicers and the security cameras. One of these splicers is Wilkins, but he's labeled as just another splicer. During the fight, some of the splicers drop pistols, so you can pick these up. 
</p><p>Grab your weapons from the pneumo tube. 
</p><p>Down the stairs you'll find a Power to the People weapon upgrade station. Don't upgrade the pistol, as it's already out of date. Try upgrading the shotgun or machine gun.
</p><p>You'll want to explore the rooms that branch off here for standard loot.
</p><p>To finish this level, go to the room on the east side of the bottom level. You'll see ghosts here. Melt the ice in one corner of this room to reveal a tunnel.

<p>Move down the tunnel, picking up whatever items you can. You'll need to crouch to get through some parts of the tunnel.
</p><p>You'll then come to a switch, and when you use it, an in-game scene will start. 
</p><p>You'll now have to fight your way through the next part of the hall to the exit. Although Atlas tells you to hurry, this section is not timed, and you can take as long as you like.

<a name="Arcadia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arcadia</span></h2>

<p>When you enter there is a secret room across the way. Find a torch on the wall, and next to it is an unlit torch. Light this second torch (use Incinerate) and a door will open. Go inside and grab the loot you find.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_Arcadia_torch_secret.jpg" class="image" title="Use Incinerate to light the other torch on fire."><img alt="Use Incinerate to light the other torch on fire." src="/images/thumb/4/4f/Bioshock_Arcadia_torch_secret.jpg/180px-Bioshock_Arcadia_torch_secret.jpg" width="180" height="135" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify" style="float:right"><a href="/index.php/Image:Bioshock_Arcadia_torch_secret.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>Use Incinerate to light the other torch on fire.</div></div></div>
<p>As you continue you'll encounter a splicer who asks you to follow him. He's leading you into an ambush. You can either ignore him, or fight through the ambush.
</p><p>You'll encounter a new type of splicer here, the Houdini Splicer. They shoot fire (like Incinerate) and teleport in combat.
</p><p>Part way to the metro station, Ryan will release poison gas that kills all the trees in Arcadia. You'll have to find a way to reverse the poison to continue. 
</p><p>Follow the directional arrow to the office of Julie Langford. She won't let you in, but she will ask you to find some components for the antidote. You'll have to get a Rosa Gallica specimen. 
</p><p>The specimen is located in the Waterfall Grotto. Go back to the Tree Farm and from there head southwest. The specimen is a large golden plant in the middle of the grotto. Of course you'll have to take out several turrets, and there are electric line traps in your way. 
</p><p>Head back to Langford's office. Put the sample in the pneumo tube. She'll let you into her office. When you get there, you'll see her get killed by Ryan's poison gas. Notice that she scrawls a number on the glass: 9457. Go into her office and use that code to open her safe. It's at the far end, behind the painting on the wall. Your new goal is to create the antidote to cure the trees, and to do it you'll need:
</p>
<ul><li>7 Chlorophyll 
</li><li>7 Bee Enzyme
</li><li>7 Distilled Water
</li></ul>
<p>Chlorophyll drops off Houdini Splicers and you should get enough of those in the course of finding the other two items. These other items can be found in the Farmer's Market.
</p><p>Watch out for the security system as you leave Langford's office. It is now active.
</p>
<a name="Farmer.27s_Market"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Farmer's Market</span></h2>

<p>Here you're looking for Bee Enzyme and Distilled water in order to create the Lazarus Vector, which will restore the trees in Arcadia. 
</p><p>These items are found throughout the level in small quantities, but there are two main places to go. 
</p><p>The bee enzyme is mostly found in the Apiary. The Apiary is found on the northwest side of the Farmer's Market. It's a storehouse of bee boxes, which hold the enzyme. Bees will attack you if you try to search the boxes, so use the smoker control near the door. The smoker control stops the bees from attacking, but it seals the exit and only lasts a minute or so. The smoke wears off just before the exit opens. Of course, each time you use it, you'll have to deal with a few splicers. 
</p><p>Distilled water you can get at the winery. The winery is just north of the Apiary. While you're there, be sure to use the weapon upgrade station in the cellar.
</p><p>Once you have the required items, head back to Arcadia.
</p>
<a name="Return_to_Arcadia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Arcadia</span></h2>
<p>Go to Langford's office. Here, use the U-Invent machine to create the vector. Then place it in the distribution machine. When you do, you'll only have a few moments before waves of splicers will attack. As soon as you've put the vector in the machine, run for the pneumo tube at the front of Langford's office. This was the place where you put the rose sample into the pneumo tube. It's also where you can shut security doors, and limit the number of splicers that attack you. You don't have to shut the doors, but it does help.
</p><p>Setting traps for the splicers helps. If you have the Hypnotize Big Daddy Plasmid, and you see a Big Daddy, now is the perfect time to use it.
</p><p>When you've finally fought off all the splicers, head to the metro station where you can take the bathysphere to the next level.
</p>
<a name="Fort_Frolic"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fort Frolic</span></h2>

<p>As you arrive at Fort Frolic, you'll hear Sander Cohen speaking to you on the radio. 
</p><p>Follow the arrow to the bathysphere. When you get there you'll find out that Cohen has locked the way to Hephaestus. You'll have to follow his instructions if you want to proceed. 
</p><p>First head toward Fleet Hall. You'll have to deal with several splicers on the way. 
</p><p>Here you'll see someone playing the piano, and Cohen will kill him.  Cohen will ask you to take a picture of this corpse, and then place the photo on his masterpiece at the bottom of the stairs in the main hall. As a reward, you'll get a crossbow. 
</p><p>You'll then have to find, kill, and photograph three more people.
</p><p>Martin Finnegan is a Houdini Splicer and uses cold attacks, so use fire against him. He is immune to cold damage. He's in the frozen tunnel. From the main hall, go upstairs and take the hall to the east. When you enter, he'll freeze you and talk a while before he attacks. After you kill him, be sure to loot his body for the Frozen Field gene tonic he drops.
</p><p>Hector Rodriguez is in Eve's XXX Garden. It's located through the frozen tunnel and all the way on the southeast side of the map. When you enter, you'll see a ghost stripper. Follow her to the back room where you'll find an important audio diary. When you leave this room, you'll find Rodriguez near the stage. He's a Nitro Splicer, but he'll run away from you. You'll have to chase him down.
</p><p>When you place Rodriguez's photo on the masterpiece, you'll be attacked by a large group of splicers.
</p><p>Silas Cobb is in the record shop. Despite what the in-game instructions say, don't wander around listening for music. The record shop is on the top level of Poesiden Plaza. To get there, go through the frozen tunnel, then head east into the Sir Prize casino. Take the elevator up one level, then exit and go west. 
</p><p>To get Cobb to appear, go to the lower level of the store. Here you'll find a corpse rigged with a bomb. When the bomb goes off, some Spider Splicers will attack you. Kill them all, then go out a small vent on the left side of the room facing the window. The vent will take you upstairs to where you can kill Cobb and take his photo. 
</p><p>When you place the final photo on the masterpiece, the lights go off and Cohen shows up. Do not attack him at this time. He unlocks a case containing the Medical Expert 2 plasmid. 
</p><p>Although you can kill him now, you'll miss out on a weapon upgrade later in the game. If you let him live, you will be able to find the secret room in his apartment in Olympus Heights. When you kill him in either spot, he will drop the key to a chest back in Fort Frolic.
</p><p>The locked case near Cohen's final gift is his "muse." Inside is some money, splicer hearts, and bolts. You won't find any tonics, weapons, or Adam inside. It can only be opened with a key Cohen drops, which you'll get when you kill him.
</p><p>If you tried looking upstairs behind the fleet hall and saw Cohen earlier on, you would have seen a bunch of loot behind a gate that was seemingly inaccessible. This is now open and contains a plasmid, an audio diary, and other decent goodies.
</p><p>Go to the bathysphere when you're ready to go to the next level.

<p>Head to the door of Ryan's apartment. Here you'll see some of Ryan's enemies that have been crucified. The room to the south has a gene tonic. The door is locked, and your new goal is to find a way to open it.
</p><p>Two of the corpses here have audio diaries that you should pick up to advance the story. When you do this Ryan will send a group of splicers to attack you. They have to cut through a door, so you'll have time to set up some defenses. You must now locate another audio diary.
</p><p>Head south through a long hallway. Some of the corpses here are actually splicers playing dead, and they are waiting to ambush you.
</p><p>Next you'll come to Hephestus's main ring. There is usually a Big Daddy patrolling around the ring. The Gatherer's Garden on the southwest side has Cyclone 2 and Electro Bolt 3 for sale.
</p><p>From the main ring, take the door on the south side. This takes you to Heat Loss Monitoring. Here you'll find an audio diary with the code to Kyburz's office (0126). You'll find another diary that tells you how to open Ryan's door: use the EMP bomb in the Lower Workshop.
</p><p>Head over to the workshop. To get there, go back to the main ring and take the exit on the east side. In the southwest corner of the lower workshop is a stack of crates. Hidden among them is a small passage way that leads to the EMP bomb. Pick up the audio diary here to get your next mission. The bomb is not yet complete, and requires several components: 
</p>
<ul><li>4 R-34 wires: found throughout the level on the corpses of Big Daddies. You can recheck corpses you've already looted. You may have to kill some Big Daddies to get them.
</li><li>2 quarter-cans of Ionic Gel: These are glowing bottles found all around the level. There are two located in the main ring, near the workshop door.
</li><li>Nitroglycerin: found inside Kyburz's Office
</li></ul>

<p>Kyburz's Office, is in the workshop area. The room is filled with trap bolts, so either shoot them out with the revolver, or use Telekinesis to remove them. There is a button on the side of the desk that opens the glass and lets you access the Nitroglycerin. Don't forget to use the Power to the People weapon upgrade station here. 
</p><p>Go back to the bomb, and place the components inside. Now take the bomb to the Geothermal Control. The entrance is located off the west side of the main ring. Hack, do not destroy, the turrets you find there. You'll need them for later.
</p><p>If you have the Cyclone Plasmid, you may want to equip it now. There is a gene bank just outside the door. There is also a U-invent Machine there, if you want to make some trap bolts. 
</p><p>You'll have to redirect the magma flow. While this happens, you'll have to defend the area, so listen to Atlas's advice and set up a perimeter. Use trap bolts, proximity mines and your Cyclone Plasmid. There are only two doors, so you can easily concentrate your defenses.
</p><p>You must hold down the use button while the valve moves. It takes about a minute. Once you've redirected the magma flow, you can take the elevator behind you down one level. Move forward and you'll find a gene tonic. Keep going forward and use the bomb.
</p><p>Now head back to Ryan's office.

<p>Head towards Ryan's apartment. You'll have to go up the elevator. When you get to the main room, wait for the lights to come on, then head up the stairs. On this upper level, you'll find a crawl space through a dark hallway.
</p><p>Watch the scene with Ryan. You have no real control during this section. You cannot choose whether or not to kill Ryan. 
</p><p>When he's dead, grab his control key and place it in the large machine nearby. You'll then be attacked by splicers. Follow the little sister to the end of the level.

<p>As this level starts, you'll be at Tenenbaum's safehouse. Even if you've been killing Little Sisters, Tenenbaum will still help you.
</p><p>One of the Little Sisters will open the door for you and let you out. Atlas's mind control has been broken, but he still has the ability to slowly drain your health. You must find two antidotes. 
</p><p>First you have to get out of the sewers. Find the glowing gold wheel, and use it to open the gate. Exit the sewers and head north to Mercury Suites.
</p><p>On the way you'll pass a restaurant that's been gutted and barricaded. In the west section you'll find a Gatherer's Garden which sells some new Plasmids and Gene Tonics: Armored Shell 2, Speedy Hacker 2, Incinerate 3, Winter's Blast 3, and Insect Swarm 3. The east section a door that will take you to Apollo Square.
</p><p>In the Mercury Suites main courtyard are several splicers, a security camera, and a Big Daddy patrol route. The good news is there is also a Power to the People weapon upgrade station located on the ground floor.
</p><p>Go to Tenenbaum's apartment. It's on the east side of the upper floor. Don't take the elevator, use the stairs that wrap around the elevator shaft. You'll have to go through a hole in the wall to get into the apartment. Search the apartment and you'll find the Clever Inventor gene tonic. You'll also get a message from Tenembaum saying that the antidote is in Fontaine's apartment.

</p><p>On the ground floor, go to the elevator in the center of the courtyard and take the elevator up. The elevator code is 5744.
</p><p>The entrance to his apartment is a Zen garden. It has several splicers and a security camera.
</p><p>Search the apartment, but watch out for the security turrets. The antidote is in the northeast side of the apartment. 
</p><p>When you take this antidote, you'll loose control of your plasmid abilities. You'll be able to use only one at a time, and you won't be able to pick which one. Either learn to use the plasmid available, or rely on your weapons.
</p><p>The second antidote is located in Apollo Square, in Suchong's Lab.
</p><p>There are a few things you might want to do in this area. You can do them now, or come back after you've gotten the second dose of antidote.
</p><p>Cohen's apartment is on the east side of the courtyard, ground floor.  If you didn't kill him earlier, you can do it now. Enter his apartment, and you'll see two splicers dancing. Both are Houdini Splicers, and if you don't kill them with your first volley they'll use deadly hit and run tactics against you. Once both are dead Cohen will attack you. He is also a Houdini Splicer. You can take a picture of his body for the gamerscore achievement. You'll also get another achievement for finding his secret area. He drops a key that unlock a chest in Fort Frolic, but there's nothing really valuable in it.

<p>You're looking for Suchong's lab, where the second dose of antidote is kept.
</p><p>Once the Apollo Square level loads, head down the passage and stay to the right. This will lead you to Artemis Square. It's at the northeast corner of the map. Suchong's Lab is located on the second floor. The sign next to the door reads "Free Clinic."
</p><p>Once you have the antidote, you can move on to the bathysphere station and the next level, or you can explore this area some more. 
</p><p>You'll want to visit the Power to the People weapon upgrade station. It's located on the far south side of the map, in Hestia. Also be sure to get both Little Sisters on this level.

<p>The level starts with you chasing Fontaine. You can't catch him yet, but keep moving forward. He hides behind a door that only a Little Sister can open. You'll have to dress as a Big Daddy and get a Little Sister to open it.
</p><p>Goal: Become a Big Daddy
</p>
<ul><li>Get 3 Pheromone Samples from the Little Wonders educational facility. The entrance to the facility on the bottom floor is locked. To get there, go to the Atrium Balcony and go down stairs. 
</li><li>Get the Big Daddy Helmet and the Big Daddy Bodysuit from Failsafe Armored Escorts
</li><li>Get the Big Daddy Boots from the Mendel Family Library
</li><li>Get the Suit Control Unit from one of the Big Daddy corpses scattered through the level
</li><li>and use the Larynx Modification Machine from Optimized Eugenics
</li></ul>

<p>Complete this level by going to the Little Sister Port and hitting it with your wrench while wearing the Big Daddy suit.

<p>In this section, you'll be escorting a little sister. If the little sister dies, you'll get a new one, and there isn't a penalty. You'll still be able to get the "good" ending for saving all of the little sisters.  
</p><p>Before you start this section you'll want a few items. Stock up on explosive and anti-personnel ammo of all types. You'll also want proximity mines and trap bolts. Go to a U-Invent Machine and grab autohack tools for turrets and security system. Head over to the gene bank and equip the Cyclone and Static Discharge Plasmids.   
</p><p>When you're ready, use your wrench and bang on the little sister portal. A little sister will come out, and you'll have to follow her. Most of the escort will happen in a hallway. The little sister will walk up to three different corpses and gather Adam. You'll have to protect her while she does. Use anti-personnel and exploding ammo to take out the splicers more quickly. Winter's Chill is very effective here. Trap bolts, proximity mines and cyclones are very effective here, because splicers can only come from two directions. 
</p><p>Hack all the cameras and turrets you find. Because your a big daddy, they won't fire on you, but they will go after your Little Sister. 
</p><p>Your weapons won't hurt the Little Sister, so you can use any weapon you like, even if the target is right next to her.
</p><p>Ignore the ammo and items here, you will be able to come back to this area and loot at your leisure.
</p><p>She'll eventually take you out of the hall and into a museum. Here you'll have to fight a Big Daddy. 
</p><p>At the end of the escort, you'll get a Little Sister syringe. You'll use this in the boss fight coming up.
</p>
<a name="Final_Boss_Battle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Final Boss Battle</span></h2>
<p>This is the final battle of the game. There are no vita chambers here, so save your game before you go in. 
</p><p>Before you get to the boss himself, use the Gene Bank to make sure your plasmids and tonics are in order. He uses elemental attacks, so Electric Flesh, Frozen Field, and Human Inferno will be helpful. Be sure to remove photographer's eye and research damage if you still have them equipped. Also worthless for this fight are Hypnotize Big Daddy, Scrounger, and Security Bullseye. Cyclone and Enrage are nearly worthless.
</p><p>When you enter the room of the battle, you'll see Atlas in some sort of a chamber. Walk up to him and use the needle gun to drain his Adam. This will cause him to break free and attack you. 
</p><p>You'll have to defeat him three times. After each time you defeat him, you have to run up to him in his chamber and drain his Adam. Each time he'll use a different type of attack. The first time he'll use fire attacks. The second time he'll use electrical and the last time cold. Do not try to attack him with the same type of attack he's using against you.
</p><p>Keep moving to dodge his attacks. The grenade launcher with RPG rounds in a good weapon to use against him. The chemical thrower is also good. Just keep in mind which elemental phase he's in, and don't use that type of ammo. 
</p><p>There is a health station located here, behind the chamber. This is your last chance to use auto hack tools. It's also your last chance to spend money in the game.
</p><p>After you've defeated him for the third time, the little sisters will show up and the game will be over. You will now watch the ending you earned, depending on whether or not you killed the little sisters.
