  Well i just downloaded and installed Battlefield 2152 demo, i managed to get ok playable performance with all settings maxed out at 1280x960, but with AA turned off.<br /><br />Of course it runs ok, but i want to get even more good performance and graphics, would an upgrade from 2.2ghz processors to 3ghz have any significant improvment on performance? or do i really need a better graphic card than XFX geForce 7800GS Extreme Edition Agp?

The game is not very cpu heavy at all, more so in single player mode. The graphic card is stressed a little more but the game seems to be farly optimized. Try setting res to 1024x768 and enable 2xAA. This wil give you better fps and also set shadows and lighting to medium, also try turning post processing on and off to see the difference. What does make the game MUCH smoother is 2GIG of memort, this will get rid of the jittery load type stuttering. Also, if you have a on board soundcard make (ac97) set sound hardware to off snd medium, not high. Try this and let me know how you get on.

  The 7800GS isnt a high end card, you probably wont be able to run it at high settings on Battlefield 2142 with maximum AA. The 7800GS Agp standard performs about 25% slower than the 7800GT PCI-express that was released nearly 18 months ago. Its a good card but it wont be able to play new games maxed out seeing as how its 25% slower than the older 7800GT. There is faster 7800GS+  cards out there with 24 pipes (7900 series core) and 512mb ram but not worth the  money to plough into an AGP system. A new Cpu will help but you will still be bottlenecked by your 7800GS.

  that really does suck, considering AGP hasent reached its full potential from the looks of it, i get the same benchmark results on this system comparble to ppl with similar setup but with a 8x slot, while i only have a 4x one.<br /><br />i suppose nobody knows of any motherboard that supports PCI-E 16x, AGP and RDRAM and 603 slot processors <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/tongue.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":P" border="0" alt="tongue.gif" />

  Using a 7800GS in either a x4 or x8 Agp slot wont affect performance at all. The 7800GS bandwidth requirements dont exceed what a x4 Agp slot can deliver , in short there will be no difference in performance between both as the 7800GS doesnt saturate a x4 Agp bus. PCI-E cards have been making headway for 2 years now, thats a long time and cards like the 7800GS Agp are extremley overpriced considering the performance they give out compared to PCI-E gfx cards. I guess they knew people would still buy them despite the PCIE offering much more performance for a lesser amount of money. I believe its far cheaper in the long run to upgrade to the pcie platform rather than throw money at legacy AGP platforms were you get far far less performance for the price you pay.<br /><br />Heres a quick example, a 7800GS standard 256mb AGP costs around �190, you can buy a 7950GT 512mb PCIE 24 pipe card for the same price. You are looking at a seriously massive perf lead the 7950GT has and all for approx same price. Even cards like the 7900GS 256mb PCI-E will outperform the 7800GS Agp significantly and for around �80 less. They arent worth the cash but of course some people dont want to upgrade their platform but it costs more in the long run with far less perf.

  actually what i was referring to, is that they dont seem to make AGP cards that take full advantage of an AGP8x bus, its faster, yet the graphic cards that take advantage of it havent been made <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/sad.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":(" border="0" alt="sad.gif" />

  hmmm actually, after another go at it, i actually get pretty decent playable framerate at 1600x1200 screen resolution, all sliders and AA to max. but then again im not using a simple 7800GS im using a 7800GS extreme edition <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/wink.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=";)" border="0" alt="wink.gif" /><br />Its not the very best framerate but its still playable  <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" />

  The extreme versions only have faster clock speeds, it still doesnt make up for the 7800GS+ cards having better cores, the 7800GS extreme edition only has 16 pipes with faster clocks than the normal 7800GS. The 7800GS+ models have 20 pipes and the top of the line 7800GS+ has the 7900 core fully enabled, 24 pipes.<br /><br />How did you manage to go from posting your &#39;ok&#39; playable performance at 1280x960 with no AA to 1600x1200 max settings with 4xAA? Seems like an impossible jump in perf, maybe you should post your screenshots of 3dmark05 and 06 with the default settings showing and we can see how the card performs <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" />

Should be roughly 2x3DMark06. You get about what the most 7800GS show in 3DMark06. I doubt you get smooth BF2142 performance at max settings with that set-up.

  30fps average isnt playable for a fast fps like B2142, you need at least 45fps+ to play it properly for a decent experience, 50fps+ for some ownage. 30fps is awful for a twitcher like B2142, be surprised if you manage to pop anyone with those fps <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" /> At 20-25fps like you say you experience a lot the game isnt worth even beginning to play. Only games that you can play properly at those kind of fps are slow paced games like Oblivian.

  naturally, you have a comp that scores over 10k on 3dmark06 while mine just barley makes it over 3k <br /><br />however, i naturally strive for the best performance possible. actually i generally play FEAR on all settings maxed, 1280x960 screen resolution, FSAA turned off and soft shadows off. the 12-15 fps was when i had everything blown up to max  <img src="http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/haha.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":haha:" border="0" alt="haha.gif" />

  You think that&#39;s bad&#33; I&#39;m getting horrible performance while playing BF2142&#33;<br /><br /><br />I think it&#39;s the 1.06 patch that messed it up&#33; I&#39;m now getting 10-15 FPS while in the titan, 40fps if I&#39;m lucky outside. Before I was getting 80-100fps, no matter where I was in the game. Game was at max everything, no problems. Now with 1.06 it&#39;s not really playable, I have to disable SLI to get better FPS and turn off AA and AF set to 8x. So I can see about 40FPS at all times&#33;<br /><br />Anyone know of a way to fix this????<br />Specs in sig.<br /><br />Thank you
