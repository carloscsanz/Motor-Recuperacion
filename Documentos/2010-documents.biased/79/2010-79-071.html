i tried ASPack 2.11 but it just produces crap...<br />
UXPacker also won't work !<br />
Any help is appreciated !  :rolleyes: <br />
muji !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caki</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 12:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Try CEXE. Its **** when it comes to protecting, but for compression its cool enough. You can find it at:<br />

But the website you told me wants to have a login name and password  :confused: <br />
Isn't it public ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muji-FightR</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 10:28</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't even start !  :confused: <br />
I downloaded it from that link but it won't open !<br />
So i ran it in a Win95 compatible mode (&quot;Kompatibit√§tsmodus&quot; in German) and it finally starts but it sais not compatible with Win98 &amp; 95 ???!!!<br />
I made it Win2000 compatible but it doesn't start !<br />
What shall i do ?<br />
<br />
i tried plenty of packers (ASPack, UXPacker, Petite, 20to4, ...) but none of them works...<br />
Petite said &quot;Cannot pack this exe file&quot;, ASPack has packed it but the result was a damaged .exe fiel which didn't work... <br />
Please help me !  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muji-FightR</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 12:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is: Does it also work with c# files ?<br />
It will probably work for C, C++, VB, ... but i don't know if it will compress C# coded exe files... ?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DABhand</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">What you fail to realise is this.<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter what language a program file was before, it is compiled into machine code the computer understands.<br />
<br />
So any packing/wrapper will work.<br />
<br />
You may have used the wrong syntax to pack the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With C# and VB.net files the code is compiled into Microsoft Intermediate Language. Then, once you run the exe a Just in Time compiler will compile the<br />
Microsoft Intermediate Language code into native code and then execute it. Also, I think that the Just In Time compiler also checks the PE header to see if it has been changed, because if you change the PE header, the exe wont run. Since most exe packers change the PE header, the exe will not be able to run because the JIT detects these changes and wont run. CEXE packed exes, however, when unpacked do not have any changes in the PE header, thereby allowing the packed VB.net exe or C# exe to run.</div></div><hr />

That's why I asked for a special c# packer...Because it is &quot;precompiled&quot; and has to be compiled by a Just-In-Time compiler (&quot;Jitter&quot;) it cannot be packed like normal exe files<br />
The jitter will probably not compile a strange exe file without a valid pe header !<br />
My problem is CEXE doesn't work for me  :confused: <br />
It won't start with my winXP and in Win95 combatible mode it will, but there is the little sentence &quot;does not work with Windows 95 &amp; 98&quot; ??!!<br />
What shall I do? Is there another packer that works for C# files ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caki</div><div class="date">07-08-2005, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, there is if you wanna pay 300$  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The exe will call on API's that is used via either C# or VB.net. Unless they were stated to be included with the exe, which they never do to reduce sizes.<br />
<br />
Hence why most c# or VB proggies require runtime files etc to make em work.<br />
<br />
But the initial exe is encoded to a general language that the comp understands.<br />
<br />
The only reason that Muji is having problems is that possibly the compiler, wrapped the exe for him already.</div></div><hr />

At first i want to thank you guys for your support and feedback !  :) <br />
@DABHand:<br />
Does this mean the file is already packed while compiling ? I get a result of 200kb merged to 90 kb with ASPack ?! That's why i thought it could be packed again (it finally didn't start but hey, it was a 60% smaller :/ )...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caki</div><div class="date">08-08-2005, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the Jitter is acting as a wrapper in this case, preventing muji from packing the file. Thats why I suggested cexe. I have used it in the past to compress vb.net exes. Cexe decompresses the exe onto the hard drive and then runs it, making no changes to the intial exe, while other packers change the PE header, making the Jitter not want to run due to an invalid checksum, crc, or whatever on the PE header.<br />
<br />
BTW muji, try dling cexe from here:<br />
http://protools.cjb.net/<br />
<br />
I dled from there and packed a custom c# prog I made. It worked fine, so it should also work for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cdkiller</div><div class="date">10-08-2005, 10:34</div></div><div class="posttext">i suggest UPack v0.30 it got a very high compression ratio.<br />
http://dwing.go.nease.net/<br />
<br />
easy to unpack but you asked for a good compression ratio for pe files ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muji-FightR</div><div class="date">18-08-2005, 11:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Oh Oh !<br />
It took about 2 weeks to notice that CEXE only works with cmd line  :o <br />
How stupid am I ?  :D <br />
Now it finally works good, got a 115 kb file (before 230). the only problem is, it doesn't restart (my prog). There is an option &quot;restart program&quot; but it will not work  :confused:  Not very bad, at least it works quite good your program !<br />
<br />
Very big thanks for your help  ;) <br />
<br />
cheers muJi</div></div><hr />
