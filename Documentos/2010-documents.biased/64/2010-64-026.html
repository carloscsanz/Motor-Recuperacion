<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4526" title="civilunrest_reuters1" src="http://www.shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/civilunrest_reuters1.jpg" alt="civilunrest_reuters1" width="480" height="341" /><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>The beginning of civil unrest and <a href="http://www.ireport.com/blogs/ireport-blog/2010/02/18/austin-attack-stuns-community" target="_blank"> social uprising in the United States of America reared it&#8217;s head</a> and showed us the shape of things to come as social order comes unraveled as a result of the financial collapse and ravaging of the nation [looting the burning mansion model] well on it&#8217;s way into 3rd world status.</p>
<p>The heaviness in the air and the lateness of the hour causes myself no surprises in such events as the plane crash in Austin, TX is just an example of what to expect in the coming days, weeks, and months from a nation of people being urinated on and raped by a group of international banksters that hold absolutely no allegiance to anyone or anything. There is much speculation on if this was a patsy, a ploy, a pissed off American, a patriot, or just a false flag staged by the government. I strongly feel that this is just the beginning of some <strong><em>seriously tough times</em></strong> ahead.</p>
<p>Many people are going to be devastated financially as the wave of foreclosures, bankruptcies, job lay-offs/losses, and destruction of the currency unwinds. <a href="http://www.thecomingdepression.net/main-street/bankruptcy-main-street/detroit-inkstop-closes-all-stores-workers-stunned/" target="_blank"> I see alot of employers not being able to pay their employees&#8217; payroll coming soon as well just like with the chain store Ink Stop</a>. When all of the public services can no longer be funded, states go bankrupt, welfare ceases, un-employment no longer available, electricity turned off, food to expensive or just not available, and the toilet no longer able to flush; you can guarantee that social order cannot and will not be maintained. I am pretty sure you are smart enough to figure that one out, but also think of all of the firearms on the streets and owned by private citizens in this country. <em> Just 2 days ago I was working out front when a customer got out of his car and his pistol fell onto the ground in plain sight. I am not trying being rude, but this was not exactly a model citizen that dropped his pistol. This is just a little more proof that social order cannot be maintained in the future.</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a few aspects and quotes especially starting with Zbigniew Brzezinski:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22369.htm" target="_blank"> [source of below]</a></p>
<p><a href="http://bariumblues.com/brzezinski.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Zbigniew Brzezinski</strong></a>, former National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter and an early supporter of Barack Obama have the last word. The US is &#8220;going to have millions and millions of unemployed people really facing dire straits. And we&#8217;re going to be having that for some period of time before things hopefully improve. And at the same time there&#8217;s public awareness of this extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few individuals at levels without historical precedent in America&#8230; hell there could even be riots .&#8221;</p>
<p>In Brzezinski&#8217;s book <strong><em>Between Two Ages</em></strong>, he lays out 2 visions on page 300:</p>
<ol>
<li> A universal monetary unit that would replace the US Dollar as the reserve currency of the world;</li>
<li> A decline in the standard of living in order to achieve it [just as stated above]</li>
</ol>
<p>It would also be wise to look at Igor Panarnin&#8217;s predictions for the United States as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22369.htm" target="_blank"> [source of below]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Then there is Professor Igor Nikolavich Panarin whom I came across in a December 2008 article by Andrew Osborne of the Wall Street Journal no less, not some fly-by-night rag. If he has got it right, next year will come to be known as &#8216;The Collapse of 2010&#8242; for that is when the USA will disintegrate into six separate entities. Those six entities, says Prof Panarin, are The California Republic, The Central North American Republic, Atlantic America, The Texas Republic, Hawaii and Alaska going back to Russia.</p>
<p>With millions of Chinese living on America&#8217;s eastern seaboard (The People&#8217;s Daily&#8217;s circulation there alone is over five million) The California Republic, Prof Panarin thinks, will either be part of China or come under Chinese influence. The Central North American Republic will be part of Canada or under Canadian influence, Atlantic America may join the European Union, The Texas Republic will be part of Mexico or under Mexican influence and Hawaii will go either to Japan or China.</p>
<p>Prof Panarin is a former KGB analyst and a Russian professor of political science, Dean of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs Diplomatic Academy in Moscow and author of several books on geopolitics. Thus one can hardly call him a fruitcake. Actually, he first made this prediction not after the economic meltdown that started last year but in Linz, Austria, in September 1998 in front of 400 delegates at a conference devoted to information warfare and the use of data to get an edge over a rival. Of course it was received with consternation. &#8220;When I pushed the button on my computer and the map of the United States disintegrated, hundreds of people cried out in surprise,&#8221; he says. Later, many delegates asked him to sign copies of the map. Its like when the French political scientist Emmanuel Todd made his famous forecast in 1976 about the collapse of the Soviet Union 15 years before it actually did and many people laughed. But Todd had the last laugh.</p>
<p>Prof Panarin doesn&#8217;t say that America&#8217;s collapse is a forgone conclusion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a 55-45 percent chance right now that disintegration will occur,&#8221; he says. But if it comes it will be driven by three factors - &#8220;mass immigration, economic decline and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar. Around the end of June 2010, or early July, he says, the US will break into six pieces&#8230;He predicts that economic, financial and demographic trends will provoke a political and social crisis in the US. When the going gets tough, he says, wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government and effectively secede from the Union. Social unrest up to and including a civil war will follow. The US will then split along ethnic lines, and foreign powers will move in.&#8221; All we Pakistanis thus have to do is hang in there and soon America will not be meddling in our affairs any more, what to talk of General Patraeus&#8217;s adviser David Kilcullen saying that Pakistan could fall apart in five or six months.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to comprehend the collapse of an empire or a superpower. When termites are eating away at their vitals for years one cannot see it. People are too much in thrall of their power, wealth and panoply. Thus when the collapse comes it seems sudden, and takes people by surprise. &#8220;I went to sleep last night and when I woke up next morning the Soviet Union was gone.&#8221; The most powerful war machine ever built couldn&#8217;t save it. Remember the British Empire on which &#8220;the sun would never set&#8221;? It set so firmly that only six decades later Britain is not only bankrupt, it has become America&#8217;s appendage, a third rate power and could itself disintegrate soon with Scotland seceding. The history of the world is replete with the demise of civilisations, empires and superpowers. The graveyards of nations are full of their bones.</p>
<p>That there may be something to what Prof Panarin says is borne out by the fact that the late Bush Administration made contingency plans to impose martial law in case of economic collapse or massive and violent social unrest with blood on the streets. His predictions seem plausible, even probable, if all the dire scenarios come right, as they have thus far. According to Rand Clifford the US has already made plans to &#8220;round up insurgent US citizens&#8221; and detain them in what are called &#8220;Rex 84&#8243; camps. Plus they have made &#8220;safe facilities&#8221; for members of Congress and their families. A report by the Phoenix Business Journal says: &#8220;A new report by the US Army and War College talks about the possibility of Pentagon resources and troops being used should the economic crisis lead to civil unrest, such as protests against businesses and government or runs on beleaguered banks.&#8221; The Journal&#8217;s story quote from the War College report: &#8220;Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defence establishment to reorient priorities in extremist to defend basic domestic order and human security.&#8221; It needs saying that the military regularly makes plans for the most dire of situations, however seemingly unlikely.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like the termite analogy. Very appropriate. It may be that the unraveling is much closer than any of us think, it&#8217;s just that we see very little evidence of it to date.</p>
<p>Although 4-5 banks are being closed every Friday, it&#8217;s important to note that more than 500 alone close in 1992. So unless things are really not what they seem, we have a ways to go before the banking system really starts to implode.</p>
<p>But there are increasing warning signs every day. Just yesterday we learn that Citibank sent a warning to its bank customers that they reserve the right to withhold funds in depositors bank accounts for up to 7 days should customers require withdrawal (they later said it was a mistake as the letter was only intended for its Texas branches - why Texas?). Then the SEC (or before this?) allowed money market funds do suspend redemptions should another market meltdown occur.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next? Forced conversion of 401(k) and/or pensions into government backed annuities? Bob Chapman fears this may actually happen.</p>

<p>As Gerald Celente has so aptly put it &#8220;when people loose everything , thay loose it !&#8221;Â  I would like to point out to the author the campus riots of the 60sÂ andÂ Â the cityÂ riotsÂ across the countryÂ as well . Both were defining moments of our times . so civil unrest is not as uncommon as he wants us to beleave .Â  Having worked for a large credit union for over 12 years some time ago , I can attest to the fact that the fastest way to enrage someone is to seperate them from thier money ! A bank Holiday would be a desaster in more ways than one .</p>

<p>The Austin plane crash just did not register in the media here in the UK. Granted, the more serious elements of the media are somewhat preoccupied by the fiscal crisis in Greece and the other Club Med countries and a growing realisation that the UK is in deep shite. But, you&#8217;d have thought the more perceptive commentators over here would have picked up on it and started to realise that things are unravelling in a pretty serious way. Then again, apart from a handful of commentators, most of them are just trying to pull the wool over people&#8217;s eyes. Which means looking out for alternative news sources, engaging the brain and working out for ourselves what&#8217;s going on&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course he was killed intentionallyâ¦The only question is why do it in such a public fashion against a Federal Building? Because TPB need to justify the deployment of foreign soliders on our soil.<br />

Economic depression &amp; social unrest wonât do the trick. However, you throw in a few fanatical citizen attacks against our government, then they can fully âjustifyâ the defense of their infrastructure &amp; employees with troops. Expect more of these âPatriotâ attacks soon.<br />

<p>YD, I almost posted that story from Sorcha Faal regarding the Brigades of NATO troops (18,000 according to Faal), but I was unable to verify this through the Russian GRU or the German Defense Ministry last night. Perhaps Faal has some insider info we are not yet aware of and I will post the info as soon as I can verify a legitimate source.</p>
<p>Still, you are correct about foreign troops in general, as there has been an inflow of troops from other countries into the US for quite some time, so I will not deny that Faal is on to something here.</p>

<p>Mac-<br />
Of course you must (try to verify through official sources), and we appreciate your due diligence.Â <br />
However, the nature and sensitivity of this information makes that highly unlikely.<br />
Logically speaking, the folks on this boardÂ share the common ground that the S will HTF.Â  When that scenario unfolds, do any of usÂ truly believe American soliders will have the stomach to police their own?Â Â  I know I couldn&#8217;t.Â Â Â  S.F. might be a loon, but on its face, this story passes muster.<br />
PeaceÂ Â </p>
