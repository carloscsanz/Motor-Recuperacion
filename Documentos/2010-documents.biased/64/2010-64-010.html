<p align="justify">Few motherboard manufacturers pack features like Gigabyte does, especially for a mATX motherboard. Of course, we would definitely want to have our cake and eat it too, so we don't expect anything less from Gigabyte when it comes to raw performance. That is why we pitted it against fiercer competition, the Asus P5WD2 Premium based around the i955 chipset.

<p align="center"><em>The cute lady on our testbed.</em></p><p><strong><span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Technologies That Makes A Difference</span></strong></p><p align="justify">This Gigabyte seemed to have subtle differences from the rest of its ilk, but we did not have any idea what they were until we scrutinised the packaging. Amongst the familiar logos printed on the box, Intel<sup>®</sup> Viiv™ and RoHS certification was new to us.</p>

<p align="justify">For 2006, RoHS and Viiv™ is definitely going to become commonplace for PC hardware, at least that is what we know from the whispers-and-jitters we sensed. Since that is the case, why don't we take a look at what Viiv™ and RoHS has to offer?</p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">Restriction Of Certain Hazardous Substances</font></p>

<p align="justify">Restriction Of Ceratin Hazardous Substances, or RoHS for short, is a EU directive that has been around for a good while. It principally deals with bans on heavy metals like lead that is used in solder. Solder is basically the ultimate electronics "glue" that sticks tiny electronic components on the printed circuit board and double as an electrically conductive path that completes the circuit.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/./gallery_cache/082196a738a340ed6dbf34a630016a5a.jpg" onerror="ImgErr(this)" CUSTOM_TAG="http://resources.vr-zone.com/yantronic/GA-8I945GMH-RH/rohs.jpg"/></p>

<p align="justify">Since traditional solder is an alloy of lead and tin, it is pretty much ruled out for use in today's modern consumer electronics. Therefore for the sake of our environment (think cute little cuddly animals we city-dwellers don't get to see, living in some part of the world we cannot pronounce accurately without reinstalling our toungues), our future generations (think cute cuddly little geek-kids who wield soldering irons like Jedis wield light sabers), our health (lead poisoning for humans is the equivalent to the successful reversal of the ATX connector to a motherboard) and ourselves (perpetual addicts of smoking soldering irons and LN2), and it should become clear why RoHS is important.</p>

<p align="justify">For now, Tin/Silver/Copper (Sn/Ag/Cu) solder is on its journey to take over old school 60/40 solder. The magic ratio I learnt to love is no longer relevant today, as you can see in the newer batches of PC hardware, such as the Asus "green" motherboards and the Built-By-ATi X1000 series of graphics accelerators. VRM components by the likes of Intersil are also available in lead-free packages to aid the lead-free wave soldering process. Analysts expect nearly all consumer electronics to comply with RoHS guidelines by the end of 2006.</p>

<p align="justify">Along with RoHS is the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) guidelines that does pretty much the same thing as RoHS where PC hardware is concerned. It is therefore expected that future consumer electronic products will be lead-free as legislation defines. Connection integrity should not be a problem at all for RoHS compliant PC hardware, with manufacturers ensuring that lead-free solder does not get contaminated by lead traces.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">Intel<sup>®</sup> Viiv ™</font></p><br>

<p align="justify">Intel<sup>®</sup> has a whole bunch of press releases for their Viiv™ . You can take your time and read it <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20051130corp.htm" target="_blank">here</a> but since it is not quite the most exciting thing to do, we would just do a little summary on it for you, our dear readers. :)</p>

<p align="justify">Intel<sup>®</sup> Viiv™ is a whole new concept that addresses everything from user-friendliness of media devices, to Digital Rights Management by taking care of Intellectual Property. It is supposed to be multiplatform therefore encompassing everything from hardware to software IDs and more to come. Thanks to the sheer industry-moving ability of Intel<sup>®</sup> , it is hoped that a feasible and unified approach towards content management can be improved by Viiv™ . Below is what you would come across as the immediate benefits of Viiv™ , as modelled by Intel<sup>®</sup> .</p>

<p align="justify">When comparing our motherboards, we understand that many motherboard makers do speed-bump their products by a certain margin. We would often see BIOS FSB values not corresponding to that of what is detected by hardware detection engines, for example, in CPU-Z. We are not faulting any of these manufacturers for helping end-users get performance gains out-of-the-box, but of course, it still boils down to a grey-area where integrity is concerned. It is therefore fairer to our readers that we present benchmark scores with the same settings inside-out, rather than base things upon just "Optimised Defaults."</p>

<p align="justify">Knowing that many of you would want to know why the benchmarks were chosen, here is a rough idea:</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>3DMark2001SE</strong>: <em>In the days when Futuremark was MadOnion.com, 3DMark2001SE was everyone's favourite DirectX 7 benchmark. Frenzied overclockers tried out the program and ran benchmarks staggered at multiple different clockspeeds to rule the Online Result Browser's Hall Of Fame. Now that graphics accelerators are so much more advanced, we see 3DMark2001SE as a 3D benchmark with heavy reliance on system power (CPU, memory bandwidth, PCIe bandwidth etc.) It is a very sensitive benchmark today, and therefore we are using it to magnify performance differences amongst candidates.</em></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>3DMark05</strong>: <em>You can't deny that Futuremark's 3DMark05 created another generation of benchmarking addicts. Using large textures and heavy details, it is a very beautiful DirectX 9.0 benchmark. It tends to be pretty graphically dependent when graphics accelerators lack punch, or when the PCIe buss can't move the textures fast enough. It is reflective of the type of stress current games throw at your PC system.</em></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>FEAR</strong>: <em>Rated by many gaming sites as the best single-player of 2005, FEAR should not be alien to our readers at all. We use the benchmarking function integrated into the game to test out the ability of the system to calculate bot action and game physics.</em></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Half-Life 2: Lost Coast</strong>: <em>HL2's debut in 2004 caused a stir amongst single-player deprived gamers who have been rotting away while waiting for the stale gaming industry to give them something new. Using the Source Engine, physics are about as realistic as it gets and graphics are about as natural as current generation of games are concerned. Throw in a sequel to the orignal HL2 with pretty HDR lighting effects and some head-cracking to get around, you get Lost Coast. Be forewarned that this game is extemely system power limited. Using a custom timedemo we created, we can benchmark a system's bit-crunching abilities.</em></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Quake 4</strong>: <em>Based upon the Doom 3 game engine, Quake 4 is probably the most stressful Open GL game around at the moment.

<p align="center"><em>With our custom timedemo we found Quake 4 unplayable on the GMA950 at any rate. Looks like OpenGL may be a no-go for GMA950.</em></p>

<p align="justify">We had problems navigating Half Life 2: Lost Coast's menu, so that basically shook off our hope of benchmarking it at any rate. Unless you are living on a primary diet of Worms and Gunbound, or Pangya and DoTA, gamers should look towards using a discrete graphics accelerator. The last straw has to be the lack of load-sharing from the CPU in HD Video (H.264) decoding.</p><p><strong><span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Conclusion: WOOT OR MOOT?</span></strong></p><p align="left"><font size="5">Stability</font></p>

<p align="justify">Benchmarking, as we all know, is particularly stressful to hardware, and it is only under such conditions do we normally encounter traces of instability.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout the benchmarks we ran, we did not encounter any problems, except in 3DMark06 and PCMark05. In case you were wondering why these two benchmarks were excluded, Windows blue-screens on us whenever the System Scan initiates for these two benchmarks. We did not encounter any other problems whatsoever during the month-long usage. From further experiments, we found that the Gigabyte GA-8I945GMH-RH did not seem to endure the System Scans when hooked to our test pair of OCZ memory. Cosair's 5400UL would let us benchmark PCMark05 and 3DMark06 just fine. Using the F2 BIOS which was released after we received our review unit, did not fix the memory incompatibility issue. Until we further test the OCZ RAMs, it remains unclear whether the conflict was an engineering flaw on the part of OCZ or Gigabyte.</p>

<p align="justify">In order to stress the Gigabyte GA-8I945GMH-RH (especially the Voltage Regulation Modules) over long periods of time, we ran Folding@Home, a protein folding, distributed computing project by Stanford University. The board survived working on a GROMAC core for a couple of days straight without crashing. Under normal use, it is unlikely that a 100% CPU load would be imposed for more than 24 hours straight. I feel pretty glad to announce that Gigabyte has released another stable motherbord into the market again.</p>

<p align="justify">In case you happen to be interested, our <a href="http://forums.vr-zone.com.sg" TARGET="_blank">community</a> has a bunch of dedicated geeks who contribute their spare CPU cycles to Science, so why not join them at Team 48269? :D</p>

<p align="left"><font size="5">Thoughts</font></p>

<p align="justify">The Gigabyte GA-8I945GMH-RH was a joy to use for my day to day duties, and pretty much fulfilled its role as a Home Entertainment oriented motherboard. It is a solidly engineered product, with a couple of flaws that need addressing.</p>

<p align="justify">First of all, it appears irrational that Gigabyte decided to provide GMA950 graphics via a VGA 15 pin D-Sub analog connector. I would have hoped that Gigabyte would at least have provided a DVI output to benefit today's highend displays like Pioneer's Plasma Displays, Sony's Bravia, and InFocus's DLP projectors. Users of quality old school Three Gun CRT projectors may not fret, as a suitable patch cord would offer Component Video from the 15 pin D-Sub VGA connector.</p>

<p align="justify">Secondly, the lack of overclocking options was a letdown. On one hand we have Gigabyte's highly tweakable GA-G1975, and here the GA-8I945GMH-RH doesn't even have basic FSB, Vdimm and Vcore voltage options. The ICS clock syntheseiser used also lacks SMBUS control, making software overclocking impossible. Those who intend to overclock with a 945 motherboard, stay away! There are more overclocking-friendly relatives to the GA-8I945GMH-RH that may fit your bill.</p>

<p align="justify">Criticism aside, the GA-945GMH-RH is a nicely built motherboard that is a definite safe buy. It sports the right connectors at the right place, comes with a reasonable amount of hardware expansion options, and most of all, it is in the cute little mATX formfactor.</p>

<p align="justify">Pair the Gigabyte GA-8I945GMH-RH with a budget LGA dual core like the 805 Smithfield, in a miniature case such as Silverstonetek's SG-01 and it will make a lethal office PC with a high Wife-Acceptance-Factor. When you feel like letting out that geek-kid in you, just slot in a 7900GT and you are good-to-go for a LANParty. When you feel like it, you can purchase a few more to make miniature file servers, HTPCs, firewall, print-servers, BitTorrent machine or even Folding farms. Far fetched? I don't think so, for the Gigabyte GA-8I945GMH is already on the shelves and may be just a few clicks away from ending up in your Newegg shopping cart. This board goes for USD$ 120 (SGD$ 198), a few dollars more or less depending on where you buy it from.</p>
