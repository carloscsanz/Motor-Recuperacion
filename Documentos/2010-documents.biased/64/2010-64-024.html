				An X-ray-permeable bag is provided with a pair of hinged compartments carried by a handle in side-by-side relationship but are spread horizontally about a hinge for edge-to-edge placement on a conveyor belt so as to allow separate X-ray inspection of the compartments without content removal. In its preferred form, the bag permits separate scanning of a laptop computer and its accessories by utilizing a method that reduces the time required to perform an inspection while maintaining the integrity of the inspection process. 			</div>

No. 61/068,722, filed Mar. 10, 2008, for CHECKPOINT FRIENDLY LAPTOP BAG, by Marinus Bernard Bosma and Virginia Marie Bosma, included by reference herein and for which benefit of the priority date is hereby claimed. </p> <p>The present application is a continuation-in-part application of co-pending U.S. design patent application, Ser. No. 29/307,709, filed May 7, 2008, for CHECKPOINT FRIENDLY LAPTOP BAG, by Marinus Bernard Bosma and Virginia Marie Bosma, included by reference herein and for which benefit of the priority date is hereby claimed. </p> <p>The present application is a continuation-in-part application of co-pending U.S. design patent application, Ser. No. 29/328,103, filed Nov. 19, 2008, for CHECKPOINT FRIENDLY TROLLEY BAG WITH REMOVABLE LAPTOP CASE, by Marinus Bernard Bosma and Virginia Marie Bosma, included by reference herein and for which benefit of the priority date is hereby claimed. </p> <?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?> <?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?> <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION  </h1> <p>The present invention relates to a carry-on travel bag and, more particularly, to a laptop computer bag that allows X-ray inspection of the laptop computer without removing it from the bag. </p> <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </h1> <p>Over a quarter of all air travelers carry laptop computers with them when they pass through airport or other screening checkpoints. The requirement to remove the laptop computer from the bag is a common complaint. Despite the inconvenience it poses to passengers, it is a necessary requirement in order to ensure that the scanned image and more particularly an X-ray scanned image of the laptop computer is not further complicated by the superimposed images of the rest of the bag's contents. If a laptop computer bag were able to eliminate this requirement, it could lower passenger stress levels, increase checkpoint throughput, and reduce the number of claims received for laptop computers that have been damaged during screening. Screening checkpoints are in public buildings, airports; train stations and other forms of public transportation and many private enterprises such as businesses, military checkpoints and secure areas where there is a requirement to understand the composition and content of articles carried by someone into an area. Since screeners do not have time to re-screen laptops in bags that do not offer scanning compatibility, the bag must appear checkpoint friendly by its basic construction, instead of signs, logos, colors, materials or markings. Some airlines require additional fees for hold baggage so there is increasing pressure on passengers to bring baggage on board which increases the need for more efficient screening methods. </p> <p>Not carrying the laptop computer as carry-on baggage is the most common solution to the problem of removing the laptop computer from the bag for security screening. However, with business travelers who want to get to their destinations and return quickly, having to check baggage is an unnecessary burden on both time and effort especially if the laptop computer is all that is being checked. Also, checking a laptop computer subjects it to the wear and tear caused by baggage handlers, conveyor belts, harsh baggage hold environments and the potential to get lost. The traveler can eliminate all this by carrying the laptop computer with them on the flight. Also, they may use the laptop computer on board, making their travel time more productive. Some airlines charge for hold baggage which increases the need to bring the laptop with the passenger. </p> <p>There are several bags in the prior art with similar utility. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,509,515; 5,947,241; 6,230,771 and 6,257,381 have two individual bags that are attached to each other with fasteners but do not provide for the assemblage to be laid on the X-ray scanner belt so that no obstructions are in the way of a clear X-ray view of the contents. None of these inventions specifically addresses security screening. </p> <p>U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,371 is an attempt to ease security screening by allowing the bag to be peered into via a false panel. This invention does not require disassembly of the bag, but falls short of being X-ray friendly. </p> <p>The systems in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,293,635 and 6,637,563 are based on the theory that being able to see the contents of a bag visually is enough to clear it through security screening. If that were the case there would be no need to have items X-rayed. A clear bag will show the contents of the bag even if the contents are not what they appear to be. So X-ray screening is still required for these bags. </p> <p>It is not enough to make the contents visible. In the case of either of these clear bags, the laptop will still have to be removed in order to clear security if there are other items in the bag with it. Additionally, clear bags generally do not have a cushioning capability to protect the laptop from shock. The CarryClear™ laptop bag claims to have a clear cushioning capability but no examples have been shown. Australian provisional application, 2006/902437 discloses a clear laptop bag. The website for the CarryClear™ apparatus (http://carryclear.com) describes the product as being specifically designed for laptops and has some clear padding to protect the laptop. Like all the other preceding prior art, it does not address the suitability of X-ray screening. </p> <p>Another approach is an accessory for luggage called the scanner bag (http://www.gadgetduck.com/goods/scannerbag.html) which is a line of small bags that are attached to the luggage handle to hold small items that normally would be placed in plastic open top bins to go through the scanner. This item is not big enough to neither hold a laptop nor provide means of ensuring that the laptop is unobstructed if placed inside one. </p> <p>None of the prior art addresses the relationship between the design and X-ray screening which is the dominant technology for determining the safety of the public. Most of the prior art makes the assumption that being able to visually identify the contents of bags is sufficient. Seeing what appears to be a laptop computer through a transparent bag or a bag whose sides have been removed does not ensure that the contents are not cleverly disguised as an authorized item. Only by X-raying the articles and positively identifying its interior components can security screeners ensure no contraband. Therefore, despite having the items visible they still require removal from the bag if there are wires, power supplies, batteries, pens, keys or other items in the line of sight of the X-ray screening apparatus. </p> <p>It would be advantageous to provide a multi-compartment travel bag the compartments of which are carried side-by-side but are hinged for placement in end-to-end relationship on a belt for ease of X-ray screening. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a laptop computer bag that allows a laptop computer to be scanned at airport screening stations without having to be removed from its bag. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a laptop computer bag that protects the laptop computer from damage. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a format for the bag that is easily recognizable by airport security screening personnel as “checkpoint friendly,” a bag that allows the laptop computer to remain inside during security screening. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a laptop computer bag that can display the keyboard and display of the laptop without removing it from the bag for additional verification that the article in the bag is a functional laptop computer. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that has a laptop computer compartment so tightly fitting to the laptop that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to put other items in the bag with the laptop. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a multi-compartment travel bag where one compartment is intended only for a laptop computer. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that can be placed on and removed from the scanner belt without having to unsnap and re-snap fasteners. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that can be used as a work surface so that the laptop computer can be used without removing it from the bag. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that enables its easy deposit on and removal from a conveying belt through hand placement and handle pick-up respectively. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to eliminate the need for bins for containing laptop computers while scanning, as well as handling such bins in manual returning them to the inlet end of the scanner after each scanning cycle. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that can use different accessory bags so that the user can reconfigure the laptop computer bag and size thereof for different purposes, such as to accommodate an overnight change of clothing along with laptop computer accessories. </p> <p>It would also be advantageous to provide a bag that when folded open for X-ray screening does not exceed the standard aperture size of the X-ray scanner by having restraining elements holding the bags together. </p> <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </h1> <p>In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a laptop computer bag with a plurality of openable compartments so that the compartments can lie horizontally on the screening system conveyor. One side of the bag is for holding the laptop computer and nothing else. The other side of the bag has provisions for stowing objects that would otherwise obstruct a clear view of the laptop. The laptop compartment can swing out in a way to present it for the best aspect for X-ray scanning. The appearance of the bag with its two compartments and the manner in which they swing away from each other to lay flatly on the scanner belt distinguishes this laptop bag from standard laptop computer bag thereby making it readily recognizable by screening personnel as checkpoint friendly. The way this laptop computer bag is used is to cleave the laptop compartment away from the rest of the bag, lay the bag on the X-ray scanning platform whether a conveyor or stationary and lift the bag from the belt by the handle grip or shoulder straps restoring the bag to the pre-scanning configuration gravitationally. </p> <?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?> <?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?> <h1>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </h1> <p>A complete understanding of the present invention may be obtained by reference to the accompanying drawings, when considered in conjunction with the subsequent, detailed description, in which: </p> <p>FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the inventive checkpoint friendly laptop bag as it appears with the two compartments partially separated. </p> <p>FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the checkpoint friendly laptop bag showing its major components including the first compartment containing the laptop computer, second compartment and shoulder strap. </p> <p>FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the bag fully flattened by separating the compartments from each other. </p> <p>FIG. 4 is a back view of the bag with hooks and loop fasteners sewn to the fabric. </p> <p>FIG. 5 is a right perspective view of the bag laid flat and showing the way the two compartments are connected to each other via the shoulder strap swivel clips and the handle grip; and </p> <p>FIG. 6 is a front perspective view of the bag and a detailed view of the method of connecting the compartments via the shoulder strap swivel clip. </p> <?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?> <?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?> <p>For purposes of clarity and brevity, like elements and components will bear the same designations and numbering throughout the Figures. </p> <h1>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </h1> <p>FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a checkpoint friendly laptop bag as it appears with two compartments partially separated. In normal use the first compartment  <b>1 </b> with the laptop therein is parallel and against the second compartment  <b>2 </b>. They are secured by hook and loop fasteners  <b>17 </b>. The hook and loop fasteners  <b>17 </b> keep the two compartments  <b>1 </b>,  <b>2 </b> joined together when the bag is carried either by the handle  <b>5 </b> or shoulder strap  <b>11 </b>. This view also shows the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> adjustable by an adjusting buckle  <b>13 </b> and with its shoulder pad  <b>14 </b> attached to the laptop bag by means of the first compartment D-rings  <b>8 </b> and the second compartment D-rings  <b>7 </b> via the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> swivel clip  <b>9 </b>. The second compartment  <b>2 </b> handle  <b>4 </b> is connected to the first compartment  <b>1 </b> via the wrap-around padded handle  <b>5 </b>, which is affixed to the first compartment  <b>2 </b> handle  <b>6 </b>. The padded handle  <b>5 </b> is permanently affixed to the first compartment  <b>1 </b> handle  <b>6 </b>. </p> <p>FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a checkpoint friendly laptop bag showing its major components including the first compartment  <b>1 </b>, second compartment  <b>2 </b> and shoulder strap  <b>11 </b>. This view shows the cleavage  <b>26 </b> between the two compartments which identify this laptop bag as being able to cleave into a flattened aspect to give the X-ray scanner a better view of the contents. In order for screening authorities to recognize a checkpoint friendly carryon bag from one requiring additional screening or emptying there is a readily recognizable cleavage  <b>26 </b> between the first compartment  <b>1 </b> and the second compartment  <b>2 </b>. The logo  <b>3 </b> is prominently displayed on the outer surface of the first compartment  <b>1 </b> and is highly X-ray permeable by virtue of being constructed of X-ray permeable material or embroidered of the same material as the bag. In the case, of bags made of leather the logo  <b>3 </b> is embossed or debossed into the leather to maintain X-ray permeability. </p> <p>FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the bag fully flattened by separating the two compartments  <b>1 </b>,  <b>2 </b> from each other. The hinge is formed by a combination of D-rings  <b>7 </b>,  <b>8 </b>, swivel clips  <b>9 </b> and the handle  <b>5 </b>. This view also shows the logo  <b>3 </b> which identifies the first compartment  <b>1 </b> and the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> laying down but remains invisible due to its X-ray permeable adjusting buckle  <b>13 </b>, swivel clips  <b>9 </b>, shoulder pad  <b>14 </b> and webbing. </p> <p>This view also shows a second compartment  <b>2 </b> that is compact with a single zippered pocket  <b>23 </b> on the outside. This second compartment  <b>2 </b> can be changed easily by removing and replacing it with a variety of compartments designed for the needs of the user. This allows this bag to be converted from a day trip bag to an overnight bag to a weekend bag without compromising the ability for the bag to maintain checkpoint friendliness. </p> <p>FIG. 4 is a back view of the first compartment  <b>1 </b> bag with hook and loop fasteners  <b>17 </b> sewn to the fabric. These fasteners allow the first compartment  <b>1 </b> to cling to the second compartment  <b>2 </b> and keep them aligned and connected when not on the scanning belt. The handle  <b>5 </b> has a connecting grip that is permanently attached to this compartment allowing it to be used with a wide range of second compartments. The D-rings  <b>7 </b> are permanently attached to this bag via straps. Said D-rings  <b>7 </b> form the hinge along with the handle  <b>6 </b>. </p> <p>FIG. 5 is a right perspective view of the laptop bag laid flat and showing the way the two compartments  <b>1 </b>,  <b>2 </b> are connected to each other via the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> swivel clips  <b>9 </b> and the handle grip  <b>5 </b>. The shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> is shown lying on top of the first compartment  <b>1 </b>. The materials used in the construction of the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> are X-ray permeable and will not complicate the X-ray image of the contents of the first compartment  <b>1 </b>. The zipper  <b>12 </b> is around the perimeter of the compartment to stay clear of the X-ray beam. </p> <p>The large second compartment  <b>2 </b> is shown with an external compartment  <b>18 </b>. This is one of many possible second compartments  <b>2 </b>. There can only be one first compartment  <b>1 </b> because it has the connecting handle grip  <b>5 </b> but there are many potential second compartments  <b>2 </b>. The second compartment  <b>2 </b> shown in this view has a pouch  <b>18 </b> sewn on the side that big enough to store a weekend's provisions for a traveler. </p> <p>FIG. 6 is a front perspective view of a laptop bag and a detailed view of the method of connecting the compartments  <b>1 </b>,  <b>2 </b> via the shoulder strap  <b>11 </b> swivel clip  <b>9 </b>. There is also a phantom view of the laptop computer  <b>23 </b> showing how the laptop can be powered up to show the security screening authorities that the article in this side of the laptop bag is, in fact a functional computer, not a bomb disguised as a laptop computer. Also shown is the cover  <b>24 </b> with the zipper  <b>12 </b> going along three sides to allow it to open fully. The security strap  <b>22 </b> is shown in the closed position. </p> <p>When folded on itself like this the second compartment  <b>2 </b> forms a platform for the laptop computer  <b>23 </b>. The user can operate the laptop computer  <b>23 </b> while leaving it in the bag. The second compartment raises the laptop to a comfortable height and provides for insulation from the heat of the laptop computer  <b>23 </b> during operation. </p> <p>To use this laptop bag the user cleaves the first compartment  <b>1 </b> containing the laptop computer away from the second compartment  <b>2 </b> by pulling them away from each other and laying the entire assembly flatly on the conveyor belt or scanner tray. The assembly passes under the X-ray beam where it is inspected and once the inspection is finished and the bag emerges from the scanner the user lifts the bag from the scanner surface by either the handle  <b>5 </b> or shoulder strap  <b>11 </b>. The compartments  <b>1 </b>,  <b>2 </b> will fall back together gravitationally and cling to each other by the hook and loop fasteners  <b>17 </b> between the compartments. There is no further action required on the part of the user to restore the bag to the carry configuration. </p> <p>Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure, and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention. </p> <p>Having thus described the invention, what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims. </p> <?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?>						</div>
