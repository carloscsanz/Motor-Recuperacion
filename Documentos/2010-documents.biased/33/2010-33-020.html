      <h1 align="center">Shrunken Apple Heads</h1>
      <p>Nothings says spooky cool like a bunch of shrunken apple heads
      decorating your home. Best of all they are a great way to get the whole
      family involved in a project that won't break the budget.</p>
      <p>Here is what you'll need for the basic shrunken head. Options for
      creating more intricate heads are at the end of this article.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples (larger and firmer the better)</li>
        <li>Apple corer (optional)</li>
        <li>Vegetable peeler</li>
        <li>Paring knife</li>
        <li>Toothpicks</li>
        <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>Cookie rack</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare the apple - Your first step is to either core or not core
          the apple. This may sound odd but coring is optional. Removal helps
          dry the head quickly but is not strictly necessary. Next you will want
          to remove the skin. You can leave some patches of skin in your design
          but the more skin you leave the longer the apple will take to dry and
          the more prone to rotting it will be.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Mix lemon juice and salt together in a large bowl. Soak each apple
          in the mixture for a minute or so. This step is to help preserve the
          apple and keep them from browning too much. Don't worry if the mixture
          doesn't cover them completely. Just roll them around in the juice so
          all surfaces come in contact.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Carve your apple - This is where you can get really creative. Carve
          whatever design you want. For a traditional design try making a
          perfect human face. For creativity carve a monster or an alien. Use a
          paring knife for large details and toothpicks for fine detail
          remembering that apples contain a lot of water. They'll shrink to half
          their original size.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>After you've finished carving your head return the apple to the
          lemon juice and salt mixture to cover newly exposed areas.<br>
          &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Dry your apple heads - There are a number of ways of doing this. The
          simplest is to place them on cookie racks in a dry area turning them
          over every few days. They'll dry in week. If you live in a moist area
          like Daly City you'll want to place the apples on the cookie sheets
          and keep them in an oven set to its lowest setting until dry. If you
          find that the shrinking apples are loosing key details as they dry you
          can always touch them up with a knife or toothpick.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When your heads are near dry use a curved upholstery needle and
          thread to sew the lips of your apple shut like authentic shrunken
          heads.</li>
        <li>Add hair from an old Halloween wig to your apple head to look more
          authentic.</li>
        <li>Add long grain white rice for teeth.</li>
        <li>Add whole cloves for eyes.</li>
        <li>Color your apple head with charcoal or paint with food coloring.</li>
        <li>Preserve your apple head with a coat of shellac or wood sealer.</li>
        <li>Add witches hats or other clothing to make small dolls.</li>
      </ul>
