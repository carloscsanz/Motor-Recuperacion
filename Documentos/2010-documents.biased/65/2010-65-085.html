          <p class="darkblueblue"><strong>South Africa officially entered a recession in
mid-2009 resulting in soaring job losses with a
consequent decline in consumer affordability. These
negative conditions did not have an adverse effect
on the performance of the group as a whole. This
is attributable to the growing need of consumers
to have access to communication in the most
affordable and convenient way.</strong></p>
          <p>A combination of growth in subscribers and the
growing need for the group's bouquet of products
has resulted in growth in both revenue and
profitability at sustained levels of prepaid average
revenue per user (ARPU). This manifested itself in
revenue growth of 18% equating to an increase in
headline earnings per share of 19%.</p>
          <p>The above growth was achieved through a
combination of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An increase in local and international market
penetration</li>
            <li>Expansion in the range of prepaid electronic
tokens of value and other services facilitated by
the group</li>
            <li>Additional revenue from annuity income streams</li>
            <li>Economies of scale derived from operational and
strategic integration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>International expansion is of primary importance
to the strategy and vision of the group. Various
initiatives were launched, including the establishment
of Blue Label Mexico, Blue Label USA, Africa Prepaid
Services Nigeria and an investment in Ukash, a
United Kingdom based company.</p>
          <p>These initiatives augmented our existing presence
in India, Australia, Mozambique and the Democratic
Republic of Congo.</p>
          <p>The significance of the group's presence in South
Africa, together with its growing international
footprint, drives the expansion in the range of
products and services so as to allow the group to
capitalise on its distribution network. Our future
product and service offerings include ticketing
solutions, prepaid insurance, a single voucher for
multiple prepaid products and services, lotto sales
from mobile phones and till points and money
remittances.</p>
          <p>Consumers will be able to transact by means of
credit/debit cards, bank accounts, cash or Ukash
vouchers at their discretion.</p>
          <p class="darkblueuppercase">MICROSOFT</p>
          <p>Our relationship with Microsoft is an ongoing
strategic imperative. We share the common goal
of engaging consumers and profiling them more
effectively. Access to cutting-edge technology and
products enable efficient delivery to the market.
"LiveID" will facilitate inter-operability between
cellphones and personal computers, providing
substantial flexibility as products and solutions
become device agnostic.</p>
          <p>Over the past 18 months, we have worked with
Microsoft to deliver the next generation of mobile
services to the mass markets of the developing
world. mibli<sup>TM</sup> powered by Microsoft OneApp<sup>TM</sup>, a
completely integrated mobile "eco-system" was
launched in August 2009. This world first embodies
three solutions, namely:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transactional capability</li>
            <li>The mobile services functionality of our subsidiary,
the Mobile Services Company (MSC)</li>
            <li>Microsoft&rsquo;s OneApp&trade; on-phone software.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>mibli<sup>TM</sup> powered by Microsoft OneApp<sup>TM</sup> is free
to download and incorporates a wide range of
interactive features, such as Facebook, Twitter,
miLocate and a mobile wallet. An Apps store is
scheduled to be released shortly, which will add to
the revenue streams of white labelling, advertising
and content downloads.</p>
          <p>Accessed through a single window in the installations
menu of mobile phones, mibli<sup>TM</sup> powered by
Microsoft OneApp<sup>TM</sup> works on nearly every brand
and model of phone. GPRS and Java are the only
prerequisites from a functionality perspective.
Previously, this level of interactivity was only available
on top-of-the-range smartphones.</p>
          <p>The majority of mobile phones used in South Africa
are capable of running mibli<sup>TM</sup> powered by Microsoft
OneApp<sup>TM</sup>. Given the vast number of mobile phones
in use, the scale of opportunity to generate additional
revenue is substantial in that every user has the
ability to access and vend our prepaid products and
services through the mobile wallet feature.</p>
          <p>In addition, mibli<sup>TM</sup> powered by Microsoft OneApp<sup>TM</sup>
offers social networking platforms, which the
majority of consumers were not able to access
in the past.</p>
          <p class="darkblueuppercase">NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT </p>
          <p>The mandate is to create and formalise internal
product integration processes and develop
an internal set of skills, focused on product
development. This involves the identification of
products which fit and complement the existing
prepaid product range.</p>
          <p>The PowerPin voucher, which is an off-line prepaid
electricity top-up, consolidates the purchase of
prepaid electricity across national municipalities.</p>
          <p>The product offering of Cellfind has been enhanced
with the introduction of miTRAFFIC, an MMS report
on the status of traffic within a 50km radius of the
subscriber.</p>
          <p>Prepaid insurance is our most recent product
to enter a pilot phase. We have partnered with
Metropolitan's Cover2Go to offer a range of
products, such as funeral and commuter cover.</p>
          <p>In-country and cross-border remittances will be an
important focus in the future.</p>
          <p class="darkblueuppercase">Strategic acquisitions and investments</p>
          <p class="darkblueblue"><strong>Africa Prepaid Services Nigeria</strong></p>
          <p>In December 2008 Africa Prepaid Services
(Proprietary) Limited (APS) concluded a distribution
agreement with Multi-Links Telkom Limited, a
subsidiary of Telkom South Africa. This agreement
embraces the servicing of the entire distribution
channel of Multi-Links in Nigeria. Operations
successfully commenced in May 2009 and are
gaining momentum on a monthly basis.</p>
          <p class="darkblueblue"><strong>Blue Label Mexico</strong></p>
          <p>Blue Label Mexico commenced trading operations in
May 2009.</p>
          <p>The company is growing the number of points-ofpresence
and transactions per site.</p>
          <p>Key agreements have been concluded with both
mobile operators and important sales channels.
In the forthcoming year the company is targeting
points-of-presence which will cover a wide range of distribution channels, spanning multi-lane retailers
and petroleum forecourts, convenience outlets and
informal sales channels.</p>
          <p>A public telephony launch, in conjunction with
SharedPhone and Telefonica (a network provider in
Mexico), is currently in pilot phase over a platform of
2 000 units.</p>
          <p class="darkblueblue"><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong></p>
          <p>In December 2008, Blue Label USA, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the group, entered into a limited
partnership agreement with wholesale distributors
of physical international calling cards. The limited
partnership, namely VPN was established with the
objective of converting a captive client base from
physical to virtual distribution.</p>
          <p>In July 2009 Blue Label USA withdrew its capital
investment in the partnership and replaced it with a
technical agreement with Activi, another subsidiary
of Blue Label Telecoms. Blue Label USA was refunded
its full capital investment in the sum of US$5 million.
            <br />
            This technical agreement, which embodies
installation of intellectual property, maintenance and
support, will result in Activi receiving annual licence
fees and transactional fees generated from sales to
the country-wide captive base of the wholesalers.</p>
          <p class="darkblueblue"><strong>Ukash</strong></p>
          <p>The strategic investment holding in Smart Voucher
Limited trading as Ukash has provided the group
with technology that enables it to supply the end
user with prepaid Ukash vouchers which effectively
digitises cash. This voucher enables the customer to
transact on-line for multiple products and services
through a single prepaid voucher.</p>
          <p>The Ukash initiative has given the group the ability
to provide its products and services to a footprint
established by Ukash, covering several countries in
Europe.</p>
          <p>The Ukash issuing, redemption and settlement
platform facilitates integration with third party
devices and technology, ensuring rapid deployment
and broad-based coverage.</p>
          <p>Ukash has concluded a technology deal with
MasterCard "RePower" to be the recharge provider
for the launch of the prepaid debit cash loading
platform in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our medium/long-term strategy is that Ukash
will provide consumers with the means to cash-in,
utilise cash and cash-out at their own convenience.
This business model is aligned with our over-riding
purpose of delivering products and services to
communities, where such products and services
were previously inaccessible.</p>
          <p class="darkblueuppercase">Prospects</p>
          <p>We are well positioned to grow our footprint
organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our
global reach provides access to a wide range of
prepaid products and value-added services that
are viable additions to our existing offering in South
Africa and other emerging markets.</p>
          <p>It is anticipated that revenue will continue to grow
organically, not only through the existing product
offering, but also through the additional product
offerings that have been developed in-house and
which are expected to be rolled out across the
group's points-of-presence during the forthcoming
year.</p>
          <p>The Nigerian distribution initiative is expected
to contribute to the growth of our international
segment.</p>
          <p>Blue Label Mexico is steadily increasing its pointsof-
presence and turnover in accordance with its
business plan.</p>
          <p>There has been an improvement in the financial
performance of Oxigen India which is expected to
persist. Continued growth in outlets supplied and
new initiatives implemented in Oxigen is expected to
contribute towards Oxigen's improvement in the year
ahead. <br />
<br />
These initiatives include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduction in monthly expenditure</li>
            <li>Consolidation of technology competencies</li>
            <li>Improvement of connectivity and reliability of the
communications interface</li>
            <li>Introduction of prepaid e-toll recharge vouchers</li>
            <li>Piloting of prepaid railway ticketing</li>
            <li>An agreement with The State Bank of India to
pilot the PIN-less top-up of airtime and Oxicash
via mobile phones to its consumer base (the
integration is complete and testing is underway)</li>
            <li>An agreement with Nokia's Ovi stores to utilise
Oxicash as a payment mechanism for all Nokia
N-Gage products during the extended warranty
period</li>
            <li>The appointment of Oxigen as a service provider
of airtime sales in all Nokia branches.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Ukash transaction flow is expected to increase
with the advent of high-end redemption merchants
that have been added to its client portfolio. Its global
issuing footprint will continue to expand into new
territories which in turn will compound transactional
revenue.</p>
          <p>Technology partnerships will be pursued in line with
the model established in the USA.</p>
          <p>We constantly strive to increase shareholder value
through the expansion of the distribution base and
product and service offerings. Expense management
and stringent asset management will ensure positive
cash flow generation and growth in profitability.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that our investment in technology and
strategic acquisitions will enhance our distribution
capabilities, enabling the group to strike an equitable
balance between organic and acquisitive growth.</p>
          <p class="darkblueuppercase">Appreciation</p>
          <p>We thank the members of our board for their
guidance and leadership.</p>
          <p>We also express our sincere gratitude to our
executive team and employees for their invaluable
contribution to the success of Blue Label Telecoms.</p>
