	  <div class="post-content">
			<p>Yahoo chief executive Carol Bartz was appointed in January 2009 with the task of turning the troubled search company around.</p>
<p>Her predecessor, Jerry Yang, had overseen Yahoo&#8217;s decline in search market share against Google, and witnessed swinging share prices caused by a failed Microsoft acquisition attempt.</p>
<p>Advertisement<br />
When Bartz came in, the big question was whether she had the deal-making capabilities to secure a much needed sale of the search business to Microsoft, or at least some kind of partnership that would bring Yahoo significant revenue.</p>
<p>Reports had been circulating since May 2007 that Microsoft was about to make a bid for Yahoo and, when the $44.6bn (£30bn) offer arrived in January, the industry believed that the deal would appeal to Yahoo&#8217;s stakeholders and go ahead. Yahoo rejected the offer, however, citing a search deal with Google as one of the main reasons.</p>
<p>When the Google search advertising deal fell through, Yahoo&#8217;s share price collapsed and Yang stood down as chief executive. Rumours were rife in December 2008 that Microsoft would make another offer.</p>
<p>The first indicator that an outright acquisition was certainly on the cards was when Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer emphatically denied any chance of new acquisition talks at the Committee for Economic Development in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made an offer, we made another offer, it was clear Yahoo did not want to sell the business to us, and we moved on,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>
<p>But then a report in The Sunday Times claimed to have knowledge of a new deal that differed substantially from previous ones.</p>
<p>Rather than buying Yahoo&#8217;s search business upfront, Microsoft would obtain a 10-year operating agreement to manage Yahoo&#8217;s search division, while Yahoo would continue to run other parts of its business.</p>
<p>While all the details in the report have not materialised, the essence of what has now been announced by the two firms was captured by the report.</p>
<p>In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo announced a 10-year search partnership that Yahoo estimated would increase its revenue by approximately $500m (£305m) per annum.</p>
<p>The companies aim to have the deal closed by early 2010, following regulatory approval. The full implementation of the partnership will then occur in the following 24 months.</p>
<p>Under the terms agreed, Microsoft&#8217;s Bing will power Yahoo search, while Yahoo will use its solid relationship with advertisers to become the &#8220;salesforce&#8221; for both companies&#8217; search advertisers.</p>
<p>The pair claim that the deal will accelerate innovation in search, and make Bing-powered search more personally relevant to users because of its increased advertising strength. Microsoft said it will differentiate its search content from Google&#8217;s by pulling in content not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>There have since been rumours that Microsoft plans to sign a deal with News Corporation that will see certain news sites removed from Google&#8217;s index and ranked exclusively with Bing.</p>
<p>And Bing has been gaining ground on Google in recent months, according to market research firm comScore, although Yahoo search share has been decreasing.</p>
<p>Yet Bartz has made it clear that Yahoo is no longer driven to compete as a standalone search company, and has said that Microsoft&#8217;s expertise will let Yahoo concentrate its growth in the priority areas of display advertising capabilities and mobile experiences.</p>
<p>Yahoo aims to become the main online content portal for web users. The strategy is to increase the number of Yahoo pages to create more opportunities for display ads.</p>
<p>The main difficulty now will be for Microsoft to overcome an intellectual property lawsuit instigated by a US company called Bing! Information Design. The design firm is prosecuting the Redmond giant for copying its name, and argues that it has suffered a dent in sales during the past six months.</p>

			<p>The e-commerce industry is set to bounce back from a relatively poor year in 2009 by raking in £120 million in sales this Christmas Day as over four million UK shoppers go online for bargains, according to industry body the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG).</p>
<p>The IMRG predicted year on year growth in the region of 14 per cent, noting that it had already seen strong sales performances across e-commerce in the run up to Christmas with around £5.2bn expected to be spent online this month.</p>
<p>Advertisement<br />
 According to the industry body, many retailers will start their Christmas sales on Christmas Eve, with Boxing Day likely to be the busiest shopping day of the year.</p>
<p>Last year Christmas Day was the seventh busiest online day of the year with Boxing Day the busiest, according to Robin Goad, research director at Experian Hitwise.</p>
<p>“Over the last few years the importance of these two days has been increasing, and we see no reason for it to be any different this Christmas. We have already seen that shoppers are willing to hold out longer for a bargain this year,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;This behaviour is likely to carry through to the post-Christmas period, with people logging on after Christmas lunch to find the best discounts before hitting the high street and shopping malls the following day.”</p>

			<p>To say that 2009 was a wild year would be an understatement. It was a year in which the industry fought through an unprecedented crisis and struggled to see some rays of light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>It was, however, a better year for some companies than others. While virtually every area of the industry felt the impact from the economic crisis, a few sectors were able to thrive amid the chaos.</p>
<p>Advertisement<br />
This week we look back on the year and count down both the best and worst things about 2009.</p>
<p>HIGHS</p>
<p>5. Software-as-a-service<br />
Iain Thomson: Few industries have weathered the recession quite as well as software-as-a-service (SaaS).</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this. First, SaaS is primarily being sold as a cost saver, something that always goes down well in a recession. Second, the marginal cost of new clients is relatively low.</p>
<p>But when you come down to it, SaaS has been rather lucky. Just as the industry was coming to maturity, a recession kicked in and it found it had a selling point that few can resist.</p>
<p>One of the biggest losers in the SaaS space is Microsoft. Google and others are steadily eating into Redmond&#8217;s lucrative applications market and the software giant has been slow to react. Nevertheless, we are now seeing concrete evidence that Microsoft is taking the threat from SaaS seriously.</p>
<p>However, one potential stumbling block for the SaaS industry remains, and that is security. Leaving key corporate data in the hands of third parties is a security minefield and I suspect that in the next year we will see some security breaches that make people doubt the wisdom of moving to a service platform.</p>
<p>Shaun Nichols: Despite what Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff will tell you, SaaS was very much a concept that happened to hit in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Virtualisation and datacentre consolidation had come to maturity, then the recession hit and nobody wanted to have a major purchase on the balance sheet. This created a near perfect storm for SaaS, which required no hardware investment and a monthly subscription cost that looked very good on the budget.</p>
<p>Granted, because it had the &#8216;hot new technology&#8217; spotlight largely to itself we have all become a bit sick of the cloud computing label, but the concept is still strong and it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I can understand the security concerns associated with SaaS, but I don&#8217;t entirely agree with them. As Bruce Schneier noted, no new attack vector is opened up by cloud computing, and many companies already outsource some degree of infrastructure to a third party.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the virtualisation platforms used by many cloud systems have &#8217;sandbox&#8217; protections that can isolate systems and, in some cases, make them as - or more - secure than an on-premise systems.</p>
<p>4. Spam host shutdowns<br />
Shaun Nichols: It started in late 2008 with the shutdowns of estDomains and McColo, but in 2009 law enforcement and web authorities continued the push to take down shady hosting firms.</p>
<p>In June hosting firm 3FN was shut down amid charges of hosting spam and botnet control centres, and two months later authorities were able to take down notorious hosting service RealHost.</p>
<p>However, the efforts were not entirely fruitful. Just months after McColo&#8217;s shutdown devastated the market, spammers had recovered and pushed junk mail levels back up to record numbers. Security experts are also worried that the shutdowns have led cyber criminals to wise up and make efforts to distribute their command centres and attack systems rather than rely on a single host or system.</p>
<p>home page:<a href="http://www.rszip.com/">Full Downloads</a></p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s great to see an effort to finally put some pressure on not only the malware writers and botnet operators, but the hosting companies that harbour and protect cryber crime.</p>
<p>Iain Thomson: Botnets are like dragon&#8217;s teeth: kill one and another springs up in its place.</p>
<p>While it has taken a while for the internet industry to get around to shutting down ISPs that run malware systems on their servers, the result has been less than effective. Spamming is such a profitable concern that malware operators have got wise quickly and now have backup servers ready to continue deluging our inboxes with junk.</p>
<p>We are seeing a rapidly evolving criminal underworld reacting to the pressure of the legitimate computing industry trying to win back the high ground. I fear it will lose in the short term. It will take nothing less than a rewriting of the internet protocols to beat this problem.</p>
