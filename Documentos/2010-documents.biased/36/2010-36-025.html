The careers site that was created, careers dot sms dotac, does not seem to be ranking very well when you search for SMS.ac on google. You would think it would pull up on one of the first few pages because of the relevance, but it's not. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trader</div><div class="date">09-17-2006, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works perfectly weblord. I see that it has been indexed at google already. The major problem why some sites take a long time to rank on google is the lack of quality backlinks. Your site might not be indexed well that time and so you weren't ranking high for the keyword you wanted to search, or maybe there were some other sites better than yours or from much before, so they got their chance better there. :)</div></div><hr />

Meta tags don't matter, it pains me when people trouble themselves over them.</div></div><hr />

Meta tags do matter....as commented by on your other post about meta tags,   These are used by search engines to categorize sites and give search descriptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaabi</div><div class="date">09-27-2006, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Google doesn't use them, and I am fairly confident that MSN and Yahoo don't use them.  True, there are VERY SMALL search engines that use them, but the likes of somebody using that search engine and finding your site is slim to none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
again show proof of this...what do you think google uses as your title?  and Description when ppl search?  Yes you do not need them to get indexed, but its helps your site.  Metatags help the searcher not the indexer!\<br />

Another Article (http://www.pandia.com/sw-2005/16-metatags.html)<br />
<br />
Now why the importance is less nowadays, it does not mean its not needed....it still helps the end viewer and search engines use it to help display your site info.</div></div><hr />

I have read that article you, well, the first one.  The title tags and header tags matter, but meta tags, they don't no more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rohoni</div><div class="date">11-08-2006, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A query on Google often reveals thousands or even millions of matching web pages. Therefore, it is difficult for the user to find your website if it is not listed between the top 10, maximum 20 search results. <br />
The purpose of search engine optimization is to make a website's content highly relevant in order to get listed on top of search engine<br />
Selecting and Positioning Target Keywords - People search for stuff on the internet by typing certain words in the search box. Words that are relevant to your website are your target keywords. Your job is to make sure those target keywords appear on the crucial locations on your website such as across your title, meta tags, and body of your web page.<br />
Relevant Website Content - Imagine search engine as a library and your website as a book. The library only wants good quality books to be included in its collection. The content of your web site is therefore the most important element for search engines to terminate if your web site will be listed and ranked well. <br />
If your web site contains only images, flash, javascript etc, it will be ignored by the search engines because they can't read those graphics. Please remember to provide valuable information not just &quot;good looking&quot; image. Whenever possible, use HTML text on your web pages that will make your site more relevant.

Let's just forget about meta-tags.. he needs to concentrate on linkbuilding!</div></div><hr />

To correct it:<br />
Go on several forums and post replies (gives you links)<br />
- note: to check links put your site address in search without the http://www.<br />
and Google will return your links<br />
-<br />
Go on several site review forums and have them review your site<br />
-<br />
Do optimize your site including meta tags - they might not help directly but they do indirectly<br />
-<br />
submit your site to at least 50 search engines and/or directories (do it manually as you will have more control)<br />
-<br />
Optimize each page for position (note: individual pages can have their own pagerank)<br />
-<br />
Make sure each page has a home button (to return to your index page)<br />
people can enter your site by other than the index page<br />
-<br />
Post on several sites like Yahoo answers (I did say several)<br />
- Don't be surprised when your site is indexed and gets pagerank (check using several seo tools)<br />
hope this helps<br />
