          - August 25, 2009 </span>
        <p><img src="images/fdic.jpg" width="250" height="250"><br>
	          <span class="style41">The FDIC will soon be insolvent!<br>
        </span><span class="style41">They will need their coffer refilled with more funny money.</span></p>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>A few months ago in the early summer of 2009, I had a  prophetic dream about the banks of America failing. I have not gone into detail  about the dream, so I would like to do that now. And I would like to talk about  how to prepare for this event.</p>
	    <p class="style40">The dream begins:</p>
	    <p>I found myself standing on a street corner in a small town  somewhere in the USA.  As I looked across the street, there was a bank in a small building. The  building was perhaps 50 to 75 feet wide. It was a one story brick building with  large pane windows.</p>
	    <p>I suddenly heard the sound of propellers from an airplane.  The sound was coming from behind me. Before I had a chance to turn around and  look, a small propeller plane flew right over my head. It was a small passenger  plane that would hold about 20 people. It missed my head by about 10 or 15  feet. It then flew right into the windows of the bank across the street.</p>
	    <p>As it went through the windows and with the glass broken, I  could then see inside of the bank. I did not see many people, but I did see one  of the bank employees immediately stand up when the windows broke. His back was  to the windows and before he had a chance to turn around, one of the wings of  the plane knocked him down. He was wearing a white shirt and a tie. I knew that  he was the bank manager. But he did not see the plane coming. He was caught off  guard.</p>
	    <p>As I watched all of this happen, I found myself screaming in  my dream. I felt panic and dread! I ran across the street toward the bank. I  ran to the right of the building and up the driveway to the parking lot&nbsp; on the other side of the building.</p>
	    <p>When I got to the parking lot, I saw the engine of the plane  lying in front of me. As I looked to my left, I saw that the airplane had flown  entirely through the bank and exited through this side. I expected to see a lot  of debris inside the bank, including dead bodies. But I did not see that. It  was just one giant hole with broken windows on the entry side and exit side of  this bank. The furniture was gone; there was no debris, except for a  fluorescent light hanging down by wire.</p>
	    <p>There was another person, perhaps a bank customer standing  in front of me in the parking lot. I screamed to him, &quot;Where is the  plane?&quot; He pointed to my right and said, &quot;it crashed at the end of  the parking lot!&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="style40">The dream was over.</p>
	    <p class="style40">What does this mean?</p>
	    <p>Over the next few days, I pondered the dream and took the  matter to prayer. At first, I thought that this dream meant that a small plane  was going to crash into a bank. But the Holy Spirit of God explained it to me:</p>
	    <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>The       small bank that I was looking at in the dream represents the small banks       of America.</li>
	      <li>The       propeller plane represents the economy.</li>
	      <li>The       engine that fell into the parking lot represents the economic &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of America.</li>
	      <li>The       bank manager represents the leadership and owners of small banks. </li>
	      <li>The       crash of the plane represents an economic crash.</li>
        </ol>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p class="style40">So here is what is going to happen: </p>
	    <p>At some point in our future, that economic &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of this  country will no longer be able to bear its own weight. And it will fall off!  When the economic engine falls off, it will cause the economy to crash.</p>
	    <p>Before the economy hits bottom, i.e. the airplane hitting  the ground, it will take out and crash many small banks in America. When  the crashing economy hits the small banks, the banks will be cleaned out. This  is why I saw no debris in the banks. Does this mean they will be cleaned out of  all of their money?</p>
	    <p>Also, when this event happens, the owners and managers of  small banks will not see it coming. It will take them by surprise. This is why  I saw the plane wing hit the manager in the back. He did not see it coming.</p>
	    <p>I believe that the panic and fear that I had in the dream  will be the same panic that will overwhelm many people when this happens. Being  caught off guard without the access to money or ATM debit cards could cripple the  plans of Americans for days with no money to buy food or gas.</p>
	    <p>Also other things affected by sudden bank closures include:</p>
	    <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Access       to safety deposit boxes</li>
	      <li>Bill       pay programs &ndash; Will a computer somewhere still pay your bills? </li>
	      <li>Automatic       deposit &ndash; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your money?&rdquo;</li>
	      <li>Where       do you send your mortgage or credit card payment?</li>
	      <li>Will       checks bounce? &ndash; Will you get stuck with fees and a bad record?</li>
	      <li>Access       to your money &ndash; Was it insured? Will there be a delay getting it from the       FDIC?</li>
	      <li>Will a       new bank take over the operations? How smooth will the transition be? Will       your credit be affected because of loss payments or records?</li>
        </ol>
	    <p class="style40">When will this happen and What do I Do? </p>
	    <p>These are just a few of many issues that could arise in the  event of a bank failure.</p>
	    <p>You may be wondering, &ldquo;When will this crash happen?&rdquo; That  part I do not know. But I do consider this a warning from God.</p>
	    <p>What can you do about this? I would advise that you try to  keep track of the health of your bank. Some banks are doing better than others.  Some banks are very saturated with toxic loans. Finding out about the health of  a bank may not be easy because today, many banks are cooking their books and  lying to their customers. But in spite of this accusation, it would still be  wise to try to find out the health of your bank. There are websites that are  keeping track of the health of banks. </p>
	    <p>One of them is Bankrate. Here is their link: <a href="http://www.bankrate.com" target="_self" class="Linkset2">Read</a></p>
	    <p>Scroll down the left-hand side of the page to the section  called &ldquo;Safe and Sound Ratings&rdquo; <br>
	      or  <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/rates/safe-sound/bank-ratings-search.aspx" target="_self" class="Linkset2">Read</a></p>
	    <p>Then type in the name of your Bank or Credit Union. I do  have a caveat about researching the health of a particular bank. Their books  could be &ldquo;totally&rdquo; erroneous and untrue to get a better rating. So in addition  to researching your bank, I would also advise that you take the matter to  prayer and ask God what to do.</p>
	    <p>Perhaps one remedy is to spread your money or savings into  several banks. For those that are able, have some cash on hand. Some people  have chosen to diversify their liquid assets into precious metals. Some people  have chosen to invest their money offshore. Whatever you decide, let it be the  Lord's leading.</p>
	    <p>I know that an article like this can create fear, but my  intention is not to create fear. My purpose is to warn the people of God so  that they can be prepared when this event happens.</p>
	    <p>God bless you, and may all of you be dwelling under the  shelter of His wing.</p>
