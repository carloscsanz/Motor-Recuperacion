<p>The origins of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook">Facebook</a> have been in dispute since the very week a 19-year-old <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> launched the site as a Harvard sophomore on February 4, 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then called "thefacebook.com," the site was an instant hit.&nbsp; Now, six years later, the site has become one of the biggest web sites in the world, visited by 400 million people a month.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding Facebook began quickly.&nbsp; A week after he launched the site in 2004, Mark was accused by three Harvard seniors of having stolen the idea from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allegation soon bloomed into a full-fledged lawsuit, as a competing company founded by the Harvard seniors sued Mark and Facebook for theft and fraud, starting a legal odyssey that continues to this day.</p>
<p>New information uncovered by <em>Silicon Alley Insider</em> suggests that some of the complaints against Mark Zuckerberg are valid.&nbsp; It also suggests that, on at least one occasion in 2004, Mark <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3">used private login data taken from Facebook's servers to break into Facebook members' private email accounts and read their emails</a>--at best, a gross misuse of private information. Lastly, it suggests that Mark <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-connectu-2010-3">hacked into the competing company's systems and changed some user information</a> with the aim of making the site less useful.</p>
<p>The primary dispute around Facebook's origins centered around whether Mark had entered into an "agreement" with the Harvard seniors, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and a classmate named Divya Narendra, to develop a similar web site for them -- and then, instead, stalled their project while taking their idea and building his own.</p>
<p>The litigation never went particularly well for the Winklevosses.</p>
<p>In 2007, Massachusetts Judge Douglas P. Woodlock called their allegations "tissue thin." Referring to the&nbsp; agreement that Mark had allegedly breached, Woodlock also wrote, "Dorm room chit-chat does not make a contract." A year later, the end finally seemed in sight: a judge ruled against Facebook's move to dismiss the case. Shortly thereafter, the parties agreed to settle.</p>
<p>But then, a twist.</p>
<p>After Facebook announced the settlement, but before the settlement was finalized, lawyers for the Winklevosses suggested that the hard drive from Mark Zuckerberg's computer at Harvard might contain evidence of Mark's fraud. Specifically, they suggested that the hard drive included some damning instant messages and emails.</p>
<p>The judge in the case refused to look at the hard drive and instead deferred to another judge who went on to approve the settlement. But, naturally, the possibility that the hard drive contained additional evidence set inquiring minds wondering what those emails and IMs revealed.&nbsp; Specifically, it set inquiring minds wondering again whether Mark had, in fact, stolen the Winklevoss's idea, screwed them over, and then ridden off into the sunset with Facebook.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the contents of Mark's hard drive had not been made public, no one had the answers.</p>
<p>But now we have some.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we have interviewed more than a dozen sources familiar with aspects of this story -- including people involved in the founding year of the company. We have also reviewed what we believe to be some relevant IMs and emails from the period.&nbsp; Much of this information has never before been made public.&nbsp; None of it has been confirmed or authenticated by Mark or the company.</p>
<p>Based on the information we obtained, we have what we believe is a more complete picture of how Facebook was founded.&nbsp; This account follows.</p>
<p>And what does this more complete story reveal?</p>
<p>We'll offer our own conclusions at the end.&nbsp; But first, here's the story:</p>

The site was to be called HarvardConnections.com.</p>
<p>The three had been paying Victor Gao, another Harvard student, to do coding for the site, but at the beginning of the fall term Victor begged off the project. Victor suggested his own replacement: Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard sophomore from Dobbs Ferry, New York.</p>
<p>Back then, Mark was known at Harvard as the sophomore who had built Facemash, a "Hot Or Not" clone for Harvard. Facemash had already made Mark a bit of a celebrity on campus, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that Mark got in trouble for creating it. The way the site worked was that it pulled photos of Harvard students off of Harvard's Web sites. It rearranged these photos so that when people visited Facemash.com they would see pictures of two Harvard students and be asked to vote on which was more attractive. The site also maintained a list of Harvard students, ranked by attractiveness.</p>
<p>On Harvard's politically correct campus, this upset people, and Mark was soon hauled in front of Harvard's disciplinary board for students.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/">According to a November 19, 2003<em> Harvard Crimson</em> article</a>, he was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Happily for Mark, the article reports that he wasn't expelled.</p>
<p>The second reason everyone at Harvard knew about Facemash and Mark Zuckerberg was that Facemash had been an instant hit. The same <em>Harvard Crimson</em> story reports that after two weeks, "the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times." That means the average visitor voted 48 times.</p>
<p><img class="float_left" src="/image/3db9b914aad791491cb91900/winklevoss-twins.jpg" border="0" alt="winklevoss twins" />It was for this ability to build a wildly popular site that Victor Gao first recommended Mark to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Sold on Mark, the Harvard Connection trio reached out to him. Mark agreed to meet.</p>
<p>They first met in the early evening on November 30 in the dining hall of Harvard College's Kirkland House.&nbsp; Cameron, Tyler, and Divya brought up their idea for Harvard Connection, and described their plans to A) build the site for Harvard students only, by requiring new users to register with Harvard.edu email addresses, and B) expand Harvard Connection beyond Harvard to schools around the country.&nbsp; Mark reportedly showed enthusiastic interest in the project.</p>
<p>Later that night, Mark wrote an email to the Winklevoss brothers and Divya: "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night."</p>
<p>The next day, on December 1, Mark sent another email to the HarvardConnections team.&nbsp; Part of it read, "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional."</p>
<p>These two emails sounded like the words of someone who was eager to be a part of the team and working away on the project.&nbsp; A few days later, however, Mark's emails to the HarvardConnection team started to change in tone.&nbsp; Specifically, they went from someone who seemed to be hard at work building the product to someone who was so busy with schoolwork that he had no time to do any coding at all.<br /><br />December 4: "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set."<br /><br />December 10: "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway."<br /><br />A week later: "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I"m still not finished with."</p>
<p>Finally, on January 8:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sorry it's taken a while for me to get back to you. I'm completely swamped with work this week. I have three programming projects and a final paper due by Monday, as well as a couple of problem sets due Friday. I'll be available to discuss the site again starting Tuesday.<br /><br />I"m still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run&hellip;Anyhow, we'll talk about it once I get everything else done.</p>
<p>So what happened to change Mark's tune about HarvardConnection? Was he so swamped with work that he was unable to finish the project?&nbsp; Or, as the HarvardConnection founders have alleged, was he stalling the development of HarvardConnection so that he could build a competing site and launch it first?<br /><br />Our investigation suggests the latter.<br /><br />As a part of the lawsuit against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, the above emails from Mark have been public for years. What has never been revealed publicly is what Mark was telling his friends, parents, and closest confidants at the same time.<br /><br />Let's start with a December 7th (IM) exchange Mark Zuckerberg had with his Harvard classmate and Facebook cofounder, Eduardo Saverin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

They asked me to make it for them.&quot;" border="0" class="slide-image" /></div>Former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel gets a lot of credit for being the first investor in Facebook, because he led the first formal Facebook round in September of 2004 with a $500,000 investment at a $5 million valuation.&nbsp; But the real "first investor" claim to fame should actually belong to a Harvard classmate of Mark Zuckerberg's named Eduardo Saverin. <br /><br />To picture Eduardo, what you need to know is that he was the kid at Harvard who would wear a suit to class. He liked to give people the impression that he was rich -- and maybe somehow connected to the Brazilian mafia.&nbsp; At one point, in an IM exchange, Mark told a friend that Eduardo -- "head of the investment society" -- was rich because "apparently insider trading isn't illegal in Brazil."</p>
<p>Eduardo Saverin wasn't directly involved with Facebook for long: During the summer of 2004, when Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time, Eduardo took a high-paying internship at Lehman Brothers in New York.&nbsp; While Mark was still at Harvard, however, Eduardo appears to have bankrolled Facebook's earliest capital expenses, thus becoming its initial investor.<br /><br />In January, however, Mark told a friend that "Eduardo is paying for my servers." Eventually, Eduardo would agree to invest $15,000 in a company that would, in April 2004, be formed as Facebook LLC.&nbsp; For his money, Eduardo would get 30% of the company.</p>
<p>Eduardo was also involved in Facebook's earliest days, as a confidant of Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>In December, 2003, a week after Mark's first meeting with the HarvardConnection team, when he was telling the Winklevosses that he was too busy with schoolwork to work on or even think about HarvardConnection.com, Mark was telling Eduardo a different story.&nbsp; On December 7, 2003, we believe Mark sent Eduardo the following IM:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Check this site out: www.harvardconnection.com and then go to harvardconnection.com/datehome.php. Someone is already trying to make a dating site. <strong>But they made a mistake haha. They asked me to make it for them. So I'm like delaying it so it won't be ready until after the facebook thing comes out.</strong></p>
<p>This IM suggests that, within a week of meeting with the Winklevosses for the first time, Mark had already decided to start his own, similar project--"the facebook thing."&nbsp; It also suggests that he had developed a strategy for dealing with his would-be competition: Delay developing it.</p>

<p>This time, instead of meeting in the dining hall of Mark's residential hall, Kirkland House, the four met in Mark's dorm room. Divya is said to have arrived late. <br /><br />In Kirkland House, the dorm rooms aren't laid out in cinder-block-cube style: Mark's room had a narrow hallway connecting it to his neighbor's. As Cameron and Tyler sat down on a couch in Mark's room, Cameron spotted something in the hallway. On top of a bookshelf there was a white board. It was the kind Web developers and product managers everywhere use to map out their ideas.</p>
<p>On it, Cameron read two words, "Harvard Connection." He got up to go look at it. Immediately, Mark asked Cameron to stay out of the hallway.</p>
<p>Eventually Divya arrived and the four of them talked about plans for Harvard Connection. One feature Mark brought up was designed to keep more popular and sought-after Harvard Connection users from being stalked and harassed by crowds of people.</p>
<p>In this second meeting, Mark still appeared to be actively engaged in developing Harvard Connection.&nbsp; But he never showed the HarvardConnection folks any site prototypes or code.&nbsp; And they didn't insist on seeing them.<br /><br />During the weeks in which Mark was juggling the two projects in tandem, he also had a series of IM exchanges with a friend named Adam D'Angelo (above).<br /><br />Adam and Mark went to boarding school together at Phillips Exeter Academy. There, the pair became friends and coding partners. Together they built a program called Synapse, a music player that supposedly learned the listener's taste and then adapted to it. Then, in 2002 Mark went to Harvard and Adam went to Cal Tech.&nbsp; But the pair stayed in close touch, especially through AOL instant messenger. Eventually, Adam became Facebook's CTO.</p>
<p><img class="float_right" src="/image/4b9020cc7f8b9afb56ad0300/harvard-yard-at-winter.jpg" border="0" alt="Harvard Yard at Winter" />Through the Harvard Connection-Facebook saga and its aftermath, Mark kept Adam apprised of his plans and thoughts. <br /><br />One purported IM exchange seems particularly relevant on the question of how Mark distinguished between the two projects--the "facebook thing" and "the dating site"--as well as how he was considering handling the latter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: So you know how I'm making that dating site</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: I wonder how similar that is to the Facebook thing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: Because they're probably going to be released around the same time</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck:<strong> Unless I fuck the dating site people over and quit on them right before I told them I'd have it done.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D'Angelo: haha</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: Like I don't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: and I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: But the guy doing the dating thing is going to promote it pretty well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: I wonder what the ideal solution is.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: I think the Facebook thing by itself would draw many people, unless it were released at the same time as the dating thing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: In which case both things would cancel each other out and nothing would win. Any ideas? Like is there a good way to consolidate the two.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D'Angelo: We could make it into a whole network like a friendster. haha. Stanford has something like that internally<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br /></span>Zuck: Well I was thinking of doing that for the facebook. The only thing that's different about theirs is that you like request dates with people or connections with the facebook you don't do that via the system.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D'Angelo: Yeah</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: I also hate the fact that I'm doing it for other people haha. Like I hate working under other people. I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before I'm supposed to have their thing ready and then be like "look yours isn't as good as this so if you want to join mine you can&hellip;otherwise I can help you with yours later." Or do you think that's too dick?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D'Angelo: I think you should just ditch them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: The thing is they have a programmer who could finish their thing and they have money to pour into advertising and stuff. Oh wait I have money too. My friend who wants to sponsor this is head of the investment society. Apparently insider trading isn't illegal in Brazil so he's rich lol.</p>

<p>In January 2004, Mark met with the Winklevoss brothers and Divya Narendra for what would be the last time. The meeting was on January 14, 2004, and it was held at the same place Mark met with the HarvardConnection team for the first time -- in the dining hall of Mark's residence, Kirkland House.</p>
<p>By this point, Mark's site, thefacebook.com, wasn't complete, but he was working hard on it. He'd arranged for Eduardo Saverin to pay for his servers. He had already told Adam that "the right thing to do" was to not complete Harvard Connection and build TheFacebook.com instead.&nbsp; He had registered the domain name.</p>
<p>He therefore had a choice to make: Tell Cameron, Tyler and Divya that he wanted out of their project, or string them along until he was ready to launch thefacebook.com.</p>
<p>Mark sought advice on this decision from his confidants. One friend told him, in so many words, you know me. I don't ever think anyone should do anything bad to anybody.</p>
<p>Mark and this friend also had the following IM exchange about how Mark planned to resolve the competing projects:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Friend: So have you decided what you're going to do about the websites?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: Yeah, I'm going to fuck them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: Probably in the year</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Zuck: *ear</p>
<p>And so, it appears, he did.&nbsp; (In a manner of speaking).</p>
<p>On January 14, 2004, Mark Zuckerberg met with Cameron, Tyler, and Divya for the last time. During the meeting at Kirkland House, Mark expressed doubts about the viability of HarvardConnection.com. He said he was very busy with personal projects and school work and that he wouldn't be able to work on the site for a while. He blamed others for the site's delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He did not say that he was working on his own project and that he was not planning to complete the HarvardConnection site.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mark had another IM exchange with the friend above. He told her, in effect, that he had wimped out. He hadn't been able to break the news to Cameron and Tyler, in part, he said, because he was "intimidated" by them. He called them "poor bastards."</p>
<p>So then what happened?</p>
<p>Three days earlier, on January 11, 2004, Mark had registered the domain THEFACEBOOK.COM.</p>
<p>On February 4, he opened the site to Harvard students.</p>
<p>On February 10, Cameron Winklevoss sent Mark a letter accusing him of breaching their agreement and stealing their idea.</p>
<p>In late May, after going through two more developers, Cameron, Tyler and Divya launched HarvardConnection as ConnectU, a social network for 15 schools.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2004, a commencement speaker mentioned the amazing popularity of Mark's site, thefacebook.com.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time and soon received a $500,000 investment from Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>In September 2004, HarvardConnection, now called ConnectU, sued Mark Zuckerberg and the now-incorporated "Facebook" for allegedly breaching their agreement and stealing their idea.</p>
<p>In February 2008, Facebook and ConnectU agreed to settle the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In June 2008, ConnectU appealed the settlement in California's ninth district, accusing Facebook of trading its stock without disclosing material information. This appeal is on-going.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We&rsquo;re not going to debate the disgruntled litigants and anonymous sources who seek to rewrite Facebook&rsquo;s early&nbsp;history or embarrass Mark Zuckerberg with dated allegations. The unquestioned fact is that since leaving Harvard for&nbsp;Silicon Valley nearly six years ago, Mark has led Facebook's growth from a college website to a global service playing&nbsp;an important role in the lives of over 400 million people."</p>
<p>On the latter point, we agree.&nbsp; What Mark Zuckerberg has accomplished with Facebook over the past six years has been nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>So, having revisited the founding of Facebook with additional information, what do we conclude?</p>
<p>First, we have seen no evidence of any formal contract between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevosses in which Mark agreed to develop Harvard Connection.</p>
<p>Second, any agreement the parties may have had--as well as most of the purported IMs and emails we have reviewed from the period--appear to have been at the level of, as Judge Ware described them, "dorm-room chit-chat." (Albeit interesting and entertaining chit-chat.)</p>
<p>Third, only a week after beginning development of Harvard Connection, which he referred to as "the dating site," Mark had begun work on a separate project -- "the facebook thing." Mark appears to have considered the products as competing for the attention of the same users, but he also appears to have regarded them as different in some key ways.</p>
<p>Fourth -- and because of this foreseen competition -- Mark does appear to have intentionally strung along the Harvard Connection folks with the goal of making his project, thefacebook.com, have a more successful launch.</p>
<p>Bottom line, we haven't seen anything that makes us think that, whatever Mark did to the Harvard Connection folks, it was worth more than the $65 million they received in the lawsuit settlement.&nbsp; In fact, this seems like a huge sum of money considering that the entire dispute took place over two months in 2004 and that, in the six years since, Mark has built Facebook into a massive global enterprise.</p>
<p>That said, in the course of our investigation, we also uncovered two additional anecdotes about Mark's behavior in Facebook's early days that are more troubling. These episodes -- an apparent hacking into the email accounts of Harvard Crimson editors using data obtained from Facebook logins, as well as a later hacking into ConnectU -- are described in detail here.</p>

The site was to be called HarvardConnections.com.<\/p>\n<p>The three had been paying Victor Gao, another Harvard student, to do coding for the site, but at the beginning of the fall term Victor begged off the project. Victor suggested his own replacement: Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard sophomore from Dobbs Ferry, New York.<\/p>\n<p>Back then, Mark was known at Harvard as the sophomore who had built Facemash, a \"Hot Or Not\" clone for Harvard. Facemash had already made Mark a bit of a celebrity on campus, for two reasons.<\/p>\n<p>The first is that Mark got in trouble for creating it. The way the site worked was that it pulled photos of Harvard students off of Harvard's Web sites. It rearranged these photos so that when people visited Facemash.com they would see pictures of two Harvard students and be asked to vote on which was more attractive. The site also maintained a list of Harvard students, ranked by attractiveness.<\/p>\n<p>On Harvard's politically correct campus, this upset people, and Mark was soon hauled in front of Harvard's disciplinary board for students.&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecrimson.com\/article\/2003\/11\/19\/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the\/\">According to a November 19, 2003<em> Harvard Crimson<\/em> article<\/a>, he was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Happily for Mark, the article reports that he wasn't expelled.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason everyone at Harvard knew about Facemash and Mark Zuckerberg was that Facemash had been an instant hit. The same <em>Harvard Crimson<\/em> story reports that after two weeks, \"the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times.\" That means the average visitor voted 48 times.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"float_left\" src=\"\/image\/3db9b914aad791491cb91900\/winklevoss-twins.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"winklevoss twins\" \/>It was for this ability to build a wildly popular site that Victor Gao first recommended Mark to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Sold on Mark, the Harvard Connection trio reached out to him. Mark agreed to meet.<\/p>\n<p>They first met in the early evening on November 30 in the dining hall of Harvard College's Kirkland House.&nbsp; Cameron, Tyler, and Divya brought up their idea for Harvard Connection, and described their plans to A) build the site for Harvard students only, by requiring new users to register with Harvard.edu email addresses, and B) expand Harvard Connection beyond Harvard to schools around the country.&nbsp; Mark reportedly showed enthusiastic interest in the project.<\/p>\n<p>Later that night, Mark wrote an email to the Winklevoss brothers and Divya: \"I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.\"<\/p>\n<p>The next day, on December 1, Mark sent another email to the HarvardConnections team.&nbsp; Part of it read, \"I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional.\"<\/p>\n<p>These two emails sounded like the words of someone who was eager to be a part of the team and working away on the project.&nbsp; A few days later, however, Mark's emails to the HarvardConnection team started to change in tone.&nbsp; Specifically, they went from someone who seemed to be hard at work building the product to someone who was so busy with schoolwork that he had no time to do any coding at all.<br \/><br \/>December 4: \"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set.\"<br \/><br \/>December 10: \"The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway.\"<br \/><br \/>A week later: \"Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I\"m still not finished with.\"<\/p>\n<p>Finally, on January 8:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Sorry it's taken a while for me to get back to you. I'm completely swamped with work this week. I have three programming projects and a final paper due by Monday, as well as a couple of problem sets due Friday. I'll be available to discuss the site again starting Tuesday.<br \/><br \/>I\"m still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run&hellip;Anyhow, we'll talk about it once I get everything else done.<\/p>\n<p>So what happened to change Mark's tune about HarvardConnection? Was he so swamped with work that he was unable to finish the project?&nbsp; Or, as the HarvardConnection founders have alleged, was he stalling the development of HarvardConnection so that he could build a competing site and launch it first?<br \/><br \/>Our investigation suggests the latter.<br \/><br \/>As a part of the lawsuit against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, the above emails from Mark have been public for years. What has never been revealed publicly is what Mark was telling his friends, parents, and closest confidants at the same time.<br \/><br \/>Let's start with a December 7th (IM) exchange Mark Zuckerberg had with his Harvard classmate and Facebook cofounder, Eduardo Saverin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/they-made-a-mistake-haha-they-asked-me-to-make-it-for-them-2\">Continue --&gt;<\/a><\/h3>","uri":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1"},{"name":"they-made-a-mistake-haha-they-asked-me-to-make-it-for-them-2","title":"\"They made a mistake haha.

He liked to give people the impression that he was rich -- and maybe somehow connected to the Brazilian mafia.&nbsp; At one point, in an IM exchange, Mark told a friend that Eduardo -- \"head of the investment society\" -- was rich because \"apparently insider trading isn't illegal in Brazil.\"<\/p>\n<p>Eduardo Saverin wasn't directly involved with Facebook for long: During the summer of 2004, when Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time, Eduardo took a high-paying internship at Lehman Brothers in New York.&nbsp; While Mark was still at Harvard, however, Eduardo appears to have bankrolled Facebook's earliest capital expenses, thus becoming its initial investor.<br \/><br \/>In January, however, Mark told a friend that \"Eduardo is paying for my servers.\" Eventually, Eduardo would agree to invest $15,000 in a company that would, in April 2004, be formed as Facebook LLC.&nbsp; For his money, Eduardo would get 30% of the company.<\/p>\n<p>Eduardo was also involved in Facebook's earliest days, as a confidant of Mark Zuckerberg.<\/p>\n<p>In December, 2003, a week after Mark's first meeting with the HarvardConnection team, when he was telling the Winklevosses that he was too busy with schoolwork to work on or even think about HarvardConnection.com, Mark was telling Eduardo a different story.&nbsp; On December 7, 2003, we believe Mark sent Eduardo the following IM:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Check this site out: www.harvardconnection.com and then go to harvardconnection.com\/datehome.php. Someone is already trying to make a dating site. <strong>But they made a mistake haha. They asked me to make it for them. So I'm like delaying it so it won't be ready until after the facebook thing comes out.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This IM suggests that, within a week of meeting with the Winklevosses for the first time, Mark had already decided to start his own, similar project--\"the facebook thing.\"&nbsp; It also suggests that he had developed a strategy for dealing with his would-be competition: Delay developing it.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/i-feel-like-the-right-thing-to-do-is-finish-the-facebook-and-wait-until-the-last-day-before-im-supposed-to-have-their-thing-ready-and-then-be-like-look-yours-isnt-as-good-3\">Continue --&gt;<\/a><\/h3>","uri":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/they-made-a-mistake-haha-they-asked-me-to-make-it-for-them-2"},{"name":"i-feel-like-the-right-thing-to-do-is-finish-the-facebook-and-wait-until-the-last-day-before-im-supposed-to-have-their-thing-ready-and-then-be-like-look-yours-isnt-as-good-3","title":"\"I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before I'm supposed to have their thing ready and then be like look yours isn't as good\"","image":"4b8d587c7f8b9a146d780000","left":0,"html":"<p><div class=\"image-container slide-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.businessinsider.com\/image\/4b8d587c7f8b9a146d780000-400-300\/i-feel-like-the-right-thing-to-do-is-finish-the-facebook-and-wait-until-the-last-day-before-im-supposed-to-have-their-thing-ready-and-then-be-like-look-yours-isnt-as-good.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;I feel like the right thing to do is finish the facebook and wait until the last day before I'm supposed to have their thing ready and then be like look yours isn't as good&quot;\" border=\"0\" class=\"slide-image\" \/><\/div>A few weeks after the initial meeting with the HarvardConnection team, after Mark sent the IM to Eduardo Saverin talking about developing \"the facebook thing\" and delaying his development of HarvardConnection, Mark met with the HarvardConnection folks, Cameron, Tyler, and Divya, for a second time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This time, instead of meeting in the dining hall of Mark's residential hall, Kirkland House, the four met in Mark's dorm room. Divya is said to have arrived late. <br \/><br \/>In Kirkland House, the dorm rooms aren't laid out in cinder-block-cube style: Mark's room had a narrow hallway connecting it to his neighbor's. As Cameron and Tyler sat down on a couch in Mark's room, Cameron spotted something in the hallway. On top of a bookshelf there was a white board. It was the kind Web developers and product managers everywhere use to map out their ideas.<\/p>\n<p>On it, Cameron read two words, \"Harvard Connection.\" He got up to go look at it. Immediately, Mark asked Cameron to stay out of the hallway.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually Divya arrived and the four of them talked about plans for Harvard Connection. One feature Mark brought up was designed to keep more popular and sought-after Harvard Connection users from being stalked and harassed by crowds of people.<\/p>\n<p>In this second meeting, Mark still appeared to be actively engaged in developing Harvard Connection.&nbsp; But he never showed the HarvardConnection folks any site prototypes or code.&nbsp; And they didn't insist on seeing them.<br \/><br \/>During the weeks in which Mark was juggling the two projects in tandem, he also had a series of IM exchanges with a friend named Adam D'Angelo (above).<br \/><br \/>Adam and Mark went to boarding school together at Phillips Exeter Academy. There, the pair became friends and coding partners. Together they built a program called Synapse, a music player that supposedly learned the listener's taste and then adapted to it. Then, in 2002 Mark went to Harvard and Adam went to Cal Tech.&nbsp; But the pair stayed in close touch, especially through AOL instant messenger. Eventually, Adam became Facebook's CTO.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"float_right\" src=\"\/image\/4b9020cc7f8b9afb56ad0300\/harvard-yard-at-winter.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Harvard Yard at Winter\" \/>Through the Harvard Connection-Facebook saga and its aftermath, Mark kept Adam apprised of his plans and thoughts. <br \/><br \/>One purported IM exchange seems particularly relevant on the question of how Mark distinguished between the two projects--the \"facebook thing\" and \"the dating site\"--as well as how he was considering handling the latter:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: So you know how I'm making that dating site<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: I wonder how similar that is to the Facebook thing<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: Because they're probably going to be released around the same time<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck:<strong> Unless I fuck the dating site people over and quit on them right before I told them I'd have it done.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">D'Angelo: haha<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: Like I don't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: and I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: But the guy doing the dating thing is going to promote it pretty well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: I wonder what the ideal solution is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: I think the Facebook thing by itself would draw many people, unless it were released at the same time as the dating thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: In which case both things would cancel each other out and nothing would win.

The meeting was on January 14, 2004, and it was held at the same place Mark met with the HarvardConnection team for the first time -- in the dining hall of Mark's residence, Kirkland House.<\/p>\n<p>By this point, Mark's site, thefacebook.com, wasn't complete, but he was working hard on it. He'd arranged for Eduardo Saverin to pay for his servers. He had already told Adam that \"the right thing to do\" was to not complete Harvard Connection and build TheFacebook.com instead.&nbsp; He had registered the domain name.<\/p>\n<p>He therefore had a choice to make: Tell Cameron, Tyler and Divya that he wanted out of their project, or string them along until he was ready to launch thefacebook.com.<\/p>\n<p>Mark sought advice on this decision from his confidants. One friend told him, in so many words, you know me. I don't ever think anyone should do anything bad to anybody.<\/p>\n<p>Mark and this friend also had the following IM exchange about how Mark planned to resolve the competing projects:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Friend: So have you decided what you're going to do about the websites?<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: Yeah, I'm going to fuck them<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: Probably in the year<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Zuck: *ear<\/p>\n<p>And so, it appears, he did.&nbsp; (In a manner of speaking).<\/p>\n<p>On January 14, 2004, Mark Zuckerberg met with Cameron, Tyler, and Divya for the last time. During the meeting at Kirkland House, Mark expressed doubts about the viability of HarvardConnection.com. He said he was very busy with personal projects and school work and that he wouldn't be able to work on the site for a while. He blamed others for the site's delays.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He did not say that he was working on his own project and that he was not planning to complete the HarvardConnection site.<\/p>\n<p>After the meeting, Mark had another IM exchange with the friend above. He told her, in effect, that he had wimped out. He hadn't been able to break the news to Cameron and Tyler, in part, he said, because he was \"intimidated\" by them. He called them \"poor bastards.\"<\/p>\n<p>So then what happened?<\/p>\n<p>Three days earlier, on January 11, 2004, Mark had registered the domain THEFACEBOOK.COM.<\/p>\n<p>On February 4, he opened the site to Harvard students.<\/p>\n<p>On February 10, Cameron Winklevoss sent Mark a letter accusing him of breaching their agreement and stealing their idea.<\/p>\n<p>In late May, after going through two more developers, Cameron, Tyler and Divya launched HarvardConnection as ConnectU, a social network for 15 schools.<\/p>\n<p>On June 10, 2004, a commencement speaker mentioned the amazing popularity of Mark's site, thefacebook.com.<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 2004, Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time and soon received a $500,000 investment from Peter Thiel.<\/p>\n<p>In September 2004, HarvardConnection, now called ConnectU, sued Mark Zuckerberg and the now-incorporated \"Facebook\" for allegedly breaching their agreement and stealing their idea.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2008, Facebook and ConnectU agreed to settle the lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>In June 2008, ConnectU appealed the settlement in California's ninth district, accusing Facebook of trading its stock without disclosing material information. This appeal is on-going.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/the-65-million-question-5\">Continue --&gt;<\/a><\/h3>","uri":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/im-going-to-fuck-them-4"},{"name":"the-65-million-question-5","title":"The $65 million question","image":"4b90c0117f8b9a8f098d0200","left":150,"html":"<p><div class=\"image-container slide-image\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.businessinsider.com\/image\/4b90c0117f8b9a8f098d0200-400-300\/the-65-million-question.jpg\" alt=\"The $65 million question\" border=\"0\" class=\"slide-image\" \/><\/div>When we described the specifics of this story to Facebook, the company had the following comment:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"We&rsquo;re not going to debate the disgruntled litigants and anonymous sources who seek to rewrite Facebook&rsquo;s early&nbsp;history or embarrass Mark Zuckerberg with dated allegations. The unquestioned fact is that since leaving Harvard for&nbsp;Silicon Valley nearly six years ago, Mark has led Facebook's growth from a college website to a global service playing&nbsp;an important role in the lives of over 400 million people.\"<\/p>\n<p>On the latter point, we agree.&nbsp; What Mark Zuckerberg has accomplished with Facebook over the past six years has been nothing short of amazing.<\/p>\n<p>So, having revisited the founding of Facebook with additional information, what do we conclude?<\/p>\n<p>First, we have seen no evidence of any formal contract between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevosses in which Mark agreed to develop Harvard Connection.<\/p>\n<p>Second, any agreement the parties may have had--as well as most of the purported IMs and emails we have reviewed from the period--appear to have been at the level of, as Judge Ware described them, \"dorm-room chit-chat.\" (Albeit interesting and entertaining chit-chat.)<\/p>\n<p>Third, only a week after beginning development of Harvard Connection, which he referred to as \"the dating site,\" Mark had begun work on a separate project -- \"the facebook thing.\" Mark appears to have considered the products as competing for the attention of the same users, but he also appears to have regarded them as different in some key ways.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth -- and because of this foreseen competition -- Mark does appear to have intentionally strung along the Harvard Connection folks with the goal of making his project, thefacebook.com, have a more successful launch.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line, we haven't seen anything that makes us think that, whatever Mark did to the Harvard Connection folks, it was worth more than the $65 million they received in the lawsuit settlement.&nbsp; In fact, this seems like a huge sum of money considering that the entire dispute took place over two months in 2004 and that, in the six years since, Mark has built Facebook into a massive global enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>That said, in the course of our investigation, we also uncovered two additional anecdotes about Mark's behavior in Facebook's early days that are more troubling. These episodes -- an apparent hacking into the email accounts of Harvard Crimson editors using data obtained from Facebook logins, as well as a later hacking into ConnectU -- are described in detail here.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3\">How Mark Zuckerberg Hacked The Harvard Crimson Using Data From TheFacebook.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-connectu-2010-3\">How Mark Zuckerberg Hacked Into Rival ConnectU In The Summer Of 2004<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>","uri":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3\/the-65-million-question-5"}],

It always boils down to something along this line: "Hard work, persistence and integrity."<br/><br/>The last word is usually a lie put in to put pixie dust on their whole saga. Success usually involves the willingness to stab people in the back like Zuckerberg did. That's the unfortunate truth in business.</span>

That has created a casino culture, that generally doesn't apply itself without legal heritage to the IP.<br/><br/>Without addressing the capitalism mantra, I would say that other cultures, including many that are kicking our arse economically, don't operate this way.<br/><br/>Sure the idea is crucial, but the implementation (i.e. labor) needs to be respected to insure lasting success. Henry Ford understood this, I'm not so sure about corporate America currently.</span>

                                                <span class="comment-text">The truth is that Mark stole the idea and the software from the twins at Harvard after they hired him without a written agreement and thus had little protection against his theft.  The Harvard Alumni magazine did a very thorough story on this two years ago.  The twins hired Mark (but failed to protect themselves from his deviousness) because he had been suspended from Harvard from hacking into the Harvard computers to steal information on the freshman class -- they thought that meant he was a good programmer.  He made off with their software and their idea while promising to design their website only to never give them a line of code while deceiving them for months -- he left them hanging.  They sued too late to stop him.  For the first three years, Mark's business card showed his title as "I'm CEO Bitch!"  <br/><br/>Sadly, nice guys do often finish last  . . .  The investors don't care.</span>

Mark has done nothing wrong, their idea was lame and done to death before (yet, another, dating, site... yawwwn), his was almost interesting... pretty boring and yawnable technically, but different.<br/><br/>It is absurd that someone has a couple of coffee chats with a dev and then asks that all his subsequent work is theirs forever.  It might sound rude, but these guys are rock solid idiots for not contracting and writing down the idea.  It sounds more like a couple of people with 1/3rd of an idea and wanting a talented dev to do all the work for them.<br/><br/>This is sad.</span>

The connect U people did and that is the point. Today you can hire developers all over the world to make your idea happen, what Connect U tried to do and got shafted. I also agree that many people have ideas and never act  on them.<br/><br/>In one of my past companies founded 6 years before connectu was even a thought. Same concept. We had an a family friend intern, who went to an ivy league school trie to steal part of our idea. We fired him , took back the content, threatened legal action and to tell his parents (which was actually worse) as well as get him expelled. <br/><br/>Lucky enough at that time we were a funded startup with top lawyers and staff. <br/><br/>Zuckerberg might have taken the companie to were it is now, but so may have the connect u people as well. I think they deserved every penny they got if not more. Who knows how many similar stories are buried within facebook.<br/><br/>Also it's a shame that we can no longer trust people at their word.  I have done many deals with people on handshakes, mostly good a few bad seeds but then you learn not to ever do work with those people again.<br/><br/>karma can be a bitch.</span>

They obviously weren't developers/programmers.  Sounds like they wanted someone else to work out all the hard details and then take the credit for the whole project.<br/><br/>Also, while I don't think that facebook regards privacy (the very notion is not very private), I don't see how Mr. Zuckerberg's being a very good hacker is actually a negative thing.  He has an idea of what people can do to mess with the site.  Meanwhile, the ConnectU folks had no clue about how to protect their users, even allowing Mr. Zuckerberg access for many months when he was not working on the site.  <br/><br/>The ConnectU folks obviously didn't have a clue about what they were doing.  $65 million sounds like a lot.</span>

It's a great read, but the dialogue in the IMs seems silly and fake. The point is that even if these are anonymous sources, one wants to know where the info came from so that we can access what their agenda might be.</span>

                                                <span class="comment-text">@Henry Blodget No, the object of the editor and reporter is to report FACTS -- if the sources can't be confirmed by a number of different people then it shouldn't be printed. I've worked as a journalist and in pr and "in general" is NOT how it's done..this is blog style reporting at best. If a source has an agenda, then that's clearly stated and worked into the story. It's like selling the sizzle as opposed to the steak. Despite these omission this is an interesting hypothesis.</span>

Its easy to talk about an idea, but building the right product, marketing it, etc, is damn hard.  The Connect U guys could have built a better product, got their idea to market faster - they had the opportunity but were simply not as good.<br/><br/>Should Zuckerberg have been more upfront and say:  "hey, I'm working on something somewhat related...you guys should find someone else."?  Absolutely.  Sounds like he wimped out.  But, he still out executed them.  And $65M for an 'idea' is pretty good - Connect U guys should be ecstatic.</span>

The moral here is obviously not that the ConnectU guys would be in Zuckerberg's shoes if he hadn't screwed them. The execution is, as you say, everything. After all, even if you leave the ConnectU stuff out entirely, there was nothing innovative about the basic idea.<br/><br/>But that these things weren't the reason he succeeded doesn't excuse them. The way he treated those guys, and the two hacking incidents are a very big deal.</span>

You naively assume that coming together would have resulted in a product every bit as good as Facebook, if not better.  How many of Zuckerberg (and team's) ideas would have been blocked by these ConnectU guys?  How many disagreements leading to indecision that would have wasted valuable time? How many compromises on Zuckerberg's vision? Their vision wasn't that similar to Facebook's.<br/><br/>One key phrase to note above is "Stanford has something like that internally."  They weren't the only ones, either. There were a few of these in various forms on and around colleges, building on ideas inspired by Friendster.<br/><br/>The way things worked out was the best thing ever for the ConnectU folks. They most likely would have created something that wouldn't have taken off at Harvard, not to mention worldwide.</span>

But is it "theft"?  If they didn't have a formal agreement or contract to protect themselves / each other, and no patents / trade secrets / etc were stolen, then probably not.  So the $65 million is a very generous settlement.<br/><br/>Like others have said, everything is in the execution.  If the Winklevosses were serious about the project and its potential to be an actual company some day, they would NOT have sat around letting their programmer string them along for months, whether he was lying or not.  They were asleep at the switch.  It also appears that the project was a team of four where only one of them (Zuckerberg) was doing actual work?</span>

I agree with (what I think is ) the conclusion that nothing illegal went on here.  $65 million bucks to the twins for discussing an idea in a dorm room sounds like a very fair price.   <br/><br/> Zuck sounds like a typical dirt bag dweeb geek of the modern age.  Doesn't mean he can't get rich.  Plenty of dirt bags are.</span>

A written contract is NOT required in the USA. Did they have a 'meeting of the minds'? We know he had access to their development site, said he was working on the code, did some work, had update meetings, etc.  That is all undisputed.  He even wrote to his buddy that the twins' promotion plans were impressive.  So all of them believed they were working together and he purposefully continued that charade to shaft them and steal their ideas.<br/><br/>As for all of you Americans who think ideas are unimportant, I have news for you.  Americans don't "make" things anymore.  All we have are ideas. When you diminish intellectual property you weaken our nation's future.</span>

Should Zynga go it alone by unplugging from facebook which they should... facebook could find itself up a creek. <br/><br/>frankly its ironic that any status other than engaged/married will lend itself to a torrent of dating site ads in facebook in the right hand side... so I the majorify of fb revenue comes from match.com and the like for ads its unlikely that fb will modify its infrastructure to compete more effectively with the dating sites...</span>

                                                <span class="comment-text"><br/>Just today I almost pulled out what remains of my hair trying to understand the 'design' of the applications settings page.<br/><br/>First of all the applications link that appears on the "home" page takes you to a list of applications but then provides no edit or delete links next to each displayed item. Why would I want to see the apps and not want to edit them???<br/><br/>To actually edit them you need to go to the mentioned "applications settings" by using the old "account" drop down arrow, there you will be attacked with way too many options for applications, you can view ones that have the right to post on your wall, others that have other access (how they got this varied access in the first place is interesting)...in any event I click on the "allowed to post" drop down option to filter the applications and notice that instead of having a simple check box for un-selecting the item (the context of the page already asserts the filter type) there is a link for "settings" an "x" to delete the damn thing and something else...so why didn't they add these links on the more accessible "applications" tab that shows on the "home" page? It's just senseless.<br/></span>

I would love to see someone write about the following: <br/><br/>1. How do advertisers actually feel about facebook? Are they getting ROI? Is it just a huge mob with no value as some posters out here have stated? <br/>2. Where is all this revenue coming from? We know that zynga in responsible for a huge chunk, which is very suspect...where is the rest? <br/>3. of this 400 million users...how many are actual users? The ones that are posting, playing, etc. (I know from my own personal exp that alot of friends (30% or so) I have signed-up and never really did anything with it. <br/><br/>as a side note...this was posted tonight form a friend that is a serial poster on Fbook "Is it just me or has facebook "jumped the shark"? Kinda bores me now...." 17 people agreed in one form or another about how it's "sucking or lame"</span>

I hardly ever actually visit the site. Everythign you click on you have to be vigilant it's not someone trying to scam you, or trying to get you to annoy your fiends by scamming them too.<br/><br/>The only thing it has that is of any value is the place many of my friends and family actually hang out. If a better system comes along, FB will go away like firendster, AOL  and myspace before it.</span>

                                                <span class="comment-text">@JD: Yes, generally useless is how I would describe Facebook.<br/><br/>I keep in touch via, phone calls, texts, chat, and email-- I don't want a separate messaging service. <br/><br/>Facebook is useful for spying on girls in college, however I graduated a couple years ago so that no longer appeals to me.<br/><br/>Facebook is also useful for career networking, however LinkedIn is a much better option in that category.<br/><br/>The only thing I see my friends consistently using facebook to do is post and look at pictures of themselves and friends. Which i guess is pretty cool, just not something i'm that interested in.</span>

The Harvard Connections people should have acquired some sort of patent or written and signed document to ensure that Mark could not use their idea in anyway. The fact that they did not think ahead makes them losers in the real world. <br/><br/>Mark was well in his place to work on facebook. I think he should have just quit and worked on facebook but regardless, it's his business mind that got him so far. Sometimes you have to be less than ethical. So he stole an idea, somewhat, Gates does it all the time and no one complains. He just knew how to market the idea better just like Microsoft. Simple as that.</span>

I've never met an honest businessperson.<br/><br/>The only way to succeed is by stepping on other people. Then keep stepping on them so you don't get taken down. That's just how it works on a logical level. More money in your pocket means less money in someone else's, because money doesn't create itself.</span>

It sounds more like an article intended to slander than clarify truth. There is a big difference between purported and reported. All the "quotations" from the supposed IM's are only "purported" meaning they haven't been verified as being actual IM's that were sent. Regardless of whether there is any truth in this article or not, it still sounds more like a slander article to me than anything else. If the author's wanted to "clarify" the truth, they would have taken a more neutral stand point than what they did in the writings of it.</span>

If you really believe in your idea and your developer is giving you the go-around hire someone else<br/>2. An idea is an idea is an idea - even my son could come up with idea of socially connecting his classmates through a website (with myspace and friendster already there what was so unique about their idea?) - it's vague and ridiculous - building a product, technology and the business around it is far more complex than people give it credit for<br/>3. They got paid 65 MM$ for talking about an idea and discussing potential features?<br/><br/>Re: IM"s and emails I wouldn't question those - 18 year old kids talk a lot out of social pressure.. I think the hacking incidents sound more questionable - paints the picture of someone without ethics - but why am I not surprised? We have sooo many role models over the past 60 years that are ethical champions - right?</span>

However I fail to see how they concluded that he started facebook one week after Harvard Connection guys told him their idea.    He could have been working on the facebook from before, and when Harvard Connection guys told him of their idea -- he first thought "its different in some way, so let me make it", and then slowly realized over a period of time, that there is a huge overlap. So he could have just told them -- go make it yourself -- but then he thought these guys had marketing muscle -- and he though harvard connection would stump facebook for this reason. So he had no correct way of going forward.    <br/><br/>His situation was like  -- your competitors approach you for making their website, and when you have just started working on your own!<br/><br/>Thats a tricky position to be in -- the cleanest way would have been to simply ask them to look elsewhere the first time they approached him -- but he couldnt do this because:<br/>1. He thought these guys have more marketing muscle, so they have a better chance of success than him.<br/>2. He thought the projects had a different approach, so they were different in some key ways.</span>

Itd be one thing if he was just stringing them along, but no, he was deliberately sabotaging their efforts after he stole their idea by hacking into their site and messing with subscription setting etc.<br/><br/>I hate Facebook anyway, it sucks and so does Zuckerberg.<br/>I do not care what he has done in the last 6 years, the 1st year is the most crucial and like I said...<br/>ConnectU could be where Facebook is today had Zuckerberg not been a slithering pile of snake shit.<br/><br/>Oh and btw Business Insider, your website sucks for navigating to back to your homepage screwing up people trying to leave comments.

They have to pay capital gains, repay the legal fee's (around $6,000,000), a piece of the settlement, etc.  By the time the dust settles, it's not as much as you think.  I have knowledge of this, as I know the family.  Did Mark learn ideas from the original gang....sure.  Did he already have a foundation for the site...sure.  Could some of the new ideas give Facebook the extra edge to gain market share....maybe?  So, at the end of the day, Facebook scored w/the settlement.  Close the chapter, move on.  Less negative PR is better for new investors and customers.</span>

I don't debate the value of off-the-record information, but the "purported" in "one purported IM discussion" undercuts the credibility of this story.</span>
