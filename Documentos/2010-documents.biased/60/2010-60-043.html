<meta name="description" content="As we did last year, we have gone back through our archives and picked out some of the most noteworthy social media items we have covered since 2009 began. Now that 2009 is almost over, it was worth going&nbsp; back and seeing what all has happened. If you come across missing items, please feel free to share them in the comments.

That will only serve to make the piece more comprehensive for future readers. &nbsp;" />

<p>Of course, there has been much more that has happened over the year in social media. I think it might be close to impossible to cover every single thing.
