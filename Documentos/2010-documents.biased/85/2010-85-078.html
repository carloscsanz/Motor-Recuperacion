						<p>The <a href="SKOS_July2008.htm">Sharing Vocabularies on the Web via SKOS</a> event, the third ISKO UK KOnnecting KOmmunities event organized in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.slais.ucl.ac.uk/">School of Library Archives and Information Studies </a> at UCL, took place on Monday 21 July and was attended by 94 participants. 
							<br>
							<br>
					  The programme included five themes presented by eight speakers from the forefront of SKOS development and implementation: <strong>Alistair Miles</strong>, <strong>Antoine Isaac</strong>, <strong>Stella Dextre Clarke</strong>, <strong>Leonard Will</strong>, <strong>Nicolas Cochard</strong>, <strong>Ceri Binding</strong>, <strong>Douglas Tudhope</strong> and <strong>Bernard Vatant</strong>.<br>
					  <br>
					  The afternoon represented a refreshing step forward in thinking through the more powerful application of controlled vocabularies. A lively discussion enabled all to develop their own thinking on the opportunities to share and even generate new information through the combination of linked information resources and the vocabularies supporting them. <br>
					  <br>
					    Presentations  are now available at the <a href="SKOS_July2008.htm">event</a>'s page, and recordings of the talks will be available shortly. </p>

				  <p>ISKOUK held its second KOKO (KOnnecting KOmmunities) event from 14:00 - 20:00 on November 5th entitled <em>Ranganathan Revisited: Facets for the future </em>. The intention was to explore the current status of faceted classification from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. The event was sponsored by <a href="http://factiva.com">Factiva from Dow Jones</a> and the venue was provided by the <a href="http://www.slais.ucl.ac.uk/">School of Library, Archive and Information Studies (SLAIS) at University College London (UCL)</a>.

					  <p>The next ISKO UK<strong> <a href="cc.htm">KOnnect KOmmunities</a></strong>  event entitled <strong>&quot;<a href="kokonov2007.htm">Ranganathan revisted: Facets for the Future</a></strong>&quot; will be held on <strong>5th November 2007</strong>, at University College London.<br>
					    <br> 
					    S. R. Ranganathan was the Indian librarian and academic who, in the 1930s, developed the theory of faceted classification. Faceted classification is an approach to presenting and organizing knowledge based on the identification of fundamental subject categories (?facets?) that allows the combination of relevant values from one or more facets to define a compound subject with great precision.
  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At ISKO UK?s KOKO event on November 5th, theory and practice will be juxtaposed in a stimulating rapprochement long overdue. Speakers from academia will ask whether faceted classification is not in fact, the paradigm for effective retrieval and discovery of knowledge, and will examine the relative merits of a number of different approaches. Independent software developers, Jan Wyllie and Simon Eaton, will talk about and demonstrate faceted classification as an intelligence analysis tool. Factiva, market leaders in business information provision, will demonstrate how faceted classification combined with visualization and user interaction lies behind their award-winning information services. Netherlands-based company Aduna will present their open-source facet-driven enterprise search solution AutoFocus, followed by an opportunity for speakers and attendees to mingle in a networking session supplemented by wine and nibbles provided courtesy of Factiva.<br>
                        <br>
