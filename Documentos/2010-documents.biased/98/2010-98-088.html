                		<td>Continued focus on operational excellence remains a key tenet of the Group strategy around
delivering a superior client experience, and during the year we were involved in multiple
initiatives aimed at further enhancing this experience.<br>
<br>

The key areas of client demand in FY2009 from a technology perspective have been around
network optimisation, visual communications, IP telephony, virtualisation and consolidation of
data centres and Windows 7 for Microsoft. Clients have focused on maintaining and optimising
their existing IT infrastructure as capital budgets reduced. We have also benefited from a
general trend towards standardisation and centralisation of IT to reduce costs and centralise
control. This trend provides us with good managed services opportunities as multinational
clients consolidate services suppliers and move to partners that can support multi-vendor
technologies on a multinational basis.<br>
<br>

Within our client segments, we experienced weakness in demand in our top 30 global clients,
which make up 15% (18% in FY2008) of revenues, particularly in global financial services
clients in North America and Asia. Financial services revenues overall were, nevertheless,
relatively stable, with a strong performance in the regional and domestic financial services
client base. We reacted to the slow-down in spend in our global client sector by broadening
our exposure to clients in the large regional enterprise and commercial segments of the
market where we saw relatively better opportunities.<br>
<br>

The service provider vertical was quite resilient and our revenues increased due to our
focus on services rather than technology fulfilment in this vertical. We have benefited from
subcontracting opportunities in large service provider clients who have partnered with us
to execute global contracts. We have also secured good business through partnering with
second tier and mobile service providers.<br>
<br>

The public sector vertical has been another area of focus and one in which we have performed
well in FY2009. Our public sector business has been particularly strong in Australia and South
Africa. We have also seen good contract wins across the Americas, Europe and Asia. We are
planning further investment during FY2010 in this vertical across our regions.&nbsp;</td>

                <tr>
                		<td><h1>People and culture</h1></td>
                		</tr>
                <tr>
                		<td>Dimension Data has always believed that our people and culture are key differentiators in the
market and essential to the success of the Group. We work hard at cultivating a winning, high
performance culture. The success of our efforts has been reflected in widespread recognition
from industry leaders and the winning of a number of exceptional awards. These include the
Australia and New Zealand Hewitt Best Employer for 2009 for Express Data, a ranking of 9th
place in the Corporate Research Foundation's 2009/2010 Best Employers in Middle East and
Africa as well as 9th position for Datacraft India in Dataquest's 'Top 10 Best IT Employers in
2009' award.<br>
<br>

The total number of employees across the Group was 11,032 at year end which is flat on the
prior year. Whilst our people and culture strategy is a key cornerstone of our Group strategy,
it was necessary to respond to the prevailing economic environment during the year. Our
approach was to take rapid action early in the year to reduce costs where necessary due
to a reduced demand. In contrast, we also invested and sought to maximise opportunities
for growth wherever possible. This dual approach resulted in head count reductions in some
geographies and businesses, and growth in others.<br>
<br>
In addition, we invested in building people strength during the course of the year, adding to
our Microsoft skills organically and through the Teksys acquisition, and increasing head count in
Internet Solutions and our SI business through acquisitions in Angola, Mozambique and Australia.
During the year the Group made a number of investments in enabling, developing and
retaining excellence in our people. We deployed Leading Talent, a tailored programme for
all line managers aimed at further developing our key leaders in the Group. We continued to
drive the Dimension Data Job Framework project, which helps employees identify and plot
their optimal career paths. With the recent stabilisation that we have seen in some of our end
markets and in anticipation of some growth in FY2010, we are once again looking at modest
additions to our key technical and sales skills in select areas of the business.&nbsp;</td>

keeping our go-to-market strategies aligned. Key differentiators for Dimension Data are
the breadth of technical talent within the Group and its unparalleled ability to execute with
multiple partners.<br>
<br>

Dimension Data received a record number of awards and accolades over the past
year, which are testament to our partners' recognition of the breadth of the Group's
technical skills and experience. Key awards included Cisco Technology Excellence
Partner along with 19 other Cisco awards, and Microsoft Global Partner of the Year in
the three categories. In addition, we won awards from HP, Avaya, Tandberg, VMWare,
BlueCoat, McAfee, Symantec, EMC, RSA and Nuance. Dimension Data achieved 21st
place in Business Week's Info Tech 100 list, which recognises top-performing technology
companies across the globe.&nbsp;</td>

<br>

The continued execution of our services strategy will be a priority for our SI business.
We have made tremendous progress over the past few years and are excited about our
prospects as we continue the journey. During the year we embarked upon a services
acceleration programme with five key projects aimed at further enhancing our global
services offerings. We will continue to invest in systems, processes and people to
enhance our services offerings for our clients and improve our execution capabilities.<br>
<br>

Our regional SI businesses are at varying levels of maturity along our services led strategy
and we still have a way to go before our objective of offering a full lifecycle of services in
all geographies is realised. It is however, clear to us that our services strategy is working
and that we are on track to derive further benefits from its ongoing implementation in the
years ahead.<br>

We constantly seek to align our go-to-market offerings with current and upcoming
market trends, to ensure that we offer our clients solutions relevant to their business
issues. From a technology market trend perspective, we will look to invest further in our
capabilities and offerings in the network (as the core business infrastructure enabler), unified communications and collaboration (including visual technologies) and virtualisation.
For medium term opportunities we will be expanding our competence in cloud and
service based infrastructure models.<br>
<br>

Internet Solutions is well positioned to benefit from market trends, and to build on the
strong market position established over the years. Internet Solutions was awarded
two telecommunications licences in South Africa which provide additional market
opportunity. We have also embarked upon the application process to acquire licensed
wireless spectrum, which would enable us to connect to our clients using both fixed
and wireless links.<br>
<br>

We will continue to invest in Internet Solutions to secure our desired positioning as Africa's
leading internet-technology based service provider, offering a superior customer service
experience. Our strategic priorities are, firstly, to invest in the required people, processes and
capital expenditure required to secure the growth opportunity. We will also invest to enhance
the customer service experience and we will expand our existing services offerings. Finally,
we will continue to invest to secure lower input costs, such as our acquisition this year of local
fibre capacity to service our clients, and our commitment during the year to a new submarine
cable bringing enhanced bandwidth capacity to the continent.<br>
<br>

The Group's profitable growth strategy will largely be driven by organic growth in existing
markets. We still have significant opportunity to increase our market share in existing
geographies and we intend to expand into several cities in Brazil and China next year. We will,
in addition, target two types of acquisitions - the first to expand our footprint and the second
where we need additional skills to enhance the Group's IP and hasten our route to market.
<br>
<br>
In addition to the purchase of the minority shareholding in Datacraft Asia, we made a few
small acquisitions during the year. In Africa, we completed an acquisition in Mozambique
and are currently in the process of completing two further acquisitions whereby we will be
expanding our capability and presence in Angola and Morocco.<br>
<br>

In November 2008 we made a strategic investment in Bluefire, a Sydney based IT services
company which provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services. In February 2009 we
purchased Teksys, a UK based Microsoft infrastructure and licencing services business
which has given us scale and Large Account Reseller status in Europe.&nbsp;</td>

                		<td>A key factor behind the resilience that Dimension Data has shown in the face of the challenging
economic environment is the Group's high performance culture, one in which our people are
consistently encouraged to maximise opportunity whatever the prevailing market conditions.
In addition, our chosen positioning in the global Information Technology market and the
execution of our strategy have been successful.<br>
<br>
 We believe that Dimension Data is positioned in the sweet spot of IT and communications
spend, and that the trends that have been driving superior growth in the Group over the
past few years, have the momentum to continue to drive growth into the medium and longer
term. Our network centric offerings are vital for our clients to be able to operate effectively in
today's IP and convergence powered environment, where the network is increasingly the core
platform for all forms of IT and telecommunications. Our strengthening position in areas such
as unified communications, collaboration, virtualisation and managed services position us for
medium term growth. In the longer term, market developments such as cloud computing and
services based models such as IaaS, provide additional opportunities for growth.<br>
<br>
The opportunity to deliver on Dimension Data's profitable growth strategy, which is premised
on both growth and leverage, lies across all our businesses. The opportunity to drive the
SI margin higher lies in four factors. The first of these is the ongoing effective rollout of our
services strategy; the second lies in harnessing the benefits of additional scale in a number
of key markets; the third involves securing additional efficiency improvements; and the
fourth relates to recovery in a few under-performing geographies. The low working capital
requirements of the SI business make its return on assets the highest of all of the Group's
businesses.<br>
<br>

We are optimistic that the ongoing deregulation of the telecommunications market in
South Africa and the growth opportunities on the African continent will provide significant
opportunities for Internet Solutions.<br>
<br>

Plessey is well placed to benefit from the opening up of the African continent to growth
in telecommunication services and we remain confident that the business has attractive
medium term growth prospects. Express Data is a premier value added distributor with solid
prospects.<br>
<br>

We are encouraged by the recent stabilisation in our end markets, however much uncertainty
remains over the resilience of the global recovery. We anticipate that the market segments
in which Dimension Data operates will perform better in FY2010 and that the Group will be
able to deliver modest constant currency revenue growth. Dimension Data is well placed
to capitalise on long term market trends. Growth in excess of prevailing market rates and
medium term operating leverage remain our key financial objectives.&nbsp;</td>
