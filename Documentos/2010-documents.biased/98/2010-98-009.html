                        Microsoft's newest <i><b>desktop</b></i> operating system for
                        both consumers and businesses. Over the past few years,
                        Microsoft has been building and supporting two
                        completely separate versions of Windows. Windows
                        95/98/Me was designed for consumers with an emphasis on
                        ease of use, compatibility, and multimedia capabilities.
                        At the same time, Microsoft created Windows NT for businesses
                        who need security, and reliability. (NT version 5.0 is
                        now called Windows 2000). The Win9x and WinNT versions
                        of Windows may look the same, but they have a very
                        different code base, and don't use the same drivers.
                        Windows XP builds on the stability and strength of the
                        Windows NT/2000 Operating System, while incorporating
                        the usability of Windows 95/98. Although Microsoft has referred
                        to Windows XP as a merging of the code base between
                        Windows 95/98 and Windows NT/2000, it has a lot more in
                        common with Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) and is sometimes
                        referred to as NT 5.1&nbsp;</font></td>

                        be released in two
                        different versions: Windows XP Professional (for
                        businesses) and Windows XP Home Edition (for consumers.)
                        Although the kernel for both operating systems are the
                        same, the Home Edition is a stripped down version of the
                        Professional version. Its main focus is the consumer
                        home PC market, and it is designed to be easier to use.
                        Much of its interface assumes that you have a full time
                        internet connection and that your primary online
                        activities are browsing, e-mail, instant messaging, listening to MP3 and
                        online music, and sharing photos and other digital media
                        on the web. XP Professional is designed for business and
                        advanced home users who need security and enhanced
                        networking capabilities. It looks and feels just like
                        Windows 2000 once you drop the XP color scheme and
                        choose &quot;Windows classic.&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/">Windows
                        XP Media Center Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/">Windows
                        XP Tablet PC Edition</a> are special versions of the
                        operating system designed for specific hardware. You can
                        only get these versions when you purchase a the
                        specialized hardware directly from the manufacturer.</font></td>

                        Professional and XP Home Edition share the same kernel
                        (the &quot;guts&quot; of the operating system), and this
                        kernel is based on the Windows 2000 operating system.
                        The differences between them are in the level of
                        security they provide, networking capabilities, and
                        advanced features. For business users, Windows XP
                        Professional is very similar to Windows 2000 in its
                        feature set. XP Professional supports multiple
                        processors, multiple monitors (up to 9), <a href="../activedirectory/grpolicy.htm">Group

                        program, and advanced networking capabilities (such as
                        IPSec.) <b> All</b> of these features are missing from XP Home
                        Edition. Another important distinction between the two
                        versions is that XP Home Edition cannot join a Windows
                        NT/2000/2003 domain. If you wish to network with other PC's
                        in your home or office, you must be part of a
                        workgroup.&nbsp;If you're a &quot;power user&quot;
                        purchasing Windows XP for your personal workstation,
                        Windows XP Professional is a better choice than Home
                        Edition, if you can afford the price difference.&nbsp;Windows
                        XP Professional is also more <a href="../articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm">secure</a>
                        than Home Edition, which is an important consideration

                        Microsoft has added a host of new features to both
                        versions of Windows XP, but nothing that appears to be
                        absolutely compelling
                        for business users. One of the new features called
                        &quot;Fast User Switching&quot; allows to to run two separate
                        logged in sessions at once. This allows a user to do everyday work
                        such as e-mail using a non-privileged user account, and
                        then run an Administrative session at the same time
                        without rebooting or resorting to the &quot;Run As&quot;
                        command. This also allows you to quickly log onto any
                        users workstation and make administrative changes
                        without logging them off. The remote assistance feature
                        of XP can also help reduce support costs by allowing
                        your Help Desk staff to interact with a user's PC over
                        the network. XP's built in ZIP compression support can
                        also save your company a lot of money in licensing fees
                        if you are currently using a third party utility such as
                        WinZIP.</font></td>

                        that RAM is a larger bottleneck than CPU
                        speed. (i.e. Adding 256Mb of RAM will give you a better
                        performance boost than upgrading your processor speed by
                        200 - 300 Mhz). Windows XP is also designed to take advantage of
                        Intel's Pentium 4 instruction set (SSE/SSE2), so you'll
                        see slightly better performance on the newer processors.

                        a registry key that disables activation. Microsoft made
                        the existence of this registry key public to its
                        technical beta testers telling them where it was and how
                        to set it to disable activation, and included it as a
                        testing tool. Some users who are suspicious of the product
                        activation feature have decided to use this tool, but it
                        is likely that Microsoft could release an update that

                        and Windows 2000, the upgrade should be pretty smooth.
                        Microsoft says that over 90 percent of Windows 2000/NT

                        in the past three years already work on XP. Notably, one
                        of the applications that doesn't work is Novell Client
                        32 V4.80. This incompatibility will have an impact for
                        business users who are still running in a Novell
                        environment, but I'm confident that Novell will probably
                        release a new client within the next few months.&nbsp; For

                        hardware devices that aren't compatible and are waiting
                        for updated drivers. These include multi-function

                        your hardware manufacturer to see if they've posted new

                        write XP compatible drivers for their products - not Microsoft's. In fact, not supporting a new operating
                        system is a tactic used by some manufacturers in order
                        to get you to upgrade your current product. Microsoft
                        released an avalanche of technical details, driver
                        guidelines, and beta software to manufacturers a full
                        year before Windows XP shipped in order to give them as
                        much as lead time as possible. In a random survey of legacy
                        (pre-2001) printer and scanner drivers available for XP,
                        we noticed a definite support trend that favored the
                        higher end (and higher profit) devices and left entry
                        level models (or those commonly given away with Win95/98
                        PC's) unsupported. It's really not that hard to write a
                        driver (or update software to work with Windows XP) but
                        some manufacturers just refuse to do it. You should
                        always check the status of your existing hardware before

                        more stable than the 5 year old code for Windows 9x (including Windows Me).
                        However, when you compare Windows XP with Windows 2000
                        they're pretty evenly matched. On systems with +600Mhz processors
                        and 512Kb of RAM, our XP installations run just a hair
                        faster than the same systems running Windows 2000.&nbsp;XP
                        also has a definite advantage over Windows 2000 on
                        Pentium 4 processors.</font></td>

                        security), and is on par with Windows 2000. There has been

                        Assistance features which can allow another person

                        however there are several adequate safeguards in place

                        and so far hackers haven't figured out a way to exploit
                        it. Another controversial topic is Microsoft's use of
                        full raw sockets API&nbsp; in Windows XP that could
                        theoretically allow hackers to use XP workstations as

                        two most frequent complaints about Windows XP is the new
                        interface and Windows Product
                        Activation. I personally hate the new
                        &quot;Playskool&quot; interface. I half expect a purple
                        dinosaur to pop up and give me instructions. (<i>Shudder</i>)
                        Thankfully, a few mouse clicks will change it back to
                        the &quot;classic&quot; interface. The next thing we
                        hated was Windows Product Activation. Although the web
                        activation was painless and took only a few seconds, it
                        still feels a bit like &quot;Big Brother&quot; and makes
                        us a little uncomfortable. We also had mixed reviews about
                        the &quot;clean&quot;
                        desktop. On the default XP setup, there is only one icon on the
                        desktop - the recycle bin. This is a welcome departure
                        from the multitude of AOL icons and other junk
                        cluttering the Win9x desktop, but over the years we've
                        become accustomed to using the &quot;My Computer&quot;,
                        &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; and &quot;My
                        Documents&quot; desktop icons. (Fortunately, you can get
                        these back with a few mouse clicks) Fast user switching
                        was a disappointment since it doesn't work if you're
                        logged into a Windows 2000 domain. (We haven't tested it
                        using an NT 4.0 domain). On the plus side, we like
                        the built in support for compressed files, the Help
                        system is vastly improved (it even provides hyperlinks to
                        related TechNet articles), the support for digital
                        cameras and scanners is excellent, and there other
                        several smaller &quot;features&quot; that are useful to
                        administrators. For example, we like having the ability to
                        automatically synchronize the time on our laptops using
                        an internet web server when we aren't logged into the
                        domain, and we like the that XP preloads popular printer drivers
                        into the default installation so you won't need to
                        provide your XP installation CD every time you need to
                        print to a new printer.&nbsp;Overall, we <i>like</i>
                        Windows XP as a desktop operating system. To borrow a
                        phrase, it's a small step up from Windows 2000
                        Professional, and a giant leap from Windows 95/98/Me</font></td>

                        Windows XP preloaded rather than try to upgrade the
                        hardware and OS on an older system.</font> <font size="2" face="Arial">Businesses and power
                        users that are already running Windows 2000 will

                        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The general user response
                        based on feedback and newsgroup postings is mixed. On a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/software/0-806340-1218-6534881.html">CNET
                        forum</a>, over 7,000 users where evenly split on their
                        reviews of XP Home Edition. 54% liked it, 46% hated it.
                        XP Professional <a href="http://www.cnet.com/software/0-806340-1218-6534868.html">faired
                        a little better</a> with 68% positive and 32% negative
                        user reviews We spent a few days reading hundreds of these
                        complaints, and noticed that a majority aren't
                        really legitimate issues with XP. People expect the
                        operating system to stay stable no matter how poorly
                        third party software is written. They expect XP to be
                        100% compatible with cheap or out of date hardware, and blame
                        Microsoft for the lack of drivers. They expect all programs
                        written for Windows 95/98/Me to work on XP. And if they
                        buy a new system with Windows XP preloaded on it, and it
                        crashes, they blame Microsoft and not the OEM's crappy
                        hardware configuration. These are the same issues that
                        have been raised for every Windows release since Win95.
                        While being completely crash proof regardless of the
                        abuse the operating system is subjected to is a lofty goal for any
                        operating system, it's a bit unrealistic. </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Windows
                        XP is certainly not perfect, it's not crash proof, and it's
                        not compatible with every piece of hardware and
                        software. But it is a vast improvement over Win95/98/Me
                        and Windows NT 4.0 in terms of ease of use, security,
                        stability, and performance. XP Professional is also on par
                        with Windows 2000 Professional in these areas, but
                        easier to use.&nbsp;If you're concerned about
                        compatibility with your old software or hardware, you
                        may wish to consider dual booting Windows XP with your
                        older operating system, using <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a>,
                        using a <a href="http://www.genica.com/">swappable hard
                        drive bay</a>, or simply keeping your old PC up and
                        running for a while and running Windows XP on a new PC.</font>
