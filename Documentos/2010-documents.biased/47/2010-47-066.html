        <p><span class="text-bold">Karen Borgnes keeps Pacific Aero Tech flying high  by focusing on its niche of refurbishing aircraft windows</span><br />
          <span class="text-emphasis">Puget Sound Business Journal </span><span class="text-bold"><br />
          </span>November 26, 1999<span class="text-bold"> <br />
          <br />
            </span>When Karen Borgnes wrote a  personal check to buy half of Pacific Aero Tech Inc. at liquidation prices nine  years ago, she knew virtually nothing about the aircraft window industry, and  she'd never run her own business. </p>
        <p> Since then she's built the Kent company into one of the most vigorous in  its field, with major aircraft customers scattered across North   America.</p>
        <p> &quot;I don't think there  will ever be a time when I'm not in aviation. It gets under your skin,&quot;  she said. &quot;Our parts are all over the world, and I get a kick out of  that.&quot; </p>
        <p> Pacific Aero Tech has 15  employees and $4.3 million in annual revenues. While her company's size seems  contrary to the consolidation sweeping the aerospace industry, Borgnes has kept  Pacific Aero Tech competitive by staying fiercely focused on her niche, and by  matching the biggest companies in capabilities.</p>
        <p> &quot;She's an independent  company that has state-of-the-art equipment, and everything is done by  machine,&quot; said Mary Phifer, manager of technical purchasing for Reno Air  in Reno, Nev.,  which was recently purchased by American Airlines. &quot;They turn out a very  high-quality product at a very reasonable price.&quot; </p>
        <p> The crystal-clear windows  airline passengers look through while at 35,000 feet don't remain crystal clear  without effort. After about two years in the sky the acrylic window panes become  scratched and marred by the rigors of high-speed flight, and must be  refurbished. Pacific Aero Tech is one of the few companies in the world that  does the work. </p>
        <p> Pacific's warehouse is  packed with $1 million in aircraft windows, some refurbished, others waiting  for an order before they're cleaned up. The work is done by polishing and  grinding machines, including a pricey diamond-tipped device that can delicately  mill away scarred surface plastic, leaving a perfect surface to be polished.  The finished windows are jewel-like, covered by sheets of protective paper. </p>
        <p> As a secondary line of  business Pacific Aero Tech refurbishes electronic avionics equipment made by  Gables Engineering Inc., in Coral    Gables. Fla.,  although that only accounts for 20 percent of revenue. </p>
        <p> Gables recently winnowed  its repair facilities down to three from five, but Pacific Aero Tech made the  cut.</p>
        <p> &quot;For such a small  shop, they give really great support to us and to Boeing,&quot; said Kevin  Ryan, Gables' director of customer services. &quot;Karen is quite happy keeping  it the size it is. It's an incredibly competitive market, but reputation  matters a lot in this business.&quot; </p>
        <p> What Borgnes didn't know  about aircraft windows when she bought the company with partner Hugo Flinn, now  an Irish banker, she did know about financial management and team building.  These have been the secrets of her success. She has a degree in accounting and  also an MBA, and she's worked for several major local companies, including  Arthur Young and Food Services of America. </p>
        <p> She started to turn toward  running her own business fresh out of accounting school, when she was helping  write the initial business plan for Immunex Corp. as an employee of Arthur  Young in 1981.</p>
        <p> &quot;It didn't take me  long to get the idea it was a heck of a lot more fun to create history than  audit history,&quot; she said. </p>
        <p> She moved on Esterline  Corp. subsidiary Korry Electronics and then Food Services of America, where she  did risk analysis, financial analysis and worked on mergers and acquisitions.  Then in 1990 she was laid off as part of a restructuring at Food Services, and  found herself wondering what was next. </p>
        <p> When a former colleague  called and offered her a job with a local aerospace supplier called Pacific  Aviation Group as controller, at first she was dubious because she'd been  thinking about starting her own computer company. But when she visited the  place, she was hooked.</p>
        <p> &quot;The first time I  walked through a warehouse of airplane parts it was like cupid, a bow and  arrow. I just loved it,&quot; she said. </p>
        <p> But then things got tough.  It turned out subsidiary Pacific Aero Support had been selling faulty aerospace  parts before she had been hired. Borgnes suddenly found herself in the middle  of a major investigation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal  Aviation Administration. She also was appointed Pacific Aviation Group vice  president and general manager, even though she was tempted to leave and go to  another industry. The former owners were jailed.</p>
        <p> &quot;The only reason I  didn't quit was I was pregnant, and it's hard to interview for a senior  position in a huge maternity dress,&quot; she said. &quot;If I hadn't been  pregnant, I wouldn't be in aerospace today.&quot; </p>
        <p>But she stayed and slashed  employment from 70 employees to 16, relocated the company from a 70,000-square-foot  site to a space one-tenth the size, paid back more than $1 million in legal  fees, and took the company back to profitability. &quot;I didn't sleep for a  year, I was so stressed.&quot; </p>
        <p> But at the end of the  process, her then-boss in Ireland,  Hugo Flinn, approached Borgnes with the proposal that they together buy Pacific  Aero Tech, a tiny side business that had almost escaped notice under the wing  of the much-larger Pacific Aero Support. Flinn is now her partner and a  director of Pacific Aero Tech, as well as general manager of finance and  business for Bank of Ireland Group in Dublin. </p>
        <p> In an e-mail, Flinn called  Borgnes' reputation &quot;excellent, built from scratch through integrity and  quality of product and honoring commitments made.&quot; </p>
        <p> At the point she and Flinn  bought it the company had only four people, but Borgnes has steadily built it  up since then. Three of the four are still with her, and they now hold senior  positions.</p>
        <p> &quot;I just happened to  luck out and buy a company that had guys with incredible potential,&quot; she  said. &quot;I just empowered them, and said, `Go for it.' &quot; </p>
        <p> She's also built a  multilayered incentive program, including a bonus program usually worth upward  of $4,000 a year for her workers, a matched 401(k) program, a profit-sharing  plan and a lucrative &quot;hero of the quarter&quot; award.</p>
        <p> &quot;We sink or swim  together,&quot; she said. </p>
        <p> Dave Pickering, one of her  original employees and now a department head, admits it was &quot;a little  scary&quot; when Borgnes had bought the company and was taking over.</p>
        <p> &quot;We didn't know what  was going to happen,&quot; he said. But now he's developed loyalty to his boss,  partly because she returns it. &quot;She bends over backwards if people have  problems,&quot; he said. </p>
        <p> Now 40, with two children,  Borgnes is clearly mindful of her unusual position as a woman executive but not  fixated on it. She's also glad the role of women has evolved from her first  years in business, so she now can be more herself. </p>
        <p> In the beginning, she  remembers, &quot;We wore little gray suits and floppy bow ties, and tried to  act like little men,&quot; she said. Now, &quot;I find the trick is not to try  to be one of the guys. I don't even try.&quot; </p>
        <p> Joann Cassidy, manager of  subcontractor repair for Aviation Sales Distribution Co. in Miami, said she's  been impressed by Borgnes' skill as an executive.</p>
        <p> &quot;The airline industry  is very male-dominated, so for a woman to own a business, and get it to the  level she's gotten it to, is quite commendable. You're really wheeling and  dealing in a men's world,&quot; she said.</p>
