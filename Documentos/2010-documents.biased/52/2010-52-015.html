<p><strong><a name="borgman" id="borgman"></a>Professor  Christine L. Borgman, PhD</strong><br />
  <br />
  Professor &amp; Presidential Chair in Information  Studies, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, UCLA, CA<br />
  Christine  L. Borgman is well known and distinguished teacher and researcher in the LIS  field. Professor Borgman received her BA in Mathematics (Michigan State U), MSc  in Library Science (U of Pittsburgh) and PhD in Communication (Standford U). <br />
  Her  main interests are in scholarly communication, digital libraries, scientific  information, information seeking, information retrieval, bibliometrics,  information policy and infrastructure, and human-computer interaction. Her current research clusters in two areas. One is  empirical research on the creation, use, and management of scientific data and  its implications for science policy. This research is associated with the <a href="http://research.cens.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Center for  Embedded Networked Sensing</a> and with the <a href="http://censei.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">CENSEI Project</a>. The research addresses data  characteristics, data sharing, data policy, and data architecture. The goals  are to apply knowledge of scientific data practices to the design of data  collection and management tools, and to the design and policy of information  services for research and Education. <br />
  Professor Borgman has published widely  on scientific and digital information, information behaviour, bibliometrics and  digital scholarship. <br />
  Her latest book, <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/cborgman/PubsDA.html">Scholarship  in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet</a>, was published by the MIT Press. The  book examines the roles that information technology plays at every stage in the life cycle of a research project and  contrasts these new capabilities with the relatively stable system of scholarly  communication, which remains based on publishing in journals, books, and  conference proceedings. </p>
