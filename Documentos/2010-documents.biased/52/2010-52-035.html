<br>     In response to a Nigerian Muslim trying to blow up a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day, the government will now prohibit international travelers from going to the bathroom in the last hour before the plane lands.<br> <br>     Terrorists who plan to bomb planes during the first seven hours of the eight-hour flight, however, should face no difficulties, provided they wait until after the complimentary beverage service has been concluded.<br> <br>     How do they know Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab didn&#39;t wait until the end of the flight to try to detonate explosives because he heard the stewardess announce that the food service was over and seats would have to be placed in their upright position? <I>I can&#39;t finish my snack? This plane is going down!</I><br> <br>     Also prohibited in the last hour of international flights will be: blankets, pillows, computers and in-flight entertainment. Another triumph in Janet Napolitano&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s stay one step behind the terrorists&quot; policy!<br> <br>     For the past eight years, approximately 2 million Americans a day have been subjected to humiliating searches at airport security checkpoints, forced to remove their shoes and jackets, to open their computers, and to remove all liquids from their carry-on bags, except minuscule amounts in marked 3-ounce containers placed in Ziploc plastic bags -- folding sandwich bags are verboten -- among other indignities.<br> <br>     This, allegedly, was the price we had to pay for safe airplanes. The one security precaution the government refused to consider was to require extra screening for passengers who looked like the last three-dozen terrorists to attack airplanes.<br> <br>     Since Muslims took down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, every attack on a commercial airliner has been committed by foreign-born Muslim men with the same hair color, eye color and skin color. Half of them have been named Mohammed.<br> <br>     An alien from the planet &quot;Not Politically Correct&quot; would have surveyed the situation after 9/11 and said: &quot;You are at war with an enemy without uniforms, without morals, without a country and without a leader -- but the one advantage you have is they all look alike. ... What? ... What did I say?&quot;<br> <br>     The only advantage we have in a war with stateless terrorists was ruled out of order ab initio by political correctness.<br> <br>     And so, despite 5 trillion Americans opening laptops, surrendering lip gloss and drinking breast milk in airports day after day for the past eight years, the government still couldn&#39;t stop a Nigerian Muslim from nearly blowing up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day.<br> <br>     The &quot;warning signs&quot; exhibited by this particular passenger included the following:<br> <br>     His name was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.<br> <br>     He&#39;s Nigerian.<br> <br>     He&#39;s a Muslim.<br> <br>     His name was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.<br> <br>     He boarded a plane in Lagos, Nigeria.<br> <br>     He paid nearly $3,000 in cash for his ticket.<br> <br>     He had no luggage.<br> <br>     His name was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.<br> <br>     Two months ago, his father warned the U.S. that he was a radical Muslim and possibly dangerous.<br> <br>     If our security procedures can&#39;t stop this guy, can&#39;t we just dispense with those procedures altogether? What&#39;s the point exactly?<br> <br>     (To be fair, the father&#39;s warning might have been taken more seriously if he had not simultaneously asked for the U.S. Embassy&#39;s Social Security number and bank routing number in order to convey a $28$ million inheritance that was trapped in a Nigerian bank account.)<br> <br>     The warning from Abdulmutallab&#39;s father put his son on some list, but not the &quot;no fly&quot; list. Apparently, it&#39;s tougher to get on the &quot;no fly&quot; list than it was to get into Studio 54 in the &#39;70s. Currently, the only people on the &quot;no fly&quot; list&quot; are the Blind Sheik and Sean Penn.<br> <br>     The government is like the drunk looking for his keys under a lamppost. Someone stops to help, and asks, &quot;Is this where you lost them?&quot; No, the drunk answers, but the light&#39;s better here.<br> <br>     The government refuses to perform the only possibly effective security check -- search Muslims -- so instead it harasses infinitely compliant Americans. Will that help avert a terrorist attack? No, but the Americans don&#39;t complain.<br> <br>     The only reason Abdulmutallab didn&#39;t succeed in bringing down an airplane with 278 passengers was that: (1) A brave Dutchman leapt from his seat and extinguished the smoldering Nigerian; and (2) the Nigerian apparently didn&#39;t have enough detonating fluid to cause a powerful explosion.<br> <br>     In addition to the no blanket, no computer, no bathroom rule, perhaps the airlines could add this to their preflight announcement about seat belts and emergency exits: &quot;Should a passenger sitting near you attempt to detonate an explosive device, you may be called upon to render emergency assistance. Would you be willing to do so under those circumstances? If not we will assign you another seat ...&quot;<br> <br>     COPYRIGHT 2009 ANN COULTER<br>     DISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK<br>     1130 Walnut, Kansas City, MO 64106<br> <br>
