Keough</b><br/>The Fiscal Year 1993 EPA Enforcement Accomplishments Report is dedicated to Paul G . Keough. Paul was the Acting Regional Administrator of EPA Region I in New England at the time of his sudden death on January 17,1994. Paul served EPA since its inception in 1971, and had held the position of Acting Regional Administrator since January 1993. It was the third time he had served as Acting Regional Administrator. Since 1983, Paul’s offtaal position was as the Deputy Regional Administrator, and in that role he had lead responsibility for Region I’s enforcement programs.<br/>With his background in journalism, Paul also was a national leader in EPA’s efforts to better communicate the successes of our enforcement program. He chaired a national Agency workgroup on communications with the media during the late 1980’s. Among other things, this workgroup recommended a major expansion of the scope and distribution of the annual Enforcement Accomplishments Report. EPA Administrator Carol Browner recognized Paul Keough’s contributions to EPA in her announcement of a national award in his name as follows: “Paul was the toughest of defenders of the environment and EPA, fighting passionately for what he believed to be the correct course of action.” Dedication of this Enforcement Accomplishments Report to Paul Keough recognizes his national leadership in both enforcement and communications. We are grateful for his efforts and we miss him very much.</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Repoporl</b></b></p><p><b>Table of Contents</b><br/>I.</p><p><b><b>FY 1993: Maintaining Enforcement Priorities Environmental Enforcement Activity</b></b></p><p><b>11.</b></p><p><b>111.

FY 1993: Maintaining Enforcement Priorities.</b><br/>During FY 1993, EPA's enforcement program, in partnership with the enforcement programs in each state and the Department of Justice, worked hard to maintain its strong traditional, media-focused enforcement programs and assure that violations of environmental rules and regulations were addressed swiftly and in an appropriate manner. At the same time, EPA accelerated its implementation of innovative multi-media, risk-based enforcement approaches to solving compliance problems and environmental risks, approaches which are described in the Enforcement Four-Year Strategic Plan and the Enforcement in the 1990's Project. Two additional high priority areas for FY 1993 Agency enforcement were environmental justice impacts and our international enforcement program.<br/>1</p><p>The FY 1993 enforcement priorities for each of the Agency's traditional enforcement programs are detailed in Section Three of this Report. In addition, that section highlights significant enforcement cases supporting those priorities. Section Two of this Report and the Appendix provide quantitative statistics on the accomplishments of EPA's media-specific enforcement efforts; these data provide strong evidence that the Agency continues to enforce environmental laws forcefully. During FY 1993, the Agency continued the expansion of the criminal program under the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990, increasing the number of field offices and agents. Criminal sanctions resulting from the expansion in the capacity of our criminal program provide a clear message to those engaged in criminal behavior that those actions will not be tolerated. (For examples, see Section Three criminal cases write-ups.) With increased authority also to assess penalties administratively, the Agency continued to screen cases to ensure use of the appropriate mix of administrative, civil judicial and criminal enforcement authorities to prosecute and resolve violations. Civil enforcement continues to be the primary mechanism for establishing program precedents and resolving complex technical issues. Civil injunctive relief and administrative settlements compel industry to invest in environmental cleanup, pollution controls, and new technology to mitigate environmental damage resulting from noncompliance. Innovat ive Enforceme nt A D D r o d Major elements of the innovative enforcement approach which the Agency continued to implement in FY 1993 are: targeting enforcement at sources and pollutants of particular risk or compliance concern, or at geographic areas of concern; multi-media compliance assessments and multi-media enforcement responses; and developing settlements which include pollution prevention, waste minimization and other innovative solutions to environmental problems.<br/>1-1</p><p><b>(9</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Multi-med ia. Risk-based Enforcement Targeting As part of its multi-media, risk-based strategy, beginning in FY 1991 the Agency has emphasized annual national 'targeted' enforcement initiatives. National enforcement initiatives can focus on specific pollutants, industries, and sensitive geographic zones which present a national risk from the standpoints of human health, the environment, and the maintenance of the integrity of agency regulatory programs. This effort continued during FY 1992 when the Agency filed nine benzene cases, prosecuted twenty-four previously filed lead cases, and filed a total of sixty-four cases against the primary metals, pulp and paper, and industrial organic chemical industries. These three industries were targeted on the bases of toxic releases and historical noncompliance. These cases have resulted in significant settlements in FY 1993, many of which are discussed in detail in Section Three. During FY 1993, the agency commenced two additional two-year long national initiatives. One, a Data Integrity/Data Quality initiative, focussed principally on non-reporters and false reports of data that are required under national and delegated programs. The goal is to send a positive, consistent message to the regulated community on the importance to EPA and the states of obtaining complete and accurate data to determine compliance and to assess environmental progress. Each Agency enforcement office is participating in this effort. The second FY 1993 initiative is a comprehensive program to address multimedia enforcement and compliance issues at federal facilities. At least forty high priority federal facilities across the all EPA regions are being inspected for multimedia compliance. Selection of the facilities was based upon preestablished criteria that include compliance history, EPA regional risk rankings, pollution prevention opportunities, and compatibility with EPA national or regional/state program priorities. States have been encouraged to participate in the inspections. As part of the initiative process, EPA and states, to the extent possible, &quot;cluster&quot; or group individual cases for filing. The purpose of case &quot;clusters&quot; is to gain maximum deterrence through capturing the attention of the media and the regulated community. EPA is analyzing the impact of completed initiatives to assess &quot;what works best and what doesn't work&quot; so that future enforcement activity can be carried out in the most efficient manner. As EPA expanded its use of initiatives and case clusters, state participation in both the formulation and execution of these activities is taking on added significance. The process for multi-media strategic ' planning ensures that states are directly involved in the formulation of national priorities and will have sufficient time to plan for this involvement. National initiatives for FY 1994 and beyond will be identified in conjunction with a broadbased multi-media team, including state representatives.<br/>1-2</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p>One of the major tools for identifying enforcement initiatives is the agency's IDEA (Integrated Data for Enforcement Analysis) computer capability. IDEA, which links the agency's compliance, toxic release inventory (TRI), and geographic (GIS) data systems, is used to screen and target single and multi-media enforcement efforts. EPA has already demonstrated the IDEA capability to several states and has worked to more widely deliver IDEA training to states. Environmental<br/>A central tenet of our enforcement philosophy is that citizens receive full and equal protection under our environmental laws and regulations, regardless of race, nationality, or social standing. Environmental equity concerns are being institutionalized as a core component of our enforcement program and throughout the Agency as a whole in rulemaking. research, and policy.</p><p>The Agency has taken specific steps to ensure that the enforcement program supports the health and welfare of minority populations. For example, the national enforcement initiative to reduce lead exposure was implemented in large part because of the understanding that lead is one of the most pervasive chemicals impacting minority populations, especially children. Our Federal Facilities Enforcement Program is beginning a comprehensive study of environmental equity issues as they relate to pollution generated and emitted at federal facilities. The EPA regional offices are taking specific enforcement actions to protect minority populations. For example, Region 1 is performing a study of Superfund 1 enforcement at minority/low income communities using geographic information system (GIS) mapping, and Region V implemented a geographic enforcement initiative to reduce pollution exposure to Southeast Chicago residents and the Wisconsin Native American Indian Tribes. Similarly, Region VI and Headquarters are coordinating compliance and enforcement actions in a geographic initiative targeted at the Mexican border area (in conjunction with Mexico), and Region IX has implemented an enforcement initiative targeted for drinking water sources at migrant farmworker camps. Innovative Settlements Over the last several years, the Agency has looked for ways to expand the impact of enforcement settlements by securing additional environmental benefits beyond that which can be required through injunctive relief. One of the major tools used by the agency has been the use of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), especially ones which emphasize pollution prevention and waste minimization. Over the last two years, the inclusion of SEPs in settlements have increased substantially and the environmental benefit resulting from them has indeed far exceeded the benefits available through injunctive relief. A review of case summaries in Section Three of this report will demonstrate the frequent use of<br/>1-3</p><p><b>(9)</b></p><p><b>*: *Ylm+</b></p><p><b>, &quot;&quot;,</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>these projects and illustrate their innovative solutions to solving pollution problems.</b></p><p><b>1 4</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p><b>+:“”&lt; . “B</b></p><p><b>11.</b></p><p><b><b>Environmental Enforcement Activity</b></b></p><p><b>A. Federal Judicial and Administrative Enforcement Activity</b><br/>During FY 1993, EPA continued to implement the strategic approaches called for in the Agency‘s Enforcement Four-Year Strategic Plan through through cross-program/multi-media and multi-facility enforcement actions which seek to bring about comprehensive solutions to complex interrelated environmental problems. With this perspective, EPA intends to achieve additional public health and environmental protection results, deterrence, and efficiency which might not be achieved through use of traditional single-media approaches alone. In FY 1993, EPA fully implemented modifications to its activity counting methodologies that track and account for civil referral activity. These adjustments were recommended by an Agency-wide workgroup 2nd are intended to account for the greater magnitude of cross-program/multi-media actions, and to remove any accounting-related disincentives to bringing more complex cases. EPA is also implementing other enforcement indicators that are intended to provide a more complete and balanced picture of the quality and magnitude of its enforcement efforts. In this and other sections of this report, more information is provided on EPA’s use of Administrative Penalty Orders, which are an effective complement to civil judicial enforcement tools, along with information on the value of injunctive relief and Supplemental Environmental Projects, which complement information reported on civil penalty assessments.</p><p><b>B. Federal Civil Judicial Enforcement</b><br/>In FY 1993, EPA referred 338 civil judicial cases to the Department of Justice, down six percent from FY 1992. Program-specific increases were recorded for the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, which when combined, increased 9% from FY 1992. Clean Air Act civil referrals declined by 12 cases, however, use of Clean Air Act Administrative Penalty Order (APO) authorities increased by 154 cases, an increase of 67% over the FY 1992 level. Agencywide, issuance of APOs increased by 180 cases from FY 1992, an increase of 12%. The Office of Enforcement expects that the trend toward greater use of APO authorities will continue, and in the future the civil judicial referral and APO indicators will need to be viewed together in assessments of civil enforcement activity levels.</p><p><b>=WATER</b></p><p><b><b>E TOXICSI PESTICIDES</b></b></p><p><b>RCRA</b></p><p><b>ssl SUPERFUND</b></p><p><b>AIR</b></p><p><b>i</b><br/>2-1</p><p><b>Q3</b></p><p><b>--*-I</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>C. Monitoring Judicial Consent Decrees</b><br/>The high levels of civil judicial enforcement activity over the last several years have resulted in accompanying large increases in the number of consent decrees which the Agency has entered into with violating facilities. EPA places high priority on ensuring that defendants live up to the obligations assure that are spelled out in consent decrees. At the end of FY 1993, the Agency reported that 968 active judicial consent decrees were in place and being actively monitored to ensure compliance, an increase of 153 (up 18%)from FY 1992. Where noncompliance with a decree is found, EPA may initiate proceedings with the court to compel the facility to live up to its agreement and seek penalties for such noncompliance. EPA referred 18 cases to DOJ for enforcement of the consent decree compared to 19 cases in FY 1992.</p><p><b>D. Federal Criminal Judicial Enforcement</b><br/>EPA's criminal program established records in FY 1993 for several categories of activity. New records included referring 140 cases to DOJ (the previous record was 107 in FY 1992), bringing charges against 161 defendants (the previous record was 150 in FY 1992), and the number of months of jail time defendants served with 876 months (the previous record was 744 months in FY 1992). Seventy-seven criminal cases concluded during the year, in which 135 defendants were convicted. In addition, 57 of the defendants convicted were sentenced to incarceration. Incarceration and probation are key parts of the criminal program, including serving a strong deterrent role. Probation is very effective because in the event that an individual commits another crime (not limited to environmental crimes), the provisions of the probation normally call for the automatic imposition of the prison sentence that was suspended in lieu of probation. Since 1982, individuals have received prison sentences for committing environmental crimes totaling 429 years, and 1,261 years of probation have been imposed. EPA's increased emphasis on the criminal enforcement program over the past five years, coupled with passage and implementation of the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990, has significantly raised the profile of criminal enforcement both within EPA and in the regulated community. By the end of FY 1993, EPA had increased the number of criminal agents to 110 compared to 47 in FY 1989. This additional investment in agents has yielded significant increases in most of the key outputs of the</p><p><b><b>ICriminal Enforcement Increases: FY 89 to FY 93b</b><br/>3Wfl</b></p><p><b><b>400 300 200 100 n</b><br/>~</b></p><p><b>FY1989</b></p><p><b>FY1990</b></p><p><b>FY1991</b></p><p><b>FY1992</b></p><p><b>FY1993</b></p><p><b>Cases Initiated</b></p><p><b>Referrals</b></p><p><b>0Defendants</b></p><p><b>2-2</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b><br/>._.,I.. i</b></p><p><b>E. Administrative Enforcement</b><br/>EPA posted its third highest annual total for administrative enforcement activities in FY 1993 with 3,808 actions. The Agency record of 4,136 was set in FY 1989. The totals for FY 1993 demonstrate that although judicial actions (both civil and criminal) have been the most visible indicators of EPA's performance, other indicators need to be considered to fully ascertain EPAs effectiveness in enforcing environmental laws and regulations. In recently enacted or reauthorized statutes, Congress has expanded EPA's authority to use administrative enforcement mechanisms to address violations, compel regulated facilities to achieve compliance, and assess penalties. Many of these administrative authorities provide for injunctive relief and penalties that are comparable to those which can be obtained through civil judicial enforcement. EPA programs issued 1,614 administrative penalty orders (APOS) in FY 1993, an increase of 180 (12%)from FY 1992.</p><p><b>'77</b></p><p><b>'78</b></p><p><b>'79</b></p><p><b>'80 '81</b></p><p><b><b>'82 '83 '84</b></b></p><p><b>'85</b></p><p><b>'86</b></p><p><b><b>'87 '88 '89</b></b></p><p><b>'90 '91</b></p><p><b>'92 '93</b></p><p><b>E EPA Contractor Listing</b><br/>In FY 1993, fifty-seven facilities were added to EPAs List of Violating Facilities (List) under the authorities provided to EPA by Clean Air Act 5 306 and Clean Water Act 5 508, to bar facilities that violate clean air or clean water standards from receiving Federally funded contracts, grants or loans. Federal agencies are prohibited by statutory mandate from entering into contracts, grants or loans (including subcontracts, sub-grants or subloans) to be performed at facilities owned or operated by persons who are convicted of violating air standards under CAA §113(c) or water standards under CWA 5309(c) (and involved in the violations), effective automatically on the date of the conviction. Facilities which are mandatorily listed remain on the List until EPA determines that they have corrected the conditions giving rise to the violations. Fifty-seven facilities were listed in M 1992 based on criminal convictions. Nine facilities were removed from the List in FY 1993. Since FY 1986, 175 facilities have been placed on the mandatory list. One hundred eighteen facilities remained on the List as of the end of FY 1993. Facilities with records of civil violations may also be listed, at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement, upon the recommendation of certain EPA officials, a State Governor, or a member of the public (referred to as discretionary listing).

Cross-ProgradMulti-Media Enforcement and Targeted Enforcement Initiatives</b><br/>While maintaining strong traditional enforcement programs, EPA stressed implementation of the cross-program/multi:media perspective and use of targeted and innovative enforcement approaches. The Agency's primary goal in implementing these approaches it to obtain .additional public health and environmental protection results, greater deterrence, and efficiency which might not be achieved through use of traditional approaches alone. Highlights of Regional performance in these areas include: Cross-progradmulti-media inspections and enforcement actions The Regions implemented the cross-program/multi-media perspective through use of workgroups which targeted crossprogram/multi-media inspections, conducted case screening on single media enforcement cases, and coordinated case management against facilities with cross-program violations. FY 1993 was the second year for which the Agency has collected data on cross-program/multi-media activities, and the data are very encouraging. In FY 1993, the Regions conducted 209 consolidated (simultaneous) crossprogram/multi-media inspections and 71 additional coordinated inspections (inspections conducted in follow-up to concerns raised during an inspection by another program). In all, 858 individual program compliance assessments occurred in these 280 inspections. During FY 1993, the Agency initiated 24 crossprogram/multi-media administrative enforcement actions, referred 12 multi-media judicial cases to DOJ and completed 18 cross-program/multi-mediasettlements which grew out of a single media case. In addition to these inspections the Regions reported conducting 2700 single-median inspections using a multi-media inspection checklist. .</p><p><b>2-6</b></p><p><b>111.</b></p><p>Maior Enforcement Litigation and Kev Leva1 Precedents Protectine Public Health and the Environment through Enforcement</p><p>This chapter provides highlights of major environmental litigation in FY 1993. These cases support EPA and state enforcement priorities and demonstrate i n n o v a t i v e approaches in the enforcement process. FY 1993 was an exciting and challenging year for EPA's and the states' enforcement efforts. EPA continued implementation of the new enforcement approaches, described in the Agency's Enforcement Four-Yenr Stratexi'c Plan and Enforcement in the 1990s Proiect by which federal and state governments could better promote compliance with, and effective deterrence against violations of, environmental laws.</p><p>In FY 1993, the program's general compliance monitoring and enforcement efforts continued to place high priority upon implementation of the 1990 amendments. The program, working w i t h the states, also emphasized the compliance of sources with State Implementation Plans (SIPS), New Source Performance Standards ( N S P S ) , and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and compliance with the dry cleaning rule, permits enforceability review under Title V , and the benzene wastewater rule. The program maintains an active effort to implement the requirements of the Montreal Protocol to protect stratospheric ozone. Enforcement actions were taken against persons who import CFCs without first obtaining the allowances necessary to ensure that overall U.S. consumption of these chemicals does not exceed the limits imposed by the protocols.<br/>The air program continues to focus enforcement activity on criteria pollutants. It also emphasized compliance f o r pollutants specific to certain industries and geographic areas that, pose the greatest health and ecological risk. For example, the program has previously implemented lead and benzene NESHAP initiatives and will continue to target f o r violations involving asbestos and vinyl chloride. A s part of the geographic initiatives f o r the Mexican Border area, the program emphasizes compliance w i t h air quality standards for ozone, PM-IO, and carbon monoxide. The program also emphasizes compliance with volatile organic compound limitations in ozone nonattainment areas. With passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendment, the air program will be developing a host of new rules that are heavily dependent on data accuracy and integrity (e.g., enhanced monitoring. continuous emission monitoring. hazardous air pollutants). A s part of the FY 1993 National Data Quality Initiative, the air program ensured the quality of air emission reports submitted by stationary sources to regional, state, and local air agencies, and compliance with emission monitor certification requirements.</p><p><b>Clean Air Act Enforcement</b><br/>Stationary Sources<br/>The 1990 Clean A i r Act ( C A A ) amendments generally expanded EPA's enforcement authorities and tools, providing f o r a more flexible enforcement program. For example, in Mny 1992, the program undertook a coordinated nntionwide filing of fifty-two C A A administrative penalty cases under the new authorities granted by the act. These cases covered a variety of regulations, including new requirements for continuous emissions monitoring equipment at petroleum refineries, benzene and uranium mining waste piles, and state standards for smoke density and airborne particle emission. The 1990 amendments also expanded contractor listing snnctions, authorized a. new field citations program and tougher criminal enforcement provisions, and provided for citizen suits. In nddition, the CAA necessitnted implementation of the revised Significant Violatorllimely and Appropriate Guidance, which applies to all major sources as defined by the amendments.

(D.Mass.): On October 12, 1993, the U.S. District Court approved a settlement between EPA and Archer Rubber Company of Milford, Massachusetts settling an action initiated by EPA in July 1990 alleging violations of §113 of the CAA and the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan (SIP). EPA's complaint alleged violations at Archer's Milford facility since 1985 involving uncontrolled emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the company's fabric surface coating operations. Under the settlement, Archer is obligated to, among other things: (1) pay a $200,000 penalty; (2) install, test and operate VOC capture and control equipment in compliance with the SIP; (3) keep extensive written records concerning VOC emissions and the use of emission controls; (4) report to EPA on a quarterly basis; and (5) pay significant stipulated penalties for each day of each violation of the consent decree terms. The settlement allows Archer to admit no liability for the alleged violations. Under the settlement, EPA agreed to withdraw a contractor listing action against Archer, under 5306 of the CAA, based on Archer's record of continuing or recurring noncompliance with clean air standards and on prior EPA enforcement actions taken against the company. While agreeing to withdraw the listing action, EPA expressly reserves the right to initiate a second listing action in the event of any future violation by Archer of the CAA, the SIP, or the consent decree.

The decree resolved violations of the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations under the CAA that require a valid PSD permit before construction commences on a new major stationary source. In March 1981, EPA Region 111 issued Coors a PSD permit for the construction of a 10 million barrel-per-year brewery. The permit was reissued and extended on numerous occasions by the State, who required, as a condition of the extension, that Coors complete a new PSD review prior to initiating construction of the brewery. However, Coors initiated construction of certain brewery elements without meeting the terms and conditions of its PSD permit extensions. The consent decree requires Coors to send a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and EPA certifying that it has abandoned plans to construct the brewery as a major stationary source, as defined under PSD regulations, for a five-year period. As a result, Coors now proposes to use natural gas instead of coal as its boiler fuel, and will relinquish all rights it now has to available Shenandoah Park class I sulfur dioxide increments, held solely by Cmrs for over 12 years.

Since the State of Idaho had limited resources to inspect this large universe of major stationary sources, EPA agreed to conduct field inspections of 25 wood products facilities in the Idaho panhandle. As a result of violations documented during these inspections, Region X issued nine administrative penalty actions and made two referrals to the DOJ (one involves a Louisiana-Pacific facility, included in the national settlement discussed below). I addition to substantial penalties, the n settlements included both extensive injunctive relief provisions and supplemental environmenhl projects requiring reduced emissions through improved operations, better maintenance, installation of continuous emission monitors, and source testing.

U.S. Oil and US. v.Texaco (W.D. Wash): In FY 1993, EPA settled the first two judicial penalties assessed under the new Oil Pollution Act of 1990. One was against U.S. Oil &amp; Refining Co., and arose out of a January 1991 spill of more than 600,000 gallons (14,000 barrels) of oil from a ruptured pipeline into a drainage ditch that ordinarily drains to Commencement Bay in Tacoma, Washington.<br/>The other was against Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc., and involved a spill of approximately 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of oil from a burst pipeline booster pump. A significant amount of the oil entered Fidalgo Bay near Anacortes, Washington, causing an oil slick that killed more than 140 birds. Under the settlements, U.S. Oil had civil penalties in the amount of $425,000 while Texaco had penalties in the amount of $480,000. US. Oil andTexaco were both made to acquire and install state-of-the-art spill detection and prevention equipment at an estimated cost of $800,000 each. U.S. Oil is to reimburse federal spill response costs of $60,000 and Texaco must reimburse $125,000. The estimated complete spill cleanup cost for U.S.Oil is $4,000,000 and $8,000,000 for Texaco. These cases form a very significant landmark in the implementation of OPA. They represent the nation's first two judicial penalties assessed under OPA, and established the maximum civil penalty for an oil spill as $1,000 per barrel spilled rather than $5,000 per spill. Achieving such significant penalty amounts in the first two cases under the new act, when one spill (U.S. Oil) caused nearly no environmental impact and the other (Texaco) involved nearly no fault on the defendant's part, establishes the new Act as an extremely powerful enforcement tool and a deterrent to future spills, as Congress clearly intended.</p><p>The N e w York and New Jersey municipalities which were dumping sewage sludge at the 106-mile site off the coast of New Jersey for many years have now eased dumping sewage sludge into the ocean, as required by the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 (ODBA).

The decree calls for a civil penalty of $2.5 million. Grumman will initially pay $1.5 million in cash. If Grumman completes several innovative pollution prevention projects, then the settlement amount will be reduced by $1 million. Grumman strips, paints,and refurbishes aircraft at its St. Augustine, Florida facility. The U.S. brought this action against Grumman on February 22, 1991, as part of the RCRA Land Disposal Restrictions Initiative. The pollution prevention provisions will substantially reduce or eliminate several highly toxic waste streams, including a paint stripper, methylene chloride and ozone-depleting chemicals (e.g. CFCs). Substituting a nonhazardous paint stripper for methylene chloride may set a precedent for paint strippers across the country as most of them use hazardous solvents in their operations. EPA estimates that up to 240,000 pounds of hazardous emissions per year will be eliminated and toxic sludge will be reduced if Grumman is in compliance with RCRA.

On September 2,1993, the court reversed an earlier decision and found the Taracorp site to be a landfill. A hearing on September 20, 1993 determined civil penalties. Teradvne In&amp;: On July 19,1993, Teradyne Inc. and EPA entered into a settlement agreement for a 3-29</p><p>1991 RCRA enforcement action against the company. This matter was settled for a total penalty of $120,000. This includes a cash payment of $50,000 plus credit towards the performance of two supplemental environmental projects. Teradyne will expend approximately $800,000 for the purchase and installation of solvent replacement units, one at the Nashua facility (approximate cost of $350,000), and one at the Boston facility (approximate cost of $450,000). EPA has granted Teradyne a credit of $70,000 for the proposed projects. Teradyne has certified that it is presently in compliance with RCRA requirements. Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Comuany. (Kenai, Alaskal: In an administrative enforcement action involving a series of complex RCRA regulatory issues, EPA negotiated a settlement with T a r o Alaska Petroleum Company in which the company agreed to pay a $550,000 penalty.

The decree provides that United Technologies Corporation (UTC) will pay a total penalty of $5,301,910, of which $4,251,910 will go to the U.S. and $1,050,000 will go to the State of Connecticut. The decree also incorporated an auditing agreement which requires UTC to implement an extensive multimedia environmental audit at all UTC facilities located in EPA Region I.<br/>This case was first referred to the EPA following an inspection of UTC facilities. The inspections detected a wide range of RCRA violations at eight UTC facilities, including its Pratt &amp; Whitney, Sikorsky, and Hamilton Standard operations.

According to the agreement, WSU would start work on developing plans for a waste exchange on campus that would allow researchers, instructors and students in one university department to be able to reuse materials that had already been used in other departments. Officials at WSU estimated the campus waste exchange would cost more than $87,500. The agreement resulted from an EPA enforcement action involving violations of hazardous waste regulations discovered by inspectors from EPA and the Washington State Department of Ecology. EPA agreed to a penalty of only $22,500 because the university will be implementing the waste exchange and reduction program. Weyerhaeuse r Co.. Loneview, Washineton: In a settlement reached between Weyerhaeuser and EPA in February 1993, it was agreed that unless Weyerhaeuser succeeded in reducing the hazardous waste generated by certain equipment at its Paper Company plant in Longview, Washington by 45 percent, the company would pay a penalty of $38,948 to settle a EPA complaint alleging hazardous waste violations. The arrangement in the settlement would allow Weyerhaeuser to pay only $20,000 if Weyerhaeuser completes the waste reduction program and achieves the reduction. The waste reduction project involves Weyerhaeuser's replacement of 13 devices that have relied on solvents to wash parts at the plant. In 1991, the use of the solvents produced more than 53,000 pounds of hazardous wastes. The waste reduction project was proposed by Weyerhaeuser during negotiations to settle an administrative complaint EPA issued to the company in the summer of 1992. EPA had alleged that Weyerhaeuser failed to follow a number of regulations for the proper management of hazardous waste. Suspending part of' the Weyerhaeuser penalty in exchange for the waste reduction project was EPAs first use in the Pacific Northwest of such an arrangement in a n administrative case involving hazardous wastes.</p><p>pursuant to §3008(a) of RCRA in support of the Agency Data Integrity Initiative.

Considerable concern has been voiced by residents in New York City and elsewhere about the impact of improper disposal of leadcontaining paint chip wastes. Reeion I1 Waste 0il Enforcement Cases. In FY 1993, Region I1 settled two waste oil enforcement cases. These cases had been filed as part of the Region's waste oil enforcement initiative, carried out during the past several years. On January 4, 1993 the U.S. District Court (DNJ) entered a consent decree in U.S. v. B &amp; L Corwration. The decree requires the company to pay a civil penalty of $25,000 and implement a workplan intended to insure compliance with the waste oil regulations. On January 8,1993 the District Court entered the consent decree for US. v. L &amp; L Oil Service. Inc. This decree imposes a civil penalty of $55,000, and requires L &amp; L to comply with a detailed workplan insuring its compliance with the waste oil regulations.

Circle K operates convenience stores and gasoline stations nationwide. The settlement agreement resolved Circle K's RCRA liabilities with respect to potential petroleum contamination from the underground storage tanks at approximately 1,100 stores that Circle K no longer operates. The settlement amount will be paid in six installments into a State trust fund and used to remediate any contamination from petroleum leaks at these sites. This case represents the growing cooperation between EPA and the states in enforcing the underground storage tank provisions of RCRA. I n the Matter of Frank Mustafa : On September 1, 1993, EPA Chief Administrative Law Judge Frazier, issued an Accelerated Decision and Order in an enforcement action under Subtitle I of RCRA governing regulation of underground storage tanks (USTs). The decision was the first in the nation to conshue EPAs Penalty Guidance for Violations of UST Regulations. Judge Frazier found the respondent liable for failure to notify the designated state agency as to the existence of USTs owned by respondent, and for failure to provide a method of release detection, and assessed a civil penalty of $74,105. Frank Mustafa, owns and operates underground storage tanks at two (once three) service stations in the US. Virgin Islands. The complaint charged Mustafa with two counts, failure to notify and failure to provide a method of release detection for six underground storage tanks. The parties stipulated as to respondent's liability, and submitted the issue of the amount of the civil penalty to the Judge for resolution. 3-31</p><p><b>m.v.

The complaint was filed as part of the National RCRA Illegal Operators Initiative. The defendant is located in Somerset, Kentucky. The complaint requests injunctive relief and civil penalties for 148 UST violations and for violations in conjunction with the of a hazardous waste operation treatment/storage/disposal facility and for corrective action. The majority of these violations are for failure to comply with leak detection regulations. This case, the first civil referral in the nation to enforce the UST leak detection regulations, arose as a result of a multimedia inspection performed by Region IV RCRA and UST Programs, as well as the Kentucky OSHA program. Somerset is the second largest UST owner in Kentucky.<br/>W S X Gam W o b On July 26,1993, EPA and USX entered into a consent agreement and final order (CAFO) resolving EPAs claims relating to violations of RCRA and the underground storage tank (UST) regulations at USXs Gary Works facility.

In order to conduct the estimated $13 million remedial action at this NPL mine-waste site, EPA needed access to property owned by approximately 150 different individuals. Most of the property owners voluntarily agreed to provide access to EPA. However, six individuals denied EPA access to the site, and administrative orders were issued requiring them to provide EPA with all access necessary to perform the remedial action. Each owner complied with the access order, and remedial action construction activities were able to begin as soon as the design was completed.

The administrative order, which directed the named parties to provide EPAand its contractors with access to their property for response work, was issued in 1989. When defendants refused to comply, EPA promptly obtained a court order compelling compliance. Thereafter, the U.S. sought a determination that the defendants' had unreasonably failed to comply with the order, which is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the assessment of penalties.

The settlement arises out of the filing by EPA of a cost recovery action against Chemical Commodities, Inc., a defunct corporation in which Gershon was the sole shareholder, and Gershon personally. Gershon responded by filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Subsequent to the filing of Gershon's bankruptcy, EPA filed a proof of claim for response costs incurred and to be incurred by it for clean-up activities undertaken and to be undertaken by EPA at the sites.

EPA had issued a n emergency order under the SDWA in 1989 to address groundwater contamination in the area. After receiving additional citizens' complaints regarding high incidence of disease in the neighborhood in the summer of 1992, EPA held a meeting with local, state and other federal agencies, including a task force organized by the Governor of Georgia, and determined that there were legitimate concerns for the health of this community. EPA developed a work plan for the area during the fall of 1992, and began sampling surface soils, surface water, groundwater and sediments in February 1993. EPA tested residential areas as well as 18 industrial sites within the neighborhood. Over 1,000 samples were taken and then analyzed for up to 176 constituents, including dioxin analysis for a percentage of samples. This effort represents the largest scale site assessment in Region IV. This area is a lower income and predominantly African-American neighborhood, and EPA is very conscious of the environmental equity issues inherent in the situation. EPA from the beginning included in its consultations the Governor's Task Force, which includes a number of citizens from the area, and met with the community prior to beginning the sampling effort and attended a May 15, 1993, McKinney-organized community meeting to address citizen concerns. EPA released the technical report of the data collected at a September 10, 1993 meeting of interested governmental organizations, and has asked ATSDR to analyze the data for health implications. EPA held a public meeting in Augusta on September 16,1993 to present the data to citizens. The data were such that the Region did not believe an imminent and substantial endangerment exists, and the Region is awaiting a reassessment by ATSDR of the possible connection between contaminants found and health impacts 3-37</p><p>Y.S. v AVX Co1. 0d 0.

Simultaneously, the court also entered a First Amendment to Consent D c e pertaining to ere the consent decree for the first operable unit. The expected cost of the remedy is $5.8 million.<br/>The site is an old granite quarry, located in an industriaVsuburban area of New Bedford. The site is owned by the City of New Bedford. From about 1935 through the 1970's, the City owned and operated the Ledge as a dump for local industrial wastes and solid wastes. The site was listed on the National Priorities List in 1984. The settlement requires the PRPs to excavate an ecologically sensitive marsh which lies in the midst of a golf course. Excavated sediments are then to be disposed of beneath a cap to be constructed at the first operable unit. Work at the first operable unit is subject to a previous consent decree. The remedy to be performed by the PRPs is precedent-setting in that it is driven by ecological risks, rather than human health risks. Under the decree, fifteen entities, including the City of New Bedford, agree to perform the remedy. However, the responsibilities of the parties vary greatly. AVX Corporation agrees to perform all the work (consisting of the remedial action plus operations and maintenance). The City of New Bedford agrees to perform specific portions of the remedial action (not including O+M) and secure access and institutional controls. The consent decree sets u p triggers and mechanisms whereby AVX must undertake unperformed obligations of the City.

These substances have been detected in the groundwater at the site in concentrations exceeding the allowable MCLs under state and federal law. Subsequent to EPAs publication of a proposed plan for remediation, EPA obtained sampling data indicating unexplained increases in groundwater contaminant concentrations. B &amp; B ascribed these increases to its operation of the county-ordered groundwater treatment system for 30 days prior to EPAs sampling. Accordingly, EPA issued the order to B &amp; B requiring it to cease groundwater extraction and treatment until further notice, remove the groundwater pump, and allow EPA to install a lockable well cap. The facility agreed to comply, and the sampling is proceeding on schedule. This will allow EPA to select an appropriate remedy for the site.</p><p>March 17,1993, the court entered a consent decree concerning the Metamora Landfill site in Lapeer County, Michigan. The decree requires that 34 PRPs perform remedial action at the site, estimated to cost $50,000,000. This remedial action work consists of incinerating barrels at the site, capping the landfill, constructing and operating a groundwater pump and treat system, and remediating site soils. The decree. also requires that the settling PRPs reimburse EPA for its oversight costs. The Metamora Landfill site is a 160 acre site that operated from the mid-1950’s until 1980. Both municipal and industrial waste was disposed of at the site. EPA has incurred response costs at the site in excess of $30 million dollars. Because the decree does not recover EPAs response costs incurred prior to the entry of the decree, EPA’s final action at the site is recovery of these costs. Suoerfund Site, (Weed Ca1.L: On September 30, 1993 EPA entered into an administrative consent order for 92.5% of EPA’s past costs ($2,324,381.10) incurred at the J.H.

B IR c i1 F- o k- 1 Superfund Site: The BFI-Rockingham Landfill Superfund site represents EPAs first comprehensive application of the Superfund Accelerated' Cleanup Model (SACM) at an NPL site in Region 1. The use of SACM expedited response activities at the site by one to two years. Moreover, SACM saved EPA and the PRPs substantial transaction costs in connection with the performance of an RI/FS and the negotiation of an administrative order for a non-time critical removal action. The BFI-Rockingham site is a municipal landfill located in Rockingham, Vermont. The settling parties in this case include Disposal Specialists, Inc., the owner and operator of the site, and Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc., the transporter of waste to the landfill. Both companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Browning-Fems Industries, Inc. The BFI entities entered an administrative order to perform the RI/FS in August 1992. During the RI/FS, the Region recognized the opportunity to apply EPA's new presumptive remedy for municipal landfills.

The Region has continued this expedited approach during the design phase of the work. The environment will benefit from prompt implementation of the source control measures, which will reduce further migration of contaminants to the environment, most notably ground water.

According to the administrative order on consent, the settling PRPs are required to pay their volumetric share of the U.S.' past response costs and estimated future response costs for remediating the H. Brown Superfund site. in addition, these parties will pay a settlement premium of 1.0 (Le. a 2.0 multiplier) for the estimated future response costs for the remediation. Approximately $650,000 was recovered by EPA in this settlement, which represents 50% of past response costs to date. The H. Brown site, located in Walker, Michigan, had been placed on the NPL on March 29,1985. It is contaminated with lead, antimony, cadmium, copper, chromium, and nickel as a result of the H. Brown Company having cracked, shredded, and scattered battery casings over the entire site during its lead reclamation activities. On September 30, 1992, EPA issued a Record of Decision which called for the following remedy components: solidifying, in place, the contaminated surface and subsurface soil and sediments in a cement-like form; constructing a multi-layer cap over the solidified soil; surrounding the solidified soil with a containment wall; collecting, treating, and discharging groundwater and surface water from the shallow aquifer; and demolishing buildings which are contaminated.</p><p>In the Matter of C ' : 1111993, EPA issued two administrative orders for performance of remedial action and groundwater investigative work at the Caldwell Trucking site in Fairfield, New Jersey.

Ciba-Geigy also agrees to pay all unreimbursed response costs, approximately $10 million, incurred by the United States for operable unit one and operable unit two (source areas), resulting in a total settlement value of approximately $70 million. The site is on the NPL. Groundwater at the site is contaminated with organic and inorganic compounds. On April 24, 1989, EPA selected a river discharge remedy in a Record of Decision for operable unit one. The ROD also called for sealing contaminated residential irrigation wells, monitoring groundwater and the Toms River, evaluating lower portions of the aquifer, performing studies on contaminated groundwater to determine appropriate cleanup technologies, and further studying of source areas. On September 30, 1993, the Region also signed an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for the site.

The Tenth Circuit held that, at least with regard to a state authorized to enforce its hazardous waste program in lieu of RCRA, the state has the independent right to enforce state law, administratively or judicially, at CERCLA sites within the state's jurisdiction. More specifically, the court held that: [11 5113(W does not bar a federal court from hearing a state suit to enforce a state administrative order that addresses a CERCLA site because enforcement of provisions of a state-delegated program cannot per se be a challenge to CERCLA response action.

Respondents included Carrier Corporation, Exxon Company, U.S.A., Borg Warner and Teledyne. The AOC required the respondents to perform the removal action and pay all past and future costs, including oversight. The removal action required under the order includes arranging for a permanent alternative potable water supply to local residents whose wells are contaminated by releases from the site, disposing of waste materials stored in on-site drums and tanks, and disposing of contaminated soil and debris. The Enterprise Recovery Systems, Inc. facility operated from approximately 1979 to 1991 as a fuels blending and solvent recycling facility. The facility ceased operations in October 1991 when its insurer canceled insurance coverage after discovering significant soil and groundwater contamination. Hazardous substances included benzene, xylene, toluene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, naphthalene, acetone, 1,l.ltrichloroethane, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, oils, methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, and chlorinated waste water .</p><p>at the site.

Subsequent to entry of the decree, EPA made it clear to PRIDCO that a cost recovery action would likely be filed against it if the $150,000 in remaining past costs was not paid by September 1993. PRIDCO thereafter entered into negotiations with the other PRPs.

The court found that, although Fleet was a secured lender to SPW, and the Lender Liability Rule did apply, the actions of Fleet's agents voided the statutory exemption for secured creditors. Fleet hired Baldwin Industrial Liquidators (Baldwin) to auction off SPWs equipment and inventory. After the auction, Fleet allowed Nix Rigging Company to salvage the remaining equipment and machinery. It was the actions of Baldwin and Nix that voided the protection of the Lender Liability Rule and of the statutory exemption. the W r of Chemical: On September 30,1993, EPA issued an administrative order on consent to some 275 PRPs requiring them to conduct a removal action at the Frontier Chemical Superfund site, located in Niagara Falls, N.Y. The response action is to include the removal of over 4,000 drums of waste from the site, as well as 6,700 pounds of laboratory chemicals. The work is estimated to cost about $4.7 million.

The site currently is not listed on the NPL. The &quot;participate and cooperate&quot; orders represent an innovative approach to CERCLA enforcement and PRP-lead removals. The orders consist of an administrative order on consent with a group of 11 cooperating PRPs, a n d a unilateral administrative order (UAO) issued to three PRPs who chose not to cooperate with EPA and the PRP Steering Committee. The orders were the first in the nation to use the &quot;participate and cooperate&quot; language developed in conjunction with DOJ. The UAO requires the respondents to work with the cooperating PRPs and either perform or pay for part of the work at the site. Use of the &quot;participate and cooperate&quot; UAO improved the sense of fairness in the Superfund process, and the progress of AOC negotiations with the cooperating PRPs, by requiring response action of the recalcitrant PRPs. The Fuels and Chemicals, Inc., facility operated from 1981 to 1992 as a fuels blending and treating facility and was abandoned in September, 1992. The site includes 31 tanks with a total capacity of 840,000 gallons and approximately 1,200 drums. The approximately 800,000 gallons of hazardous substances stored on-site in unstable and leaking tanks and drums included: lead, chromium, mercury; perchloroethene, trichloroethane, methylene chloride, and l,l,l-trichloroethane. The cooperating PRPs continue the removal activities at the site as required in the AOC.

Pursuant to the unilateral administrative order, the site owner is currently disposing of the remaining drummed wastes, excavating contaminated soil, and decontaminating the buildings and storage bays. The settling parties under the administrative cost recovery agreement are generators and transporters of hazardous substances sent to the site. The agreement provides that the settlors will pay EPA $1.1 million, the majority of EPA's costs. In an effort to facilitate settlement, the Region developed a volumetric ranking list which the PRP group used to develop its internal allocation scheme. The majority of the settlors are commercial entities. A number of federal, state and local entities also participated in the settlement. (N.D. On July 8, 1993, the court entered judgment for costs and treble damages exceeding $10 million against four defendants in the CERC.LA cost recovery cases involving the I. Jones Rkycling, Clinton Street site in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The judgment order: (1) holds Aqua-Tech, Inc; I. Jones Partnership; Frederick J. Cook, Jr.; and Thomas J. Hanchar jointly and severally liable for $784,400.77 in anum response costs and prejudgment interest on those costs; and (2) holds each of the latter three defendants liable for treble damages of $9,663,884.94 for their failure to comply with three unilateral orders issued for removal actions at the site. The I. Jones Recycling, Clinton Street site collected, stored and treated a wide variety of hazardous substances from 1980 through September, 1986. The facility was closed after a chemical fire emitted potentially toxic fumes and required evacuation of adjacent areas, leaving a vast number of containers holding hazardous substances, and widespread contamination within the buildings and soil. EPA filed its cost recovery complaint on March 25, 1991, against all</p><p>owner/operators of the site and against the one viable generator (Aqua-Tech) that had not entered into administrative cost recovery settlements for the site. , . EPA issued unilateral orders on October 14; 1986 and September 3, 1987, requiring the owner/ operators to perform extensive removal actions. The owner/operators did not comply and EPA performed removal actions costing over 52.3 million. By the time EPA was ready to initiate the final phase of site cleanup, the Agency had identified a group of over 150 generators who had sent waste to the site. On July 27,1988, EPA issued a unilateral order to all generators and owner/operators. A group of generators complied with that order incurring costs in excess of 53 million. In the Matter of Kin-Buc Landfill1 On Noyember 11, 1992, EPA'issued a unilateral administrative order in connection with the Kin-Buc Landfill site in New Jersey. The order requires that eleven respondents, responsible parties at the site, perform the RD/RA for the second operable unit (OU2) component of the remedy which was selected in the ROD issued by Region I1 in September, 1992. The work required under OU2 includes excavation of PCB contaminated soils and sediment from an area known as the Edmonds Marsh located next to one of the fills at the site. The excavated material is to be placed onto the landfill before it is capped. OU2 also requires that mitigation measures be carried out in wetlands at the marsh area from which the PCB contaminated material is to be excavated. The estimated cost for the OU2 work is $4.1 million. The respondents were all owners,and/or operators of the landfill. Lindane Dumu Site, (Harrison Township, Pa): On June 28, 1993, in a consent decree entered by the court (E.D.

The order, which was issued after no PRPs were willing to enter into a consent decree with EPA after a 120-day negotiation period, requires the PRPs to implement the remedial action/remedial design (RD/RA) for the site. The remedial action selected by EPA provides for excavation and incineration of landfill wastes and associated soil, excavation and bioremediation (an innovative technology that will be tested during remedial design) of contaminated subsurface soil, and trenching to collect contaminated groundwater for off-site treatment. The remedy is estimated to cost $12.98 million. The site is a landfill which was operated under a state permit between 1974 and 1980. Wastes at the site include wastes from the production of dicamba and benzonitrille by Velsicol Chemical Corporation, and wastes from the latex and carpet industry. Hazardous substances to be addressed at the site include benzonitrille, dicamba, phthalates, dichlorobenzene, and styrene. Matter of US.v. w o n - O u i r k GrFAR-MAR-CO Subsi&amp;, (D.Neb.): On April 19, 1993, the court entered a CERCLA §107(a) cost recovery consent decree for costs incurred in connection with the FAR-MAR-CO subsite o f the Hastings Groundwater Contamination site. The decree required the defendant to pay $2,150,000 for investigative costs incurred by the U.S. through December 31, 1990, and entered' declaratory judgment for all future costs. The defendant has already paid the past costs as required by the consent decree. The consent decree settled an action that the U.S. had commenced on December 31, 1988. The U.S. had won a summary judgment motion on liability and was set to go to trial on the amount of costs owed to the government. Because the costs were incurred in connection with a subsite of the Hastings Groundwater megasite, numerous cost allocations were performed to arrive at a figure representing the FAR-MAR-CO subsite costs. Motor ala, Inc., (D. Ariz.): On August 11, 1993, the court entered the second and final remedial design/remedial action (RD/RA) consent decree for the North Indian Bend Wash (NIBW) Superfund site. Together with the first 3-47</p><p>settlement, this consent decree provides for private sector cleanup of the entire NIBW site, including the restoration of the area-wide aquifer and provides for the recovery of 95%o EPAs past f costs and all future costs. The Indian Bend Wash Superfund site (IBW) encompasses approximately 13 square miles in Scottsdale and Tempe, Arizona and consists of two study areas - NIBW and South Indian Bend Wash. The NIBW site encompasses ten square miles and includes land developed for residential, commercial, and industrial uses. The site was placed on the NPL in 1982 due to the presence of V o C s in the groundwater. The decree requires the defendants to conduct the RD/RA for the vadose zone and shallow groundwater as specified in the NIBW Record of Decision (ROD) dated September 12, 1991. The estimated value of this work, including EPA oversight costs, is $11 million to $14 million. These remedial actions build upon the remedy and corresponding first consent decree for deep and middle-depth groundwater selected in the 1988 Scottsdale Groundwater Operable Unit ROD. The decree also requires the payment of EPA's past response costs of $5,066,048.44, as well as future oversight costs which are estimated at $2.5 million.</p><p>On December 9, 1992, EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to 46 potentially responsible parties at the Muskego Sanitary Landfill Superfund site in Muskego, Wisconsin.

The settlements total $152,180, of which $105,746 will be applied to EPAs outstanding past costs. This settlement had been offered to 39 recalcitrant de minimis generators. In addition, five generators accepted an earlier de minimis offer made to 25 generators. EPA anticipates sending out two more de minimis offers to an additional 60 generators. De minimis generators were defined in this case as those PRPs generating less than 0.1% of the total documented waste disposed of at the site. The site is contaminated with lead, acid and battery casings. An emergency cleanup was done at the site by the Florida Department of Environmental Resources, in response to citizen concerns about the high level of acid and lead in nearby Steele City Bay. EPA conducted a removal, RI/FS and RD in 1989-1991. The site was listed on the NPL in August 1982.

Shell, (C.D. Call: On September 28,1993, the district court granted the Governments' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Liability against four major oil companies in the McColl Superfund site cost recovery action. The McColl Site is located in Fullerton, California, and has been on the NPL since 1983. The 22-acre site contains over 100,000 cubic yards of highly acidic refinery sludge dumped in the early 1940s. The sludge, which contains a variety of hazardous substances including benzene, toluene, and arsenic, periodically seeps to the surface, emitting high levels of sulfur dioxide and posing a threat of dermal contact.</p><p>The Superfund site is located in Lowell, Mass. The Silresim Chemical Corporation operated a chemical waste reclamation facility on the site. The original facility consisted of approximately 4.5 acres, however the extent of contamination includes approximately 16 acres and groundwater contamination. The major problem at the site is contamination by dense, non-aqueous phase liquids in the groundwater. (823 E Supp. 873 (D. Colo. June 8, 1993)): The court held that the defenses provided by CERCLA §107(b) are exclusive, and struck all of the equitable defenses asserted by defendant Pitkin County. Additionally, the court held that defenses which alleged that the governments' response costs were not &quot;cost effective or prudent&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot; were not valid affirmative defenses because the only issue as to recoverability of response costs is consistency with the National Contingency Plan. The court also held that the defendant could not challenge the listing of Smuggler Mountain Superfund site on the NPL as an affirmative defense in this action. Y.S. v. Texaco Ins., (C.D. Calk On August 22,1993, the court entered a consent decree for performance of the remedial design and remedial action at the Pacific Coast Pipeline Superfund site in Fillmore, California. Under the consent decree, Texaco, Inc. and its subsidiary Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc., the sole PRPs, will construct and operate a soil vapor extraction system and a groundwater extraction and treatment system as required by the ROD. The primary contaminant of concern is benzene, which is present in the soil and groundwater at the site. The remedial action is expected to cost $4,000,000. Under the decree, the defendants have agreed to reimburse California for past response costs and the U.S.for future response costs. Texaco, Inc. paid EPAs past costs pursuant to an administrative order on consent for the RI/FS. EPA has the lead for the site and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control is the support agency. The Pacific Coast Pipeline Superfund site was listed on the NPL on October 4, 1989. Texaco, Inc. is currently conducting the remedial design of the remedy in accordance with the consent decree.</p><p>The court ruled as a matter of law that Shell, Union Oil, ARCO, and Texaco are liable for past and future cleanup costs as arrangers for disposal under CERCLA §107(b)(3). The court also ruled that McAuley LCX Corporation, a small privately-held company, is liable as the owner of the site property, rejecting an innocent landowner defense. The U.S. and the State of California, as co-plaintiffs, are seeking over 525 million in past costs. EPA recently selected a remedy valued at $80 million. The four oil companies are performing remedial design activities pursuant to unilateral administrative orders. In granting summary judgment on liability, the court rejected the oil companies' &quot;act of war&quot; defense. This is the first reported decision interpreting the defense, which the court held should be narrowly construed. The oil companies claimed that disposal occurred as part of a government-directed war effort. The court also granted the Governments' motion to bifurcate the case and permit the cost phase to proceed immediately. Plaintiffs have now filed a summary judgment motion for these past costs. The court further stayed the companies' counterclaim against the U.S.,ruling that the contribution action should not interfere with the replenishment of the Superfund. (D. Ma.): On April 27, 1993, the court lodged the consent decree for the Silresim Superfund site. The consent decree consisted of a global settlement with 223 parties, 179 of those parties were de minimis settlors. The parties paid approximately $41 million for a cash-out settlement. The decree also included a re-opener if the remedy costs more than $54.8 million. 3-51</p><p><b>..</b></p><p>US. v. Un ion ScraD Iron &amp; Metal. et al. (D.

The Union Scrap facility was the site of a battery breaking business. During its operation, the company purchased spent lead acid batteries from numerous customers and reclaimed the lead plates by cracking open the plastic battery cases and extracting the plates. This process highly contaminated the soil at the site and seriously threatened human health and the environment. In 1986 and 1988, EPA undertook several remedial activities to remove the lead-tainted soil and debris. Then, in 1989, the Agency initiated CERCLA 5107 proceedings against various defendants in order to recover the approximately $2.1 million expended during the remediation. Allocation issues, however, were extremely difficult since Union Scrap had declared bankruptcy in 1985, and few site records were available from which to construct a waste-in list. A mediator was subsequently employed to help resolve these matters after the conclusion of discovery and while the case was on the court's trial call.</p><p>Superfund site in Washington State, a consent decree enterd on October 16, 1986 required the PRPs to clean up a creek located on site. The site falls within the boundaries of the' City of Kent,which demanded that the PRPs obtain a city permit for the creekcleanup. EPA ana the PRPs responded that, under federal law, no permit was required for this work. The city then issued a stop work order to the PRPs, and the PRPs ceased creek cleanup activity. Inresponse, EPA obtained a declaratory judgment from the federal district court stating that no permit was required to perform the cleanup work The city then lifted its stop work order, and cleanup proceeded. ouse S u ~ e r f u n d (Sunnyvale Ca.): In , September 1993, EPA issued a unilateral administrative order (UAO) for RD/RA to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for design of the groundwater treatment system for the Westinghouse Superfund site. The UAO terminated an administrative order on consent (AOC) for remedial design negotiated in 1992, except for provisions related to payment of .EPA response costs. Westinghouse, the sole PRP identified for the site, submitted a timely Notice of Intent to Comply in November 1993. Issuance of the UAO is anticipated to allow remediation of soil c0,ntamination to proceed prior to the final approval of the design for groundwater remediation. Termination &amp;the AOC will allow some remedial action to begin prior to the completion of all remedial design tasks without the complications of overlapping and potentially conflicting orders. The Westinghouse Site was formerly used to manufacture electrical transformers and is currently used to manufacture steam generators, marine propulsion systems, and missile launching systems for the Department of Defense. Releases of PCBs, volatile organic compounds and fuel compounds have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. The October 1991 Record of the Decision for the site requires remediation of PCBs in the soil, containment of PCB contamination in groundwater in the source area where den&amp; nonaqueous phase liquids are present, and cleanup of all other groundwater contaminants throughout the site. over L a b w o r i e s S Due (M.D.Pa.): On November 4, 1993, the consent 3-52</p><p><b>E .. -</b></p><p>Case &amp; Sons Cutlerv Co, ; a November 30, 1992, the U.S. District Court (W.D.N.Y.) entered a consent decree in this action against W.R.

That order, issued to six PRPs including Case, required respondents to carry out a remedial action at the site. The remaining five respondents complied, but Case declined to participate. In 1988, the government filed a cost recovery action against all six PRPs to recoup its past expenditures, and also included a count against Case for civil penalties for its noncompliance with the order.

The Elm Haven complex was built in the 1950s and demolished in 1990. The settlement requires the Housing Authority, in lieu of paying a penalty, to spend at least $112,OOO on an environmental compliance program designed to protect public housing residents from future environmental risks through better identification and reporting of potentially hazardous conditions involving pollutants such as PCBs, asbestos, pesticides, and rodenticides. Specifically, the settlement requires the Housing Authority to hire an environmental consultant to train Housing Authority personnel at all levels in recognizing and reporting environmental problems, as well as to perform an environmental audit of all 32 Housing Authority properties. This sort of settlement, known as a supplemental environmental project, permits those targeted for EPA enforcement to offset penalty payments with environmentally beneficial expenditures not required by law. This settlement evidences EPA's commitment to principles of environmental justice and reduces the environmental risks to the low-income tenants.

This was the first Regional consent decree under TSCA to address PCB contamination at natural gas pipeline compressor stations and ancillary facilities. Additionally, the decree required groundwater monitoring; submission of procedures for the use, handling, storage and disposal of PCB-contaminated liquids during pipeline operations; installation of source control measures; that the company provide an oversight contractor to monitor compliance of the terms of the consent decree for EPA; and the payment of a penalty of $375,000.

Region 1 is seeking $980,220 in total penalties 1 for the violations. These complaints are part of EPAs multi-media environmental initiative in the Catano region of Puerto Rico. In the Matter of Crown Metals, Inc.; An EPA administrative law judge issued an Initial Decision in this case involving three separate violations of 5313 of EPCRA. The complaint alleged that respondents had failed to timely submit its EPCRA Forms R for three chemicals it had used at its Kenilworth, New Jersey facility. A hearing was held in October 1989, during which, pursuant to EPAs oral motion, the judge entered a finding of partial liability for reporting failures. The hearing then focused entirely upon the amount of an appropriate penalty. EPA sought $5,000 for each violation. An administrative law judge ordered respondent to pay $1,500 altogether, $500 per violation. The judge's decision was based upon a series of earlier decisions that similarly had rejected the reasoning in EPA's December 2, 1988 penalty policy. Respondent had filed the Forms on September 15,1988. Under the 1988 policy, a Form R submitted after the July 1st deadline and which is also submitted after EPA has contacted the 3-59</p><p>facility is nonetheless considered a &quot;failure to report&quot; for purposes of assessing a penalty. As had several other, administrative law judges, this judge refused to enforce this provision. The judge's reasoning parallels that of the other ALJs: the size of the penalty should be proportionate to the extent of the delay in providing the report, regardless of whether or not there has been intervening EPA contact with the facility. Since the reports in question here were ten weeks late, the judge assessed the figure that the 1988 penalty policy matrix assigns for such reports where no EPA contact with the facility has occurred. In addition, the judge emphasized that, at the time of Crown Metal's violation, the EPCRA program had just been initiated and that respondent had undertaken &quot;significant efforts to determine its own responsibilities under the new program&quot;. In June 1993, the ten EPA Regions issued civil administrative complaints seeking $2.8 million against thirty-seven facilities for failures to file Form Rs under 5 313 of EPCRA. The facilities cited include a wide variety of industries, including paper manufacturers, motor vehicle manufacturers, makers of railroad equipment, makers of ammunition, and many others. Region V issued eleven administrative complaints as part of the initiative, with total proposed penalties of over $1 million. EPCRA s313 established the Toxics Release Inventory and requires certain U.S. facilities to report by each July 1 their releases and hansfers of almost 400 listed toxic chemicals.

The complaint further alleged that Lilly's EPCRA §304(c) follow-up notifications, submitted between one week and three months after the release, were not &quot;as soon as practicable.&quot; It is extremely important in EPCRA enforcement to litigate the issue of immediate notification, as the purpose of law is to provide for immediate response, if necessary. In the Matter of Mobil Oil C o p : On August 13, 1993, Region I1 executed consent orders resolving nearly all counts contained in three administrative complaints issued against Mobil for violations of EPCRA 5304 and CERCLA 5103 at its Paulsboro, N.J. facility. The orders provide for payment of penalties totaling $35,000. One remaining count could not be settled. An adjudicatory hearing was held, also in August, 1993, on both liability and penalty issues with respect to that count; a decision is pending. The settlements arose out of Region II's successful Motion for Partial Accelerated Decision in the three cases, which EPA Chief Administrative Law Judge Frazier, granted without qualification on September 30, 1992. That motion addressed two legal questions: (1) what is a &quot;federally permitted release,&quot; and (2) what is &quot;immediate&quot; notification to the National Response Center (&quot;NRC&quot;) pursuant to §103(a) of CERCLA. What constitutes a &quot;federally permitted&quot; air release was an issue of first impression. Mobil argued that so long as a facility has an air emissions permit, the EPCRA and CERCLA reporting requirements do not apply to it, even where the air release exceeds the quantity</p><p>Kemira agreed to a 525,000 penalty and to perform two supplemental environmental projects.

This involves the installation of a 51.4 million sulfur dioxide scrubber system in its Savannah facility's calciner system. In addition, Kemira agreed to make a 5100,000 cash contribution to the Georgia State Emergency Response Commission for the 3-61</p><p><b><b>FY IYY3 Enforcernent Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p>authorized by a permit. This argument was based on the use of different statutory language to define federally permitted air releases, as opposed to federally permitted releases into other media. While the statute exempts air releases that are &quot;stibject to&quot; a permit or control regulation, the statute exempts releases regulated by other federal regulatory programs, such as the Clean Water Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, only where the subject releases are &quot;in coinpliance w i t h permits or control regulations. EPA attempted to clarify this apparent ambiguity by issuing a 1988 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&quot;NPRM&quot;) which explicitly addressed this issue. The NPRM however, does not have the force of law, and Mobil accordingly challenged EPA's interpretation. Judge Frazier dedicated 31 pages of his decision to the federally permitted release issue and found EPA's interpretation to be eminently reasonable and consistent with the purposes of both CERCLA and EPCRA.

(Conway,</p><p><b>Ark.): In an Interlocutory Order issued on March</b><br/>18, 1993, Chief Administrative Law Judge Frazier ruled on a controversial issue in the EPCRA 5313 program. Section 313 requires the reporting of the releases of certain chemicals for the Toxics Release Inventory. The issue was whether a facility has violated the 5313 requirements and should be penalized when the facility's best information, at the time the Form R was required to be submitted to EPA, indicated that it was Mt required to report for the chemical, although the facility later received clear information showing that it should have reported. San Antonio Shoe admitted that it did know that acetone was in the product, but claimed that it did not know the percentage of acetone. EPA argued that because of this knowledge, San Antonio Shoe knew, or should have known, that the acetone in the product was &quot;otherwise used&quot;, and thus had a duty to make an investigation about the percentage of acetone in the product. San Antonio Shoe claimed to have received a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) showing the acetone content of the product being used only after the 1988 Form R was required to be filed but before the 1989 Form R was due. The judge ruled that after receipt of the MSDS, San Antonio Shoe was liable for penalties. The judge found, however, that San Antonio Shoe was not liable for penalties with respect to similar failures to report for 1987 and 1988 for the same substance, and he dismissed the complaint with respect to these allegations. In dismissing those violations, Judge Frazier noted that San Antonio Shoe did not have information indicating that it was required to report for acetone for 1987 and 1988 until &quot;long after&quot; the Forms R were due. He held, &quot;there is no requirement in the EPA regulations that facilities, which acquire the necessary information described in 5372.30(b)(3)(iii)after the due date of a Form R, retroactively recalculate its releases to include the additional amounts of a toxic chemical that may have been</p><p>On the issue of whether Mobil had immediately notified the NRC, Judge Frazier found that Mobil delayed approximately 26 hours where the statute unambiguously requires immediate notification.

Of specific concern is the possibility that solvents and heavy metals from the facility may be leaching into the already seriously contaminated groundwater in the area. Furthermore, the facility may be contributing to the pollution of nearby Lake Calumet. The Sherwin-Williams facility that is subject to this action is a 123-acre facility which is located in an area where there are numerous other sources of pollution and where the surrounding neighborhood is largely populated with African Americans as well as people of lower income levels. At this facility, Sherwin-Williams manufactures both solvent based and latex paints. In the past, the company has also manufactured or used resins, varnishes, lacquers, and other substances that have contributed to the environmental problems at the site. This action was brought as a result of an inspection which revealed violations including the illegal management of hazardous waste without a permit or interim status, the use of improperly closed, marked, and inspected tanks and containers, and the failure to maintain adequate waste analysis and 'contingency plans.

The complaint proposes the assessment of a civil penalty in the amount of $101,062. On March 31, 1993, representatives of EPA conducted a RCRA compliance evaluation inspection (CEI) at the NCBC. On the basis of this inspection, EI'A determined that the respondent failed to properly conduct hazardous waste determinations, failed to include the EPA hazardous waste number and corresponding waste treatment standard on the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) Notice, failed to retain copies of LDR notices on site for certain shipments of waste restricted from land disposal, failed to provide annual hazardous waste training to its employees who manage hazardous waste, failed to maintain a written hazardous waste training program and other required records for all personnel who handle or manage hazardous waste, failed to label hazardous waste containers with the dates of accumulation, and failed to conduct weekly container inspections.</p><p>activities. In March 1993, EPA learned that Reese had detected trichloroethylene above safe drinking water standards in some privatelyowned drinking water wells near the Base. After confirming the data, EPA issued an agreed-on administrative order under 57003 of RCRA on June 1, 1993. The order requires the Base to collect water samples from water wells in a 36 square mile area (within a 2 mile perimeter of the Base) in order to determine the extent of the contamination, to notify the owners of any contamination, to supply an alternate source of drinking water to the residents with contaminated wells, and to monitor the ground water in and adjacent to the plume. Reese has completed the initial sampling of about 950 wells, provided carbon filters for all the impacted water wells, and connected some of the users to the City of Lubbock's water system. The city is in the process of connecting its water lines to the residents that live within the city limits.

Action Manufacturing Co. of Atglen, Pa., was sentenced September 2, 1993. The company paid $100,000 of the fine at sentencing, with $400,000of the fine suspended pending completion of a five-year period of probation. Terms of probation include clean up of the &quot;burn pits&quot; under the direction of EPA and compliance with a debarment compliance agreement negotiated among Action, EPA, and the Department of Defense. Action manufactures explosives primarily for the U.S. government, and failure to comply with the terms of the probation will result in debarment. Following a joint criminal investigation by EPA, the FBI, and the Army CID, the company was charged with illegally disposing of hazardous waste for several years by pouring liquid and sludge wastes resulting from explosives manufacturing into &quot;bum pits&quot; and igniting the material. At about the same time, EPA was overseeing a CERCLA response action, and EPA then negotiated a debarment compliance agreement because the company, in shaky financial condition already, would go out of business if it was debarred, leaving no choice but for the government to pay for a site clean up. At sentencing, the judge noted that incorporation of the compliance agreement and clean up provisions in the plea agreement was &quot;a hammer&quot; over the company that caused him to approve the terms of the plea.</p><p>The 1990 Polllition Prosecution Act called for no less thnn 110 criminal investigators on board dirring 1993.

The Aerolite Chrome Corporation had been convicted on December 11, 1990, for ten felony violations of CWA pretreatment requirements, involving discharges of large volumes of wastewater contaminated by metal processing to a public sewer system flowing to the publicly owned Reno-Sparks treatment works.

But the company president and sole agent of the corporation involved in the illegal acts, Arthur Thomas, was acquitted by the jury on all counts, so the corporation appealed asserting that it too must be acquitted as a matter of law. The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that an apparently inconsistent verdict could easily be as wrong against the government as against the defendant, or could in actuality be the result of jury lenity toward the individual defendant, and that there was ample testimony supporting the corporation's conviction for the illegal acts of its agent Thomas.</p><p><b>Y.S. v.</b></p><p>US. v.Taria m a d . et &amp;(C.D.

On May 21, 1993, defendants Robert M. Brittingham and John J. LoMonaco were sentenced to pay a total of $12 million for violations of RCRA. Brittingham must pay a $4 million fine, LoMonaco must pay a $2 million fine, and together they must pay $6 million into a trust account set up to administer a lead abatement community service project. Each defendant also received a five-year term of probation, during which they each must spend a substantial number of hours weekly to implement the community service project. The project is designed to abate the City of Dallas’ lead problem and its effects on children by funding educational awareness programs on lead exposure and by testing children who may suffer learning disabilities as a result of lead exposure. The defendants must also place an advertisement in a widely-circulated trade journal describing their violations of environmental requirements. Brittingham was former chairman of the board and part owner, and LOMOMCO president and was a former board member, of their former company, Dal-Tde Corporation, which was sold to an investment group in 1990.

Although laws require that heavy metals, like lead, must be disposed of in an approved hazardous waste disposal facility, and even after Dal-Tile employees warned Brittingham and LoMonaco that the sludge was toxic and being disposed of illegally, Brittingham and LoMonaco ordered that the toxic sludge be dumped in a gravel pit in the Dallas suburb of Seagonville.</p><p>Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a new trial.

The case proceeded to trial on February 1, 1993. Four defendants (Craven Labs, Craven, Hamerly and Harris) moved for a mistrial after learning that one of the Government's witnesses had spoken to a juror, and had discussed being nervous about testifying. Peterson objected to the mistrial, and indicated that he was ready to proceed with the case with the jury that was sitting. After the court granted the defense motion for a mistrial for all defendants, all five defendants moved to acquit or dismiss the Indictment, claiming that the mistrial was the result of bad faith or Government misconduct. The court ruled that the mistrial was not the result of any bad faith on the part of the Government, and denied the defense motions. The defendants then filed Motions for Acquittal and/or Motions for Dismissal of the Indictment, claiming that jeopardy will attach if the defendants were retried. When these motions were denied, the defendants appealed to the Fifth Circuit. On September 9, 1993, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court, and sent the case back to the district court for retrial.

The defendants knew that their use of the pesticide was illegal, and their sentence included the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the US.for the unlawful use of pesticides.<br/>On February 17, 1993, the company (having previously pled guilty to five FIFRA and five</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p>felony mail fraud counts) was fined $400,000 and sentenced to five years of probation. Alan Chesler and Andrew Chesler (each having pled guilty to five counts of FIFRA) were each fined $25,000 and sentenced to five years of supervised probation. Despite the knowledge that application of Direx to waterways was illegal, the defendants regularly so used it because of its effectiveness in destroying certain types of vegetation. In addition to the FIFRA violations, the company used the U.S. mails to solicit and attempt to solicit customers with written contracts which falsely represented that it used only EPA approved products in removing and controlling unwanted aquatic vegetation and algae growth. i - m D. CT.L: On September 13, 1993, two days before trial was to begin, Victor Figueroa, a/k/a Victor Figueroa-Soto, pleaded guilty to disposing of hundreds of unlabeled bags of asbestos in a concealed storage room in a basement on Bartholomew Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. During his change of plea, Figueroa acknowledged that in the Spring of 1991, he assisted others in removing asbestos from the upper floors of the Hartford building and placing it in a vacant basement storage room. The room was then sealed shut with cinder blocks and mortar and painted to match the surrounding basement walls. His activities resulted in asbestos contamination throughout the building. Ultimately, the building owner retained other asbestos abatement contractors to properly dispose of the asbestos in the basement and decontaminate the building. As part of the plea, the remaining counts against Figueroa and all of the counts against the company have been dismissed. This case began when an EPA received a tip about a suspicious removal operation and the possible concealment of asbestos. That tip ultimately led the government to obtain a warrant to search the facility and break into the concealed storage room. On July 12,1991, EPA executed the search warrant using a sledge hammer to break through the cinder block wall. EPA discovered unlabeled bags of asbestos, much of it dry, piled to the ceiling.</p><p>CWA by falsifying aquatic toxicology tests. On July 1,1993, Randall Ford was sentenced to three years of probation, 200 hours of community service, and to pay $15,ooO in restitution.

His employer, Cargill, Inc., which had not purchased the necessary lab organisms to conduct the tests, suspected the falsification, conducted an internal investigation, reported the situation to EPA, and subsequently terminated Fords employment.<br/>Y.S. v.

The &quot;fertilizer&quot; was made with baghouse dust, a hazardous waste removed from air pollution control equipment in the United States and toxic for lead and cadmium under RCRA regulations. Between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of this material was applied directly by hand to food crops in Bangladesh. Discovery of the incident resulted in international controversy involving foreign governments, environmental groups, the United States government and the Asian Development Bank. Although some charges are still pending, and any defendant must be presumed innocent until proven or pleading guilty, this case is reported now. The case is a matter of considerable public interest, and it is important to let the world know that a number of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. On November 1, 1993, Gaston Copper Recycling Corporation (Gaston) and Southwire Company (Southwire) were sentenced. Gaston was ordered to pay $600,000, which the judge said may be used to treat or dispose of the portion of the fertilizer that is still in storage in Bangladesh, and to pay $200,000 to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Southwire was fined $190,000. Both companies were sentenced to two years of probation, ordered to perform environmental assessment studies on their facilities, and ordered to publish in newspapers a formal apology to the people of South Carolina. On December 22, 1992, Gaston and Southwire each pled guilty to eight counts of violating TSCA. Southwire executive Bruce E. Betterton also pled guilty on December 22, 1992, to a single TSCA violation. On November 1, 1993, Betterton was fined $10,000 and sentenced to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. The three defendants' TSCA violations were for failing to report to EPA the distribution in commerce of a chemical substance or mixture while possessing information that it presents a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.</p><p>violation of RCRA. Their sentencing is pending. Stoller Chemical Company (Stoller) of Jericho, S.C., was the manufacturer of micro-nutrients used to enhance fertilizer. Weaver was the General Manager of Stoller, and the person responsible for ordering materials for the plant. Heinel is the President and owner of Hy-Tex Marketing, a hazardous waste broker, located in Beaufort, S.C. In return for a $50,000 kick- back from Heimel, Weaver and Heimel caused baghouse dust (with a total lead content as high as thirty-one percent) to be transported without a hazardous waste manifest from Gaston, S.C., to Stoller's Jericho plant. Stoller then mixed this hazardous waste with other material, some of which was another hazardous waste, to produce 3,000 tons of contaminated micro-nutrient fertilizer which was then exported overseas. The export of the new mixture, which was also hazardous waste characteristically toxic for lead and cadmium, occurred without the required consent of the receiving country, Bangladesh. Stoller was indicted in 1992 and is now in bankruptcy. Southwire is headquartered in Carrollton, Georgia and is the primary stockholder of Gaston, a company that operates a copper recycling plant in Gaston, S.C. Betterton is a corporate executive of Southwire and participated in the management of the baghouse dust generated at the Gaston plant. In September and October of 1991, Gaston generated and shipped baghouse dust to Stoller while having knowledge, including their own material safety data sheet, that the baghouse dust presented a health hazard because it contained high concentrations of lead and cadmium; the dust can be toxic by ingestion and inhalation. This case involved significant federal, state and local cooperation. EPA was assisted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's Criminal Investigation Division, by the Charleston County, South Carolina, Sheriff's Department, and in Australia and Bangladesh by the US.Customs Service that obtained key samples and conducted liaison with foreign governments.

The court held that a fourpoint offense level increase under the Sentencing Guidelines for disposal without a permit applied to a defendant convicted of unlawful industrial waste discharge, even if he could not have obtained a permit for his conduct due to his use of improper equipment, and that the vacating of defendant's initial sentence did not preclude (at the time of resentencing) offense-level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on perjured testimony given a t the original sentencing hearing.</p><p>In a closely related case, on February 1 , 1993, 1 Ronald L. Voda, Sr., owner of Voda Petroleum Company of White Oak, Texas, was sentenced to 60 days of incarceration, 120 days at a halfway house, 400 hours of community service, a $3,000.00 fine, and five years of probation. In 1987, Ronald Voda and his company entered into an agreement with Goldfaden. In return for a payment by Goldfaden of $.lo for each gallon of waste listed on the paperwork regardless of whether or not it came to the Voda Petroleum plant, Voda signed trip tickets and hazardous waste manifests falsely certifying that Voda Petroleum Company received waste. Much of the waste listed on these papers was dumped illegally into sewer system in the Dallas area by Control Disposal Company.<br/>On February 10, 1989, while executing a search warrant at Voda Petroleum, EPA agents observed a ditch cut through a levee surrounding a process area a t the plant. Wastewater was being discharged from this ditch that exceeded limits set for oil and grease in Voda's NPDES permit. Voda's plea agreement with the government allowed him to plead to a CWA misdemeanor in return for his cooperation and testimony in all proceedings involving Control Disposal Company and Herman Goldfaden.</p><p>Goldfaden's recent, failed appeal followed his earlier appeal in this case, in which Goldfaden had successfully obtained a ruling by the Fifth Circuit on April 22, 1992, that vacated his first sentence (to three years imprisonment and a $75,000 fine, imposed July 16,1991) and remanded the case for resentencing or withdrawal of his plea agreement. Goldfaden pled guilty to one CWA felony for the 1989 unpermitted discharge of industrial wastewater into a private sewer in East Dallas, from which it flowed into a sewer. His former company, Control Disposal Co., Inc., which he controlled, was in the business of cleaning grease and sludge traps and sewer lines. The company pled guilty to the same CWA violation and also a RCRA violation for falsifying documents on a shipment of hazardous waste. The RCRA violation occurred in 1988, when Control D'isposal workers hauled waste from the city of University Park. Although city officials told them that the waste was hazardous used paint thinner, mostly methyl chloride, the company misrepresented the waste on federal forms as being hydraulic fluid that can be disposed of more cheaply. The case was investigated in a cooperative effort of EPA, the Water Utilities and the Health and Human Services Departments of the City of Dallas, and the FBI. 3-82</p><p>Y.S. v .S a (E.D.

On November 8, 1993, in the first criminal prosecution ever to enforce the provisions of a n international treaty that prohibits the disposal of plastics at sea, the operators of a large &quot;fish-factory'' vessel were sentenced to pay a $150,000 fine over a five-year period, with $50,000 to be paid on the day of sentencing, and to a five-year term of probation. On April 13, 1993, the lrene Joint Venture, dba Golden Age Fisheries, entered its plea of guilty to a charge of knowing disposal of plastics into the sea in July 1989. At the time of the offense, the Michelle Lreae Joint Venture was composed of three Washington-State corporations, namely, Westcod 11, Inc., Simonson Enterprises V, Inc., and BTI IV, Inc. These business partners were held subject to the conditions of the five-year term of probation. The dumping of plastics by American flag vessels was outlawed on December 31, 1988, with the impkmentation of Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of Ships, known as the MARPOL Protocol, adopted in accordance with the Act to Prevent Pollution at Sea from Ships. Former crew members provided information to EPA that they had dumped plastics overboard under orders from management while the vessel was at sea beginning in December 1988. The vessel is a 253-foot fishprocessor that uses large quantities of plastic bags, liners, straps, and containers. Although the vessel was equipped with a state-of-the-art incinerator capable of burning plastic, a fire shortly after it left port in December 1988 rendered the incinerator virtually inoperable during the time of the dumping at sea.</p><p>caused over 100 people to receive medical treatment for exposure to the fumes, and caused a nearby freeway to be closed. The spill occurred at a facility owned by a national truck carrier, headquartered in Florida. At the sentencing on March 18, 1993, the judge said that earlier notification would have speeded up the cleanup and helped prevent aggravating the situation. Gordon D. Babbitt, a former Vice President of MongomeIy Tank Lines, Inc. (MTL), was sentenced to one year in jail (nine months suspended), a fine of $120,000, and two years of probation. He pleaded guilty to a CERCLA felony charge of failing to promptly report the spill. MTL also pleaded guilty to the CERCLA charge, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $150,000, to reimburse the government for cleanup costs, resolve citizen claims against MTL arising from the spill, and to pay a $4,000 fine to the Gary Indiana Sanitary District. Three other MTL employees pleaded guilty to CWA misdemeanor violations for allowing the acid to enter the sewer system, and were sentenced to fines of $2,500 each, and in one case to a one year term of probation. The spill occurred a t a tank storage facility owned by MTL, and used by the Gary Products Co. The president of Gary Products, William Keagle, who was indicted in 1990 for his failure to immediately report the spill, previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation. The investigation continued and determined that the MTL defendants had tried to hide their knowledge of the spill and even their role in arranging for the acid to be shipped to the facility.</p><p><b>Y.S.v.

In 1993, the US. government initiated a proceeding to enforce the terms of probation imposed after a 1988 conviction of Orkin for FIFRA violations that resulted in the death from pesticide poisoning of an elderly Virginia couple. On June 1, 1993, the court fined Orkin $35,000 for having violated the terms of its probation.

Pohl generated hazardous waste at the metal plating facility in Albuquerque from 1985 to 1989. Operations involved the electrolytic plating methods used to introduce the metallic phase onto circuit boards. The process involved dipping boards into acidic solutions containing heavy metals. Solvents were used to clean and dry the boards and printing inks were used for labels. During this time, Pohl stored listed and characteristic hazardous wastes'on site. Pohl also improperly discharged lead contaminated wastewater into the City of Albuquerque's sewer system. On several occasions, Pohl received information from the State of New Mexico and City of Albuquerque regarding the proper management of hazardous waste. In 1989, Pohl ceased operations and abandoned the facility.

Facts brought out at the sentencing hearing were that in the spring of 1992, Smith directed an employee to illegally dump approximately 12 barrels of contaminated waste oil at two sites. Four barrels leaked at one site causing over $18,000 in cleanup and site remediation costs. Smith also pleaded no contest to the charge of illegal management of hazardous waste at his auto repair shop. The case was significant for the several reasons. It was the first State environmental criminal case involving actual jail time for the defendant.

VOCs are known precursors in the formation of ozone and the Coors brewery is located within the Denver ozone non-attainment area. The emission of VOCs from CBC is estimated to exceed 1,000 tons per year, making this a major source of VCC emissions and subject to non-attainment area new source review permitting requirements. This case is of national interest because the actual emissions from the facility are substantially higher than previously assumed by regulatory agencies and is likely to result in the fact that many large breweries across the country are major, rather than minor, sources of VOCs. This is very significant for such sources that are located in ozone non-attainment areas, as many older breweries are, as well as for PSD permitting in attainment areas. EPA is considering a national brewery enforcement initiative as a result.</p><p><b>3-94</b></p><p><b>,.</b></p><p><b>. :,</b></p><p><b>I, &gt;.</b></p><p><b>..</b></p><p><b><b>FY I993 Enjorcenmt Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p><b>Delaware</b></p><p>AA Waste Oil Service: On August 19,1993, Paul Levers, owner, and Jay Morris, employee, of'the<br/>AA Waste Oil Service were convicted of criminal charges (D.

In addition, Levers will be required to perform 200 hours of community service, and Morns, 100 hours. This is a case of &quot;midnight dumping&quot; that occurred in broad daylight. Levers directed employee Jay Morris to discharge oily water from an AA Waste Oil Vehicle into a drain of a wash bay at the Harrington Car Wash. The discharge occurred when Morris pretended to wash the vehicle, but was actually discharging the oily waste water from heating oil tanks that had been collected by AA Waste Oil. AA customers paid up to $1.00 per gallon to have the water removed from their underground heating oil tanks. Levers directed the discharge of the water so that AA Waste Oil would not have to pay $0.50 per gallon to a certified company to dispose of the waste water properly. The oily water discharge was traced from the drain of the car wash to a storm water ditch from where it eventually empties into the Delaware Bay.

Inc. dlbig Austill Packaging vI State Department of Environmental Regulation (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App.): This is a case involving postjudgment proceedings to enforce payment of stipulated penalties in a consent final judgment against Smurfit Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Austill Packaging Plant in Jacksonville is a subsidiary of Smurfit. Air Pollution Rules promulgated by the Florida and the City of Jacksonville required Smurfit to install and operate emission control equipment to reduce VOC emissions at the Austill plant in Jacksonville by no later than the end of 1982. Smurfit did not comply with the rules, and installed no pollution control equipment. In 1983, the FDER with the City of Jacksonville as coplaintiff sued in circuit court for enforcement of the rules and for civil penalties. EPA filed its own administrative proceeding against Smurfit. The parties agreed to a settlement in the early part of 3-95</p><p>1985. EPA, though not a party to the state lawsuit, signed the Stipulation. Smurfit was required to show compliance with the laws and rules regulating air pollution by the end of 1985. Smurfit &quot;sold&quot; the Austill plant to Austill Packaging Company on October 1,1985. In 1987, the FDER along with the City of Jacksonville filed a Motion for Penalties, alleging Smurfit had violated the consent final judgment by failing to pay the stipulated penalties. The circuit court rejected Smurfit's defenses, and enforced the stipulated penalties provision by awarding the face amount of the stipulated penalties. The circuit court entered its Order Enforcing Final Judgment and Adjudging Penalties on June 13,1991. Smurfit appealed the decision, challenging the trial court's interpretation of relevant provisions of the consent final judgment and the existence of competent substantial evidence to support the decision. A cross-appeal filed by the FDER and the City of Jacksonville challenged the trial court's interpretation of the penalties provision. The penalties provision called for doubling the amount of penalties in the event of non-payment. The appellate opinion filed June 15, 1993, affirmed the lower court decision. The &quot;sale&quot; of the plant did not relieve Smurfit of its obligation to demonstrate compliance and pay the stipulated penalties. The appellate court held there was competent substantial evidence to support the factual findings of the trial court and that the trial court's interpretation of the judgment was not unreasonable. Furthermore, the trial court had discretion to decide whether doubling of penalties was appropriate. Payment in full to the FDER has been made in the amount of $1,661,649.

Finally it had been exceeding the allowable standard for discharge of VOC to the atmosphere from its coating mixture since July 1 1982. Operation of , each source without a permit is a violation of the Florida Administrative Code. By failing to utilize reasonably available control technology, Sun Graphic failed to limit discharge of VOC into the atmosphere. By signing a stipulation of settlement, Sun Graphic agreed to pay Florida, $205,000,and add additional collection devises to capture fugitive emissions of VOC at its lithographic facility in Pompano Beach. iXy of Vero BeacM Indian River County, FL): On June 17,1993,a Consent Order between FDER and the City of Vero Beach (respondent), a municipality engaged in the generation end distribution of electric power, was filed allowing the respondent to implement an in-kind project in lieu of a cash payment in settlement of matters arising from violations of the Florida Air and Water Pollution Control Act.

An administrative case was also pursued for the violations and a penalty of $25,000 was agreed to by the company in September of 1993. The company is a rotogravure printing company located in Baltimore City, which is in a severe ozone non-attainment area. Maryland regulations for the control of air pollution for this type of facility require a 65% reduction of VOC emissions from sources with VOC emissions exceeding 550 pounds daily. Alfords emissions exceed this 550 pound level, therefore, they are required to reduce emissions by 65%. Alford reduces VOC emissions by ducting fumes from their printing lines into two afterburners. A copy of an internal company memo was anonymously received by MDE in the f$Il of 1992. The memo indicated that the company was aware of some problems with its air pollution control system that would cause violations of Maryland air pollution regulations. A subsequent inspection of the plant by MDE established that an insufficient amount of fumes from the printing lines were being ducted to the afterburners. This resulted in less than the required 65% reduction being achieved. Based on this inspection and data about the Company’s emissions, a criminal case was pursued in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The violations were corrected in the spring of 1993, after the company became aware of the MDE investigation.

Wheeling-Pittsburoh Steel : The EPA, The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council had originally filed a complaint in federal court against Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation for five years worth of NPDES permit violations and spill events at the Allenport Plant on the Monongahela River. Wheeling-Pittsburgh promised the Department that it could settle with the agency if the Department would do so outside the Federal suit. The Department withdrew from the Federal suit and Wheeling-Pittsburgh failed to settle. The Department filed a separate complaint before the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board for $2.2 million.

The two military organizations voluntarily complied and all others appealed from the Orders. The Department, the carriers, and Allegheny county have a settlement whereby the carriers agreed to pay a civil penalty of approximately $60,000, to construct remote deicing pads with collection systems (some are already complete and in use) so that spent fluids may be hauled and treated, and agreed to try alternative materials on the runways, ramps, and taxiways as anti-skid materials.

On April 4, 1991, the State issued an order requiring the site be secured (fenced) and the owners to submit and implement an investigation plan and remedial action plan for the site. By April, 1992, Witherspoon, Inc. declared that it was unable to clean up the site. Since that time, over one million dollars has been spent by the State and the Department of Energy in an effort to assess and remediate the environmental damage. During the time this effort was underway, the respondents allowed additional hazardous wastes to be released in the environment. As recently as August, 1993, the Witherspoon respondents have been responsible for the disposal of contaminated materials on site. The results of the October 1993 injunctive action was precedent setting in that this was the first judicial action in which Tennessee has taken legal possession of property. In the case of the Witherspoon Site, this action was taken in order to eliminate continuing disposal of contaminated materials and to maintain control of the site while efforts to investigate and remediate the site are underway. The resulting temporary restraining order, prevents the Witherspoon respondents from accessing the property.

Goose Creek, which flows through and off the site property, also flows through Mary Vestal Park, a municipal community playground. The facility and site, a salvage company in operation since the 1940's, is contaminated by radioactive ;U-234, heavy metals (lead, mercury), mixed wastes and organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). During the years of operation the facility was not licensed or permitted to store, treat or dispose of hazardous waste.

Federal Facilities Enforcement and Federal Activities</b><br/>Office of Federal Facilities Enforcement<br/>EPA's Federal Facility Enforcement and Compliance Program, managed by the O f i c e of Federal Facilities Enforcement (OWE), promotes protection of human health and the environment by expeditiously cleaning up and ensuring compliance at federal hazardous and radioactive waste sites. OFFE is establishing a framework that ensures the federal government is accountable to the public for its environmental record. In recognition of the public's vital interests, OFFE will work to further engage the public with the federal sector in the decision making process for management and cleanup of environmental contamination at federal facilities.<br/>In 1993, the Office of Federal Facilities Enforcement (OFFE) continued to ensure federal government compliance with all environmental laws. The federal government manages a vast array of industrial activities at its 27,000 installations. These activities present unique management problems from the standpoint of compliance with federal environmental statutes. Although federal facilities are only a small percentage of the regulated community, many federal installations are larger and more complex than private facilities and often present a greater number of sources of pollution in all media. The federal government is investing significant resources in addressing environmental cleanup and compliance issues at federal facilities. Superfund Cleanuo At the start of EPAs federal facilities enforcement program, EPA directed its resources largely to the completion of negotiations for CERCLA 5 120 interagency agreements. These agreements made up the cornerstone of the enforcement program addressing the 123 final and 20 proposed federal facilities listed on the National Priorities List (NPL). Each agreement contained specific schedules for the study and cleanup of hazardous substances at these facilities. During FY 1993, six additional federal facility CERCLA interagency agreements (IAGs) were executed. Of the federal facilities listed on the NPL at the end of FY 1993, 110 are now covered by agreements. With the majority of these agreements completed, EPA now concentrates most of its efforts on the their implementation. The number of accomplishments reported by the regions reflects that work has proceeded into the implementation phase. For example, the Regions reported 50 RODS signed in FY 1993. In addition, they have reported 43 remedial design starts, 30 remedial design completions, 23 remedial action starts and 15 remedial action completions. EPA anticipates that with more work moving through the study and cleanup phase, more issues will arise leading to disputes between EPA and federal agencies. In FY 1993, two major disputes arose under IAGs at George and Mather Air Force Bases that were decided by the Administrator. The disputes presented difficult issues regarding cleanup standards based on California's non-degradation policy. The Administrator's decision resolving these disputes stressed that EPA and the Air Force were to apply the state's policy, and the interpretation of the policy. Three cases were settled in FY 1993 involving violations of the terms of IAGs at Loring Air Force Base in Maine, Fernald in Ohio, and the West Virginia Ordnance Works Site. The settlement of these cases included over $500,000 in penalties and, in one case, as supplemental environmental project worth $2 million. In February, OFFE issued an interim report by the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Dialogue Committee. The committee is a chartered federal advisory committee and includes forty 4-1</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>representatives of federal agencies, tribal and state governments and associations, and local and national environmental, community, and labor organizations. EPA established the committee in 1992 to develop consensus policy recommendations aimed at improving the federal facilities environmental restoration decision process to ensure that clean-up decisions reflect the priorities and concerns of all stakeholders. The interim report contained committee recommendations concerning: improving the dissemination of federal facility restoration information; improving stakeholder involvement in key restoration decisions with special emphasis on the use of site-specific advisory boards; and improving consultation on federal facility restoration funding decisions and setting priorities in the event of funding shortfalls. Federal Facilitv Comoliance Act The Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA), amending RCRA, became effective in N 1993. The law greatly enhances state and EPA enforcement authorities against federal facilities. For example, states and EPA can now assess and collect penalties for violations of RCRA requirements. In addition, EPA now has authority to issue administrative orders against federal facilities for enforcement of RCRA. During FY 1993, EPA took several significant steps in implementing the FFCA and exercising its new grants of authority. For example, EPA issued hearing procedures for adjudication and appeals to the Administrator for EPA-issued orders against federal agencies. In May, Region I issued the first X RCRA 5 3008 complaint and compliance order with penalties to a federal facility following passage of the FFCA. The complaint sought $257,580 in penalties for 27 violations at the US.Navy's El Centro, California Naval Air Facility. In June, Region VI negotiated and issued the first RCRA 5 7003 order for cleanup response ever issued against a federal agency. The order, involving Reese Air Force Base, near Lubbock,Texas, also included the first RCRA settlement with stipulated penalties since passage of the FFCA. In N 1993, EPA took 12 RCRA 533008(a) enforcement actions using the new authority granted by the FFCA. Two cases have been resolved, and the remainder are either being negotiated or invoking the hearing process. Under the RCRA illegal operator enforcement initiative, EPA charged several federal facilities with a combined total penalty of over $2 million for RCRA violations. Two Department of Defense bases located near San Antonio, Texas, were charged with posing a threat to the city's only source of drinking water. The initiative was an effort to stop operation of hazardous waste activities without required RCRA permits.</p><p><b>Base Closure and Reuse</b><br/>Pursuant to Congressional mandate, numerous military bases are undergoing realignment or complete closure with the potential for,severe economic impacts on the affected local communities. The timely reutilization of these installations is essential if the economic consequences to the community of losing military and civilian jobs is to be minimized. EPA is currently involved at over seventy of these installations. A plan to mitigate economic dislocation and speed the economic recovery of communities near military bases scheduled for realignment or closure was announced by the Clinton Administration on July 2, 1993. Rapid redevelopment and job creation are top goals of the new initiative. A primary element of the President's plan is a Fast Track Cleanup Program at bases with a high probability of early reuse by the host communities. EPA, DOD,and the states are charged with creating a working<br/>4-2</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement AccomplishmentsReport</b></b></p><p>partnership to implement the Fast Track Cleanup Program with the objectives of &quot;quickly identifying clean parcels for early reuse, selecting appropriate leasing parcels where cleanup is underway, and hastening cleanup.'' In order for EPA to implement the President's Fast Track Cleanup Program, OFFE developed the Model Accelerated Cleanup Program (MAC) and guidance to execute the MAC. The MAC establishes environmental teams to provide EPAs technical expertise to streamline and accelerate the cleanup of closing and realigning bases. The MAC will be led by a senior project manager who will be empowered to make decisions locally and will rely on EPA expertise, breaking from traditional reliance on contractors for technical assistance. Although the MAC process will result in a more efficient process, EPA's work will be more intense. This intensity, however, will be offset in time savings and ultimately more efficient use of EPA and DOD resources. Under a very tight time frame, OFFE worked with DOD to develop a BRAC Cleanup Plan (BCP) Guidebook that provides guidance to the BRAC Cleanup Teams (EPA, DOD, state members) for conducting a 'bottom up review'' of the installation's cleanup program and preparing a comprehensive cleanup plan that is sensitive to the reuse needs of the community and the need for accelerated cleanup. The Base Closure Team also designed a three day BRAC Cleanup Team training course that focuses on teamwork and provides detailed instruction on the conduct of the &quot;bottom up&quot; review and preparation of a BCP.</p><p>OFFE produced two conferences on &quot;Military Base Closure: Accelerating Environmental Restoration,&quot; in Boston, MA and Austin, TX. The focus of the conferences was to develop methods for accelerating the cleanup process at closing military installations in order to facilitate the reuse of those installations. The conference report prepared by the team received wide distribution and serves as guidance on accelerating cleanup.<br/>Pollution Prevention</p><p>On August 3, 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, &quot;Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements.&quot; The Executive Order was signed to challenge the Federal government to become a leader in pollution prevention and to be a good neighbor by providing local and State authorities with information concerning the federal government's use of toxic and hazardous chemicals and extremely hazardous substances. OFFE staff assisted the White House in drafting the Executive Order. The three main elements of the Executive Order are: 1) incorporation of Pollution Prevention into day-to-day operations to &quot;Ensure that all Federal agencies conduct their facility management and acquisition activities so that ... the quantity of toxic chemicals entering any waste stream...is reduced as expeditiously as possible through sources reduction . ; 2) compliance with the Emergency Planning &quot; and Community Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) to &quot;Require Federal agencies to report in a public manner toxic chemicals entering any waste stream from their facilities and to improve local emergency planning, response and accident notification ...&quot;; and 3) federal government support for clean technologies to&quot;He1p encourage markets for clean technologies and safe alternatives..&quot;</p><p><b>..</b></p><p><b>...</b></p><p>There are approximately 40 separate requirements in the executive order and almost half of these have a specific deadline set forth in the order. OFFE co-chaired an EPA work group drafting interpretive guidance on implementation of Executive Order 12856, including compliance and inspections for EPCRA and the Toxic Release Inventory. Over 2,OOO federal facilities will be subject to full compliance with EPCRA, PPA and other Executive Order requirements such as the development of facility-specificpollution prevention plans by December 1995.</p><p><b>4 -3</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Multimedia Initiative Federal facilities are a highly visible sector of the regulated community. Their compliance rates in all media have traditionally been lower than those of the private sector. Based on the need to address the environmental problems in the federal sector, EPA endorsed the Federal Facilities MultiMedia Enforcement Initiative for FY 1993/1994. The goal of the initiative is to improve federal agency compliance and reduce environmental risks from federal facilities through increased use of multi-media inspections; efficient utilization of all available enforcement authorities; and enhanced use of innovative pollution prevention (P2) approaches to solving compliance problems. Many federal agencies currently use a multi-media approach in their internal auditing and compliance evaluations. Multi-media enforcement provides an opportunity for a comprehensive evaluation of a facility by identifying threats to the environment where pollutants cross through various media. Also, multi-media activities provide for an in-depth opportunity for identifying pollution prevention projects that can be implemented as supplemental or beneficial environmental projects at the facility or throughout similar government branches, agencies, departments, and even the private sector. The emphasis is on projects which take pollution prevention approaches to resolving identified violations. Federal agencies will benefit from this initiative by clearly defining their environmental compliance status and the risks the facility poses to human health and the environment. It will provide greater efficiencies for installations by eliminating the resource burden of numerous singlemedia inspections and will serve as an excellent training ground through enhanced EPA technical assistance to federal agency environmental staffs. It will increase the level of environmental awareness of installation employees at all levels, and will help improve federal facilities compliance by providing a comprehensive view of compliance problems and creative opportunities to protect human health and the environment. In FY 1993, EPA and the states conducted 34 multi-media inspections of federal facilities, exceeding by 33% the minimum number of required inspections under the initiative. EPA and the states project a similar level of effort of multi-media investigations at federal facilities in FY 1994. Education and Outreach EPA continued to host the EPA/Federal Agency Environmental Roundtable, where representatives of approximately 50 federal agencies meet monthly to exchange information. At the Roundtable, EPA media experts discuss existing or proposed regulatory approaches affectingcompliance by the other federal agencies. The Roundtable also provides a forum for an exchange of technological information between agencies. In January 1993,to address the specific environmental compliance needs and concerns of civilian federal agencies, which have smaller and .generally more nascent environmental programs than the Departments of Energy and Defense, EPA organized the Civilian Federal Agency Task Force. The task force is addressing problems consistently cited by these civilian agencies, including: inadequate training programs; deficient information resources; outdated compliance tracking and recordkeeping system; shortage of trained professionals with sufficient knowledge and expertise in environmental management and compliance; insufficient assistance from EPA on specific agency issues having a national impact; and inadequate communication and coordination and communication among EPA headquarters, EPA regions and other federal agencies. The task force has made recommendations to address these problem areas and will work, during F 1994,to implement these recommendations.

OFA is the designated agent for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) filing requirements of NEPA. OFA ensures proper documentation and public review. Additionally, OFA is the manager for EPA Memoranda of Understanding (MOW, serving as reviewer and recorder on 77 active MOUs. International Proeram Activities. OFA provides technical assistance for the Agency's international activities. Assistance includes Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) expertise; environmental infrastructure development for developing countries; and coordination with the Department of State, Agency for International Development, and relevant agencies. Indian Proeram. OFA acts as the national program manager for the Multi-Media/Grants Assistance Program for 'Ribes (P.L. 102497); and for providing oversight and guidance of EPAs efforts to extend the national system of environmental protection to Indian lands. Environmental Review Proeram Over the past year OFA has experienced significant progress and precedent setting actions. A partial listing includes:</p><p>Report on NEPA at EPA. OFA chaired a workgroup which examined EPA programs and the National Environmental Policy Act. For the first time in more than two decades, a comprehensive study was made of EPA activities in respect to the key criteria of NEPA -- environmental analysis, consideration of alternatives, and public participation. OFA also considered how the program offices comply with other environmental requirements, such as the Endangered Species Act. The Administrator committed the Agency to this review following Senate hearings on the EPA cabinet bill.<br/>Mid-West Floods. OFA assumed a leadership role in Midwest flood recovery. Serving as EPAs representative to the White House Task Force on levee repair and long-term recovery, OFA promoted a comprehensive approach to floodplain management practices in the region. The principle established by OFA was to learn from past practices to prevent future disasters through long-term floodplain</p><p><b>4-5</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>management. Because of OFAs efforts, the White House is pursuing a strategic assessment of federal activities in floodplains. Everdades. OFA represented EPA at the final negotiations and signing of the multi-agency agreement on restoration of the Everglades. OFA continue to coordinate with Region l , the Office of V Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, and other EPA offices to secure a team of experts to participate in the technical and scientific studies of this complex ecosystem necessary to arrive at a solution for environmentally sustainable development in the region. USGS - BuRec Coordination. As part of its interagency coordination and issue resolution function, OFA continued as Co- Chairs of the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Bureau of Reclamation Committees to exchange information on key issues of pint interest. The meetings of the EPA/USGS Coordinating Committee held this year were successful in coordinating many programs and research efforts. The Bureau of Reclamation/EPA Interagency Coordinating Committee focused on the new directions of the Bureau's water resource management programs with particular emphasis on the Central California project, The Animus LaPlata project in S. W. Colorado, and the San Francisco Bay Delta Water project. Forest Conference. In April 1993, President Clinton convened the Forest Conference which was designed to break the impasse that had developed over use and protection of the Northwest forest resources. From the beginning, OFA has been an active member of the President's Forest Team with particular input in ecosystem protection and watershed management. OFA staff have been involved in both the review and preparation of the Draft Forest Conference Supplemental EIS. Environmental lusticg. OFA provided its expertise on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its potential to further environmental justice awareness by assisting with the development of an Executive Order on Environmental Justice. Independent of that effort, OFA pursued with the Council on Environmental Quality, a pilot study evaluating the thoroughness of analysis of environmentaljustice issues and socioeconomicimpacts under NEPA. Pollution Prevention. OFA developed and issued final guidance to EPA, which was coordinated with all federal agencies, on how pollution prevention can be incorporated into the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Air Act § 309 environmental review processes. The guidance provides specific examples of pollution prevention and mitigation measures that distinguish between source reduction and treatment technologies. Noise Issues. This year began with the completion of an aircraft noise study by the Federal Interagency Committee on Noise. The Report by the committee (OFA was the EPA representative) was part of the resolution of an Federal Aviation Administration project at the Toledo Express Airport. One of the recommendations of this report was to establish a standing Federal interagency committee to coordinate aircraft noise issues. The Federal Interagency Committee on Aircraft Noise has been established and OFA will represent EPA on this committee. OFAs review of DOD and FAA airport EISs is the driving point for their involvement in this issue. Clean Air Act Conformitv Rulemakines. Under the amended Clean Air Act (CAA) EPA was instructed to develop rules for the conformance for federal actions to the CAA. The rules were divided into transportation-related rules and general conformity rules for federal actions which were not FHWA or FTA related. OFA played two critical roles: The first was to craft rules which were not dependent upon NEPA but were complementary to NEPA. The second was to provide continuous feedback on how the rules, throughout their many iterations, might affect the other agencies.<br/>4-6</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Federal Hiphwavs Administration Issues. In the past year, OFA has continued to work with the DOT designated-EPA liaison, to resolve several controversial highway projects. The Appalachian Corridor H project, a proposed 120 mile highway through West Virginia, which would foster economic development for the state was a case in-point. The tiered corridor level approach used by FHWA required an EPA stance to select the environmentally preferable alternative and encourage FHWA to utilize the tiered corridor approach in future projects. The Route 86 project in Riverside County, California required considerable Headquarters attention in order to bridge the pressure to build a 20 year old project with the need for current environmental analysis. Federal Enerw Reeulatorv Commission. In an effort to help the Federal Regulatory Commission __ (FERC) improve the environmental soundness of hydropower licensing and relicensing decisions, OFA coordinated with federal resource agencies to formulate a unified series of recommendations geared to process improvement. Once a consistent view was expressed by federal agencies with an interest in hydropower, FERC became convinced of the need for change. OFA continues to provide advice and assistance in the course of FERC's current relicensing improvement efforts. Outer Continental Shelf Activities. OFA has provided for coordination between EPAs Regions</p><p>IV and VI and the regional and headquarters components of the Minerals Management Service (MMS)<br/>in the preparation of two Supplemental Environmental Impact Statements (SEIS) to address new source general permit issuance for Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities. OFA helped the regions and MMS to overcome jurisdictional and technical disputes to ensure the timely issuance of the documents. EPA could not issue general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for effluent discharges from oil and gas operations in the western, central and eastern Gulf of Mexico until the required NEPA reviews were completed. NEPA Comuliance Endaneered Suecies Activities. As a part of their role to ensure compliance with cross-cutting environmental laws, OFA has been coordinating endangered species issues within the Agency. At the heart of their activities, OFA has been a lead for the Endangered Species Coordinating Committee that was established to describe current activities and obligations, set priorities, establish appropriate training, support and liaison functions with the Fish and Wldlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service. ' Environmental Assessment Guidance &amp; Training. OFA developed guidance materials on environmental assessment to assist both prepares and reviewers of environmental impact assessments. This included a &quot;Sourcebook on the EA process and a related computer program developed by EPA Region V that was designed for self instruction. OFA also began revision of technical guidelines for environmental assessment on proposed fossil fueled steam electric generating stations and coal gasification/petroleum refineries. Work was carried out on EISs for industrial facilities in Texas and Louisiana, power plants in Maine and Florida, off-shore oil and gas NPDES permitting in Regions IV and VI. Historic Preservation. OFA, with the lead on ensuring compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, has been consulting with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in implementing the 1992 Amendments affecting Agency programs delegated to states. Heretofore, these programs were not subject to the Act's provisions. OFA has established an agency-wide workgroup to evaluate the implications for these requirements on states. OFA has also developed training for headquarters and regional staff in the requirements of the law with the cooperation of the Council.</p><p><b>4 -7</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>National Filine Svstems Environmenta1 Review: - In FY 1993,469 environmental impact statements (EISs) were filed with OFA under OFA's delegation from CEQ (286 draft and 183f n l .

OFA began the Multi-Media Assistance Program in FY 1990 with $151,000 for two pilot projects. During FY 1991, $ . of Agency funds were provided to 29 grants 1m to 47 tribes. In FY 1992, 60 new and continuation grants were funded from $5.2M appropriated by Congress including Congressional add-ons for two projects: $1,5m to the 26 Washington tribes for the Washington State Tribal Initiative, and $500K to the Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona (ITCA). During W 1993,100 new and continuation grants were funded from $7.5M appropriated including $35M to the two Congressionally-mandated projects ($2.5M for the Washington tribes; $l.OM for the ITCA). For FY 1994, $8.5 million is available for award to tribal governments and inter-tribal governments and consortia. To date, nearly half the tribes and a quarter of the Alaska Native Villages are receiving capacity building activities. Additionally, OFA held interagency Indian workgroup meetings between EPA and nine Federal agencies. OFA has actively assisted most of the 500+ tribes and Alaskan Native villages who are preparing to bring environmental management to their lands. 4-8</p><p><b><b>FY I993 EnforceinenfAccomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p><b><b>'c! Building and Maintaining a Strong National Enforcement Program</b></b></p><p><b>Proeram DeveloDment</b><br/>National Enforcement Training Institute (NETI)<br/>During FY 1993 NETI made major strides in its continuing effort to develop and offer a comprehensive, integrated approach to enforcement training for federal, state and local environmental enforcement personnel, as mandated by the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-592). NEWS success for the year is reflected in the impressive training statistics: course offerings increased fourfold over the previous year as NET1 offered 200 course sessions, and attendance at NETI-sponsored courses increased by over I20 percent, with 8,375 professionals being trained in FY 1993. Of this number, 4,509 (54%) were state and local employees, and 3866 (46%)were federal employees. NET1 provided training in all ten EPA Regional Offices and Headquarters during the year. NET1 courses were also taught in 20 States: Arizona, California, Florida (3 courses), Georgia, Indiana (2 courses), Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee (2 courses), Texas, Vermont (2 courses), Virginia, and Wisconsin. During FY 1993, NETI significantly expanded its training opportunities that were made available to the international environmental community. NETI offered courses in Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, and Ukraine. These significant increases were made possible by the cooperative partnerships and alliances that NETI has established and fostered within the environmental enforcement community. Training presented under the auspices of NETI in FY 1993 was carried out by the EPA Headquarters and regions, the National Enforcement Investigations Center (NElC), the criminal program at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the EPA program offices, the Northeast Environmental Enforcement Project (NEEP), the Midwest Environmental Enforcement Association (MEEA), the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network (SEEN)and the Western States Project (WSP). In FY 1993 NETI firmly established its organizational structure and network. This network includes the NETI Council--a body of 39 high level representatives from within EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), state and local governments and academia. It also encompasses seven subcommittees of the Council and six independent, standing committees on curriculum development. During the year, NETI launched an extensive effort to revise its prototype two-week Basic Environmental Enforcement Course and produce an operational version. The second session of the prototype was presented in FY 1993 in Washington, D.C., where the focus was upon Region IV. Half of the 36 trainees were from Region IV, EPA Headquarters and DOJ, with the remaining half being from the State and local environmental enforcement agencies in the Region IV area. Following that second presentation, NET1 began an effort to condense the Basic Environmental Enforcement Course into a one-week time frame featuring both classroom instruction and clinical exercise, which would be suitable for delivery by NETI training providers. This effort began in June 1993 with a meeting of a subcommittee of the NET1 Curriculum Committee. This subcommittee is composed of State and Federal expert training professionals, who will be involved throughout the development of the Course. It is anticipated that this Course, which will be offered beginning in June 1994, will become the &quot;basic training&quot; for all new environmental enforcement professionals in the United States. 5-1</p><p><b><b>FY I993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>NETI also revised its BEN and ABEL training in FY 1993 to reflect the changes made within the BEN model's discount rate assumptions, as well as to incorporate a series of improvements to make the training more effective. NETI delivered 14 sessions of the BEN and ABEL Course, training a total of 331 enforcement personnel in EPA Headquarters, 9 Regional Offices, the States of Indiana and Florida, and the Northeast Environmental Enforcement Project. In addition, NETI delivered the Cashout and Superfund ABEL Course, which is essentially the Superfund version of the BEN and ABEL Course, to 120 enforcement personnel at four locations.</p><p>The Integrated Data for Enforcement Analysis (IDEA) is a showcase tool in the arsenal of environmental enforcers. IDEA is an interactive, high-speed data retrieval and integration capability to retrieve data for performing multi-media analyses of regulated facilities for inspection targeting, case screening, case development, litigation support, and settlement negotiations. Fourteen sessions of the IDEA Training Course were offered nationally in FY 1993 to an audience of 235 environmental professionals.<br/>As a follow-on to NETI's international training provided to Mexican environmental inspectors last year, in FY 1993 NETI trained an additional 180 Mexican inspectors in Mexico City and Guadalajara. The fiveday Training Course for Mexican Inspectors was especially designed to meet the needs of the Mexican audience at each specific location. The inspectors benefited from site visits to manufacturing facilities within Mexico. Classroom instruction included in-depth presentations on Mexico's environmental laws and regulations, health and safety techniques for field activities, and the fundamentals of compliance inspections. In addition, detailed reviews of selected industrial processes (e.g., electroplating, printed circuit board manufacturing, furniture finishing, and injection molding) were included in the classroom discussion, which served to reinforce the information that the trainees gleaned from the site visits. The Principles of Environmental Enforcement Course was presented to a total audience of 107 environmental officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Laem Chabang, Thailand; Ankara, Turkey; and Kiev, Ukraine. This intensive, three-day training presented fundamental principles for designing and implementing environmental enforcement programs. Developed in 1991 by EPA, with participation from the Netherlands, Poland, and other countries, this Course is designed for delivery in a wide variety of cultural settings. NETI made significant progress in reaching out to its domestic and international audiences during FY 1993, as well as in making meaningful progress to refine the Institute's internal planning and management functions. Among other things, the Institute developed a vision for NETI's long-term goals by producing the NETI Strategic Plan. NETI also made important strides in becoming a nationally recognized leader in the use of emerging, innovative technologies as vehicles for reaching larger audiences. The NETI Strategic Plan constitutes a comprehensive, detailed blueprint or design that will guide NETI's planning functions in the forthcoming three fiscal years. The Strategic Plan will serve as the basis for the development of yearly Operating Plans that will translate the Strategic Plan's imperatives into attainable actions for each applicable year. NETI aggressively moved forward in FY 1993 into the electronic age of distance education. Distance education utilizes emerging technologies for reaching larger, more widely dispersed audiences. Interactive videos, CD-ROM, and closed-circuit, satellite television transmission are examples of these emerging technologies. During FY 1993, NETI was able to reach simultaneously an audience of 1,000 trainees in 50 States with the Administrative Hearings and Trials Course, by using closed-circuit, satellite transmission with only one instructor for a single day. Also offered via satellite transmission, the Environmental Law for Local Law Enforcement Officers Course reached an audience of 2,000. 5-2</p><p><b><b>FY 1993Enforcernent Accomplishments Reporf</b></b></p><p>NETI developed and implemented a Clearinghouse in FY 1993 for keeping constituent groups informed about NETI-sponsored training. The user-friendly NETI Clearinghouse is accessible nationally through a non-toll telephone number: 1-800 EPA-NETI. It is a major means for disseminating information about the availability of environmental enforcement training. In particular, State, local, and tribal environmental enforcers, who may not have ready access to computer networks, are only a telephone call away from up-to-the-minute information about NETI. Finally, NETI took major steps during the year to design and complete the new NETI Headquarters Training Center, which is scheduled for its official opening during the summer of 1994. The Center will be a model state-of-the-art training facility located in midtown Washington, D.C.

This action is intended to satisfy the statutory requirement found in 5 114(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act that the Administrator promulgate rules to provide guidance and to implement enhanced monitoring and compliance certifications for major stationary sources. The EPA intends to require each source subject to Part 64 to submit an annual compliance certification and monitoring reports each quarter detailing any deviations from applicable requirements in the source's permit. The EM program requires continuous compliance with underlying regulations and establishes a direct link between monitoring data and enforceability. Citizen Not ice Rule (40 CFR Part 541 - The Citizen Suit Notice Rule, proposed on February 10. 1993, sets forth the manner in which notice of citizen suits is to be provided as required by § 304 of the 1990 CAAA.

The purpose of the regulations is to reduce evaporative hydrocarbon emissions which contribute to ozone pollution levels. During the 1992 volatility control season, the volatility standards were made more stringent. Two hundred forty-one NOVs were issued for violations detected that season. As a result of these NOVs, subsequent settlement activities and a strong enforcement presence in the field during the 1993 control period, FOSD saw a significant reduction in volatility violations in FY 1993. Despite inspecting approximately the same number of parties in FY 1993 as in FY 1992, as of November 9, 1993, only 17 NOVs had beenissued for volatility violations detected during the 1993 volatility control season, and approximately 50 more NOVs were expected to be issued.

Media Suecific Enforcement Performance<br/>Superfund Enforcement<br/>FY 1993 was a respectable year for the Superfund Enforcement Program. The program reached a total of 200 settlements (NPL &amp; Non-NPL) with estimated values greater than $950 million with potential responsible parties (PRPs). Of this total amount, approximately $810 million was for 5 106 or 5 106/107 remedial design/action (RD/RA) settlements. The estimated RD/RA settlement values were broken down into three categories. The first category was composed of 36 5106 or 5 106/107 consent decrees for RD/RA referred by the Agency to the Department of Justice (DOJ), for PRP remedial work estimated at $366.3 million. The second category was made up of 42 unilateral administrative orders (UAOs) issued under 5 106(a) authority, and for which PRPs notified the Agency of their intent to comply. The estimated value of RD/RA work to be performed under these UAOs was put at $420.6 million. The final category of remedial settlement consisted of eight administrative orders on consent (AOCs) for remedial design only, reached through the SACM initiative. The estimated value of.design work under these AOCs was estimated to value over $24 million. In FY 1993 the Age&amp; issued a total of 126 unilateral administrative orders (UAOs), versus 107 in FY 1992, and 108 A W s (versus 128 in FY 1992) were signed with PRPs. Of a total of 126 UAOs issued, 50 were for RD/RA (42 in compliance), with the balance for other response work at NPL and Non-NPL sites. Under 5 107 and 5 106/107 settlements, the Agency referred 41 cases (36 referrals in FY 1992) to DOJ seeking and achieving $155 million for past costs incurred by the program (compared to $137.4 million referred in FY 1992). Since the inception of the Superfund Program in 1980, PRPs have committed to response actions estimated at over $8 billion, and the program has achieved settlements for over $1 billion in past costs. The percentages of PRP lead at NPL sites in M 1993 for remedial design and remedial action responses were 65%for RD and 79% for RA respectively (Federal Facilities excluded). In Pi 1992, the percentage of PRP leads at NPL sites was 73%for remedial designs, and 72% for remedial actions.</p><p><b>w</b><br/>0</p><p><b><b>Superfund Program Accomplishments (All Actions)</b><br/>200<br/>180</b></p><p><b>Total RIIFS</b></p><p><b>Total ROD</b></p><p><b>Total R D</b></p><p><b>Total RA</b></p><p><b>'</b><br/>C</p><p><b>160 140</b><br/>120</p><p><b>100</b><br/>80 60 40</p><p><b>i</b><br/>0</p><p><b>20 0</b></p><p><b>FY90 FY91 FY92 FY93 M 0 FY91 FY92 FY93 FY90 FY91 N 9 2 N 9 3 N 9 0 M91 N' 9 52<br/>PRP-Lead Response</b></p><p><b>N93</b></p><p><b><b>0 Fund-Lead Response</b></b></p><p><b><b>€PA Selected Remedy</b></b></p><p><b>6-1</b></p><p><b>@</b><br/>u.0</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>Clean Air Act Stationary Sources</b><br/>Significant Violators/Xmely and Appropriate Guidance The Significant Violators program is central to the air enforcement and compliance program because it establishes a structure to identify and correct the most important noncompliance situations.</p><p>FY 1993 was the first full year of implementation of the revised Significant Violators/nmely and Appropriate (SV/T&amp;A) Guidance, which revised the definition of a significant violator, thus expanding the universe of potential violators. Consequently, significant violator activity has greatly increased. By the end of FY 1993, there was a 150 percent increase in the number of significant violators identified over FY 1992; the number of significant violators that were addressed (Le., by issuing Civil Referral, Administrative Penalty Order, Consent Decree, etc.) increased by 80 percent; and the universe of significant violators at the end of FY 1993 doubled.

Specifically, MOD ensures that new motor vehicle manufacturers and importers comply with all Federal emission standards and requirements. MOD enforcement and compliance is conducted by the program office at headquarters. The Division conducts investigations, inspections, and testing of new and in-use motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines.</p><p><b>6-2</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Motor Vehicle Emissions Recalls MODs recall testing program continued to implement Federal emission requirements efficiently and effectively in FY 1993. Since the beginning of the recall program, a total of 46 million vehicles have been recalled. Thirty-four million of those vehicles were recalled as a direct result of El’A investigations. In N 1993, the motor vehicle emission recall program continued to play an important role in MODs efforts. During FY 1993, MOD investigations resulted in eight influenced recalls involving three manufacturers and a total of 370,OO recalled vehicles. In addition, 94,000 vehicles were recalled voluntarily by manufacturers without specific El’A action. In addition, MOD continued motor vehicle testing in a high altitude area (Denver, Colorado). This high altitude program conducted in coordination with the Colorado Department of Health (CDH), was initiated to ensure vehicles operated in high altitude areas comply with Federal emission standards. Under MODs direction, CDH tested seven engine families representing over one million vehicles. MOD expects this testing to result in two influenced recalls. One of these recalls involves 1989 4.0 liter Jeeps which are part of a larger investigation involving defective Chrysler oxygen sensors. This investigation will result in more than 700,000 and being recalled. Selective Enforcement Auditing\Banking and Trading Emission Credits MODs Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program continued to be a successful and highly leveraged program. The program consists of production-line emission testing of new lightduty motor vehicles and heavy-duty motor vehicle engines. The less than 170 individual tests ordered by MOD induced over 22,ooO additional voluntary emission tests conducted by manufacturers. MOD routinely audits the program that allows manufacturers to average, bank and trade (A,B&amp;T) particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen emission credits for heavy-duty engines. The program authorizes manufacturers who reduce emissions below regulatory requirements for a particular engine to raise emissions from another engine in the current model year or offset these reductions against emissions in a later model year or to trade credits for these reductions to other manufacturers of similar engines. In FY 1993, MOD audited four manufacturers representing approximately fifty percent of manufacturers using the A,B&amp;T program. Pursuant to these audits, MOD met with manufacturer representatives to clarify certain program requirements and reviewed A,B&amp;T records. MOD also initiated a rulemaking to clarify certain accounting requirements in the A,B&amp;T program. MODs heavy-duty SEA audits focused on engines that manufacturers selected to participate in the A,B&amp;T program. SEA audits targeted engines which had family emission limits (FELs) either below the Federal standards or close to the engines certification level. In FY 1993, SEA conducted ten heavy-duty engine audits and seven light-duty engine audits. As a result of an SEA, one manufacturer raised its FEL for an engine family to avoid an audit failure. Another manufacturer suspended production for one engine family rather than submit to an audit. Manufacturers Investigations In addition to the recall and SEA efforts, MOD continued to ensure that motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine manufacturers are in compliance with mtle I1 of the Clean Air Act. MOD investigations focused on manufacturers that introduced vehicles into commerce without obtaining an EPA certificate 6-3</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenr AccomplishmenfsRepoir</b></b></p><p>of conformity demonstrating compliance with Federal emission requirements. FY 1993 efforts yielded several full-scale investigations resulting. in substantial settlement payments to EPA. In addition to these enforcement actions, MOD is continuing eight manufacturer investigations. Nonconformance Penalties MOD also enforces the nonconformance penalty (NCP) program. Pursuant to^§ 206(g) of the Act, the NCP program was established to facilitate the implementation of technology-forcing emission standards. Specifically, NCPs allow a manufacturer of engines or vehicles that do not meet applicable emission standards, but are below a designated upper limit, to be issued a certificate of conformity upon payment of a monetary penalty. In F 1993,General Motors paid a NCP for one engine fa&amp;ly totaling Y $3,123.</p><p><b>Imports Program</b><br/>In FY 1993,MOD continued its implementation and enforcement of the Imports program under Xtle I1 of the Clean Air Act. This program, permits independent commercial importers (ICIs) that possess an appropriate certificate of conformity from EPA to import vehicles that do not comply with Federal emission standards and requirements (nonconforming motor vehicles). The program also permits designated Canadian importers (DCIs) to import Canadian motor vehicles determined by EPA to be identical in all material respects to certified U.S. version vehicles. The IC1 or DCI is solely responsible for meeting all Federal emission standards and requirements for all nonconforming motor vehicles it imports.</p><p>To determine compliance with the Imports program in FY 1993,MOD conducted in-office document audits of all operating ICIs and all shipping company CCPs. In addition, MOD conducted two on-site IC1 inspections, one on-site DCI inspection, and one port-of-call inspection. Pursuant to these audits, MOD discovered numerous imports regulation violations. In addition, to pursuing enforcement actions for these violations, MOD is continuing to investigate two other cases involving imports regulations violations.<br/>MOD also continued to approve and monitor catalyst control programs (CCl’). These programs are managed by other federal agencies, manufacturers, and shipping companies, to ensure the presence and proper functioning of emission control equipment on US. version vehicles driven overseas that are being .. returned to the U S . Field Operations and Support Division The Field Operations and Support Division (“FOSD) in the Office of Mobile Sources (“OMS”) enforces provisions of the Clean Air Act relating to the composition and use of motor vehicle fuels and tampering with vehicle emission control devices. FOSD also develops enforcement policy for OMS in these areas. FOSDs enforcement program includes: field investigations, augmented by state and local efforts and by contractor inspections; issuance of Notices of Violations (“NOVs”); negotiation of settlements; preparation for trials, either by referral to the United States Department of Justice or by the filing of an administrative complaint; and litigation if necessary. This enforcement program has been extremely successful in achieving environmental compliance over the years. FOSDs aggressive enforcement program led to major enforcement achievements during FY 1993. Included among these achievements was a significant reduction in volatility violations in<br/>6-4</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>.-</b></p><p>FY 1993 as compared to FY 1992, and a continued increase incompliance with EPAs policy on installation of aftermarket catalytic converters. FOSD also worked hard to prepare for the implementation and enforcement of the new diesel sulfur regulation which became effective on October 1, 1993, and continued working on development of enforcement provisions for the reformulated gasoline/anti-dumping regulations and detergent regulation.<br/>In F 1993, FOSD and its contractors conducted a total of 12,2378 inspections of vehicle Y repair shops, vehicle fleet owners, auto parts stores and parties in the fuel distribution system. As a result of these inspections and information gathered fromother sources, FOSD issued 311 NOVs representing proposed penalties of $4,297,560. The largest number of NOVs were issued for fuel violations with 221 NOVs issued and total proposed penalties of $3,666,010. Of these, 210 NOVs were issued for violations of EPAs volatility regulations with total proposed penalties of $2,313,010, two were issued for violation of the Clean Air Act's substantially similar requirement with total proposed penalties of $1,308,000, and nine were issued for other fuel violations with total proposed penalties of $45,000. A total of 90 NOVs were issued for violations of the Clean Air Act's tampering prohibition with penalties totaling $631,550. Of these, 51 NOVs were issued for violations of FOSDs aftermarket catalytic converter policy with total proposed penalties of $287,2350 and 39 NOVs were issued for other forms of tamperingwith total proposed penalties of $343,700. FOSD settled 220 cases in FY 1993 with cash civil penalties totaling $2,257,585. Additional payments totaling $93,000 went to alternative payment projects. The largest civil penalty was generated from the settlement of one outstanding lead phasedown case with a penalty of $571,000. In addition, consent decrees were entered in five FOSD cases during FY 1993 with penalties totaling $831,596. During FY 1993, there was a significant decrease in violations with respect to the installation of aftermarket catalytic converters, as compared to FY 1992. In FY 1992, EPAissued 73 NOVs for violations of FOSDs aftermarket catalytic converter enforcement policy (&quot;AMCC Policy&quot;). In FY 1993, only51 NOVs were issued for violations of the AMCC Policy. FOSD attributes this increase in compliance to its aggressive enforcement program, which includes investigation of repair shops to determine compliance, the review of aftermarket catalytic converter warranty cards, the issuance of NOVs, and education of both the public and the regulated community. EPA tampering survey data from past years indicates that theneed for catalytic converter replacement is as high as 4% of thenational fleet. Because of this substantial need for catalytic converters, the demand for new aftermarket catalytic converters has steadily increased in recent years.</p><p><b>Clean Water Act Enforcement NPDES</b><br/>Xmely and Appropriate Enforcement and the NPDES Exceptions Report The NPDES enforcement program has defined Significant Noncompliance (SNC to include violations of effluent limits, reporting requirements, and/or violations of formal enforcement actions. The NPDES program does not track SNC against a &quot;fixed base&quot; of SNC that is established at the beginning of the year, rather, the program tracks SNCs on a quarterly basis.

During FY 1993 287 facilities were reported on the SNC exceptions list including 40 facilities that were unaddressed from the previous year and 247 facilities that appeared on the list for the first time during the year. Of the 287 facilities on the exceptions list, 144 returned to compliance by the end of the year, 87 were subject to formal enforcement action, and 56 facilities remained to be addressed during the upcoming year. The number of facilities unaddressed in FY 1993 increased by 10. However, the number of facilities appearing as SNC decreased by 16% (2,362to 1 9 8 . This resulted in a decrease in T&amp;A from ,7) 90%in FY 1992 to 87% in FY 1993. During FY 1993, the regional offices filed 256 administrative penalty orders (APOs). Moreover, 178 final settlements of APOs were filed in FY 1993.</p><p><b>Toxic Substances Control Act Enforcement (TSCA)</b><br/>Over 125 companies have registered for the TSCA 58(e) Compliance Audit Program, which offers participating companies the opportunity to voluntarily submit late heath and safety reports from chemicals. Stipulated penalties averaging $5,000 per late report will be collected. The stipulated penalties are much less that the statutory maximums that could have been imposed. This program has been well received by the regulated community an has raised the profile of this important data reporting requirement. The CAP has generated a large volume of useful health and safety data. To date, more than 1O.OOO late reports have been received by the Agency.</p><p><b>B. Regional Office Accomplishments</b><br/>Region I Boston (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont)<br/>During FY 1993, Region I maintained an active enforcement program and continued to refine its management of the enforcement process. In the past year, the Region built on its previous efforts to incorporate a multi-media focus into the enforcement program, advanced an important dialogue with New England state enforcement officials to better coordinate enforcement efforts, and heightened its attention to resolving cases promptly and through innovative mechanisms. Region I's Enforcement Workgroup, which includes representatives of all the Region's media enforcement programs and the Office of Regional Counsel, continued to play a lead role in developing and overseeing multi-media enforcement. As in recent years, the Workgroup held a roundtable discussion early in the year at which each of the programs discussed their inspection and enforcement plans for the year. During this discussion, opportunities for coordinated and consolidated inspections were identified and the possibilities for participation in the various regional and national initiatives were surfaced. The workgroup also took up numerous other important multi-media issues including refinement of the Region's multi-media inspection checklist, data collection efforts and inspection and enforcement targeting. The clearest example of the Region's commitment to a multi-media approach is in the federal facilities area. In FY 1993, Region I conducted six multi-media inspections at federal facilities in connection with the February, 1993 national Federal Facilities Multi-media Enforcement/Compliance Initiative and in furtherance of the Region's federal facilities multi-media inspection program, begun in 1990. The inspections were conducted by EPA and state inspectors, and resulted in several notices of</p><p><b>66 -</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>noncompliance (federal or state) and one RCRA administrative enforcement penalty action under the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992. Since 1990, the Region has conducted fifteen federal facility multi-media inspections.<br/>Also to advance a multi-media approach (and with the endorsement of the Region’s leadership and the Enforcement Workgroup), training was conducted in the spring of 1993 for all of the Region‘s field inspectors on a number of important topics. All inspectors attended a course devoted exclusively to the subject of multi-media inspections at which experts from each of the enforcement programs discussed the major requirements of their programs so that inspectors would be better able to identify problems in areas beyond their individual programs. A separate course was held for all the inspectors which discussed ways in which they could promote pollution prevention during their inspections. Finally, a course was held for inspectors and others in the Region which covered the litigation process and was intended to help them understand how the process works and how they would fit in it.</p><p>FY 1993 was the first full year of operation of the New England State/EPA Environmental Enforcement Committee. This committee, which was organized and sponsored by Region I, includes high level representatives from the enforcement offices of all the state environmental agencies and from the environmental divisions of the state attorneys general offices in Region 1. The Committee meets approximately once every four months and addresses topics of mutual interest such as the coordination of enforcement efforts, participation in national initiatives, administrative penalty programs and mining needs.<br/>The Region also worked on a number of fronts to ensure the prompt and successful resolution of its enforcement cases and to explore the use of innovative settlement tools. A particular emphasis was placed on the resolution of the older judicial and administrative cases in the Region. Guidance was developed setting out various tools which could be used by regional staff to move negotiations to a prompt and successful outcomeor, alternatively, to put them on a track towards litigation. During FY 1993, Region I also worked on several fronts to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to settle cases and to enhance community involvement in controversial environmental decisions. These efforts have taken the form of educating regional management and staff about ADR techniques and their possible applications; educating the private bar about EPAs receptivity to ADR; representing EPA on an American Arbitration Association task force on environmental mediation; actively participating in a national workgroup on ADR to share information and ideas with other regions; and continuing to nominate cases for ADR in a broadening range of circumstances. The success of these efforts has been evident in increased general inquiries by both EPA case lawyers and members of the private bar about the appropriateness of mediating specific cases, as well as by the success of the region’sconvening efforts in 4 complex superfund cases (Savage Well, Nyanza, Iron Horse Park and Pine Street), each with a distinct set of challenges. Building on this experience, the Region is currently working with local, state, and congressional representatives to set up a process, with the assistance of a neutral facilitator, to address community concerns about the New Bedford Harbor superfund remedy.</p><p>Region I1 New York (New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands)<br/>Region I1 enjoyed a very strong year in virtually all categories of traditional measurement. For example, the Region’s regulatory (non-Superfund)enforcement programs generated over $8.5 million in penalties, their second highest annual total. This figure included almost $1.6 million in stipulated penalty collections for violations of earlier judicial consent decrees, a demonstration of the Region’s long-standing commitment to insuring compliance with settlement instruments.</p><p><b>6-7</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993Enforcement AccomplishmentsReport</b></b></p><p>Region II's Superfund enforcement program was again very successful, with enforcement case resolutions yielding nearly $340 million in value of work to be performed, cost recovery agreements, and penalties assessed. This is the Region's second highest year in terms of both the value of work secured from responsible parties ($253.8 million) and penalties assessed ($1.7 million); the $83.3 million in past costs which were recovered is three times higher than Region's best previous year. In the non-CERCLA arena, judicial penalty assessments resulting from settled and adjudicated cases totaled over $5.2 million in FY 1993, the Region's second highest ever. Penalties proposed in FY 1993 administrative complaints totaled $11.1 million; proposed administrative penalties in four separate programs exceeded $1 million (EPCRA, RCRA, TSCA and CWA). Administrative penalty assessments (in settlements and adjudicated decisions) totaled nearly $3.2 million. Total judicial and administrative penalty assessments were thus about $8.6 million. The value of injunctive relief secured through Region I1 non-CERCLA judicial settlements entered in FY 1993 exceeded $12 million. Supplemental Enforcement Projects (SEW were included in more than ten settlements, under the EPCRA, TSCA, RCRA and CWA programs. The total dollar value of these SEPs was about $1 million. In FY 1993, Region II had one of its highest annual outputs in the number of referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice for litigation activities. The Region generated some 60 such civil referrals, including consent decree enforcement refemals, collection actions, bankruptcy referrals, and pre-referral negotiation (PRN)packages. Of these, 29 were in the Superfund arena. During F 1993, Region I1 continued to closely monitor the status of compliance among judicial Y defendants and administrative Respondents with the terms of settlements and orders. Of the 60 referrals initiated, six were consent decree enforcement referrals and seven were collection actions for non-payment of penalties. This output demonstrates the importance that Region I1 assigns to ensuring compliance by former violators; the Region is persuaded that follow-through of this sort is essential to the overall success of an enforcement program. Region I1 continued its aggressive implementation of the Administrator's goals for multi-media enforcement. Under the auspices of our Regional Multi-Program Enforcement Steering Committee, major, consolidated inspections including nearly every Regional program office were carried out at 13 facilities, including three federal facilities. A number of these yielded evidence of violations in one or more program areas -- although the Region states that fewer very serious violations were detected than in past years. In addition, Region I1 has carried out a large number of other consolidated and coordinated multimedia inspections involving a smaller number of Regional program offices (usually two or three). In fact, based on the Agency's data, through the third quarter of FY 1993 Region I1 accounted for 39% of the nation's consolidated multi-media inspections; over 20% of its coordinated multi-media inspections; and nearly 88%of single media inspections performed utilizing the multi-media checklist. In addition to major multi-media enforcement inspections, and the enforcement activities arising from them, the Region has actively pursued a number of other multi-media initiatives, including several Regional geographic enforcement initiatives. The Region also pursued geographic initiatives in the Cortland and Coming Aquifer regions of New York as well as the Niagara Frontier region of New York.</p><p><b>6-8</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenl Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>Region I11 - Philadelphia</b><br/>(Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia)<br/>FY 1993 was a milestone year for enforcement in Region 111. Region 111 had a recordbreaking enforcement year as measured by enforcement activity numbers with 54 civil referrals, 16 criminal referrals, 11 PRNs, 237 administrative orders, and 102 administrative complaints. This represents a 35%, 6.6%, and 12% growth over last year's numbers in civil referrals, criminal referrals, and administrative complaints, respectively. The criminal enforcement program set a new record in FY 1993 for Region 111. Furthermore, F 1993 established a record for the number of civil referrals, when one Y excludes FY 1978. (The civil referral numbers for M 1978 were artificially high because a number of civil referrals were fragmented into their parts and referred separately). Programs that witnessed impressive growth in the number of civil referrals over last year's numbers were NPDES and CAA/Asbestos, which had over a 300% and 500% rate-of-growth, respectively.</p><p>In addition to these record breaking numbers, Region I11 also embarked on several significant Special Enforcement Initiatives to focus on specific sites, geographic areas, pollutants, or industrial sectors with noteworthy environmental or compliance problems. The goal of these initiatives are to gain maximum deterrence through publicity and facility-spccific impact. Continuing its leadership role, Region Ill actively developed and pursued regional and national enforcement initiatives in FY 1993.<br/>In FY 1993, Region 111 embarked on a strategic planning exercise. As a necessary prerequisite for this project, the Region conducted a detailed study of Region 111 environmental data. The study's findings were an important resource in the establishment of the Region's Strategic planning goals. The goals are Regional Management, Reliance on Data, State Relations, Acid Pollution, and Ozone. They were targeted because they: require special Region-wide focus to succeed; take advantage of unique Region I11 leadership opportunities; have a high potential for risk reduction, and provide a forum for creative leadership. The goals do not define all of the Region's important work. Instead, they are areas where the Region feels that it can focus some of its efforts and make important improvements in addition to pursuing national priorities. Currently, the Region is actively engaged in devising enforcement strategies and objectives to accomplish these goals and to establish measures to measure their success. Headquarters and Region III have placed increasing importance on the role enforcement should play in attaining non-traditional enforcement goals, such as protection of human health, preservation and restoration of ecosystems, and ensuring a high quality of public welfare. These are goals that are neither media nor program-specific, and to achieve them requires that they be addressed in a holistic m e r . Multi-media enforcement permits addressing the environmental status of a facility in an integrated fashion which recognizes the interconnected relationship between the media and facility processes have the potential to be an important tool in this effort. Region 111 has recognized this and has placed increased importance on the use of multi-media enforcement as an instrument to achieve its goals. Over the past three years, the Region has engaged in numerous multi-media enforcement initiatives arising from both the Headquarters' level and the Regional level. While there were some successes, there was the perception in this Region that multi-media enforcement had not yet lived up to its potential. In trying to maximize its effectiveness, the Region's Senior Managers formed a Quality Action Team with representatives from the various enforcement programs and offices. After almost a year of work by the Enforcement Branch Chiefs, the Region finished developmcnt and started implementation of a fully integrated casc-screening and multi-media enforcement process in FY 1993. 6-9</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenf AccomplishmenfsReporf</b></b></p><p>In F 1993, Region 111 and its States have made significant efforts to strengthen their enforcement Y partnership. This year marked the beginning of an effort between Region 111 and its States to strengthen the FederaVState enforcement relationship. On August 10,1993, representatives from both the Region I11 and the State/Local enforcement programs met in Region III's Philadelphia office to discuss enforcement planning for Fiscal Year 1994. While it is common for each of the Regions' enforcement programs to meet with their State counterparts to discuss their specific program goals, this meeting marked. the first Region In meeting with its States dedicated to cross-program.enforcement issues. This meeting was viewed as a success by all the participants and has lead to the initiation of biannually State/EPA Enforcement Meetings to build upon the State/EPA partnership.</p><p>Region IV Atlanta (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee)<br/>Region IV continued to emphasize multi-media enforcement during FY 1993 through two highlevel management teams known as the Enforcement Decision Team (EDT) and the Multi-media Enforcement Team (MET), and using the expertise of the Enforcement Planning and Analysis Staff (El' &amp; A). The EDT is chaired by the Assistant Regional Administrator and comprised of Associate and Deputy Division Directors, the Policy, Planning and Evaluation Branch Chief, and the MET chairperson. The EDT reports directly' to the Deputy Regional Administrator to assist him in setting multi-media policies and priorities. The MET is chaired by a member of the EDT. and comprised pri'marily of Section Chiefs, one from each division, and the Enforcement Planning and Analysis Staff Chief. The MET reports directly to the EDT and provides support to the EDT by managing and conducting multi-media inspections and enforcement activities. In FY 1993 Region IV conducted 34 mu1ti:media consolidated inspections and initiated three multi-media enforcement cases, including one civil referral. A multi-media enforcement initiative in Chattanooga has resulted in a clean-up program under Superfund for Chattanooga Creek.<br/>The El' &amp; A staff supports the RA/DRA's role as principal manager for Region IV's enforcement programs. The EP &amp; A staff also supports the EDT and is an active participant in the MET. Activities include developing policies and agreements, analyzing data to target activities and evaluate results, providing agenda/work products, coordinating and developing multi-media enforcement activities, serving as primary multi-media contact with Headquarters and states, and serving as regional spokesperson at national meetings and conferences on enforcement.</p><p>Region IV became the first region to initiate multi-year enforcement agreements with its eight states to reduce the time and effort expended in negotiating yearly enforcement agreements. The multimedia agreements cover the period from October 1,1993 through September 30,1996, and document general enforcement policies, issues and directions regarding enforcement roles, oversight, penalties, data, training, targeting efforts, enforcement initiatives, and communications. Each media will address specific items as necessary through MOAS and grant workplans that will continue to be developed on a yearly basis by each program. Region IV continued its strong commitment to multi-media activities at federally-owned sites through its Federal Facilities Coordination (FFC) program. The FFC program conducted two OFFE federal facilities multi-media compliance inspections at Air Force Plant #6 and Redstone Arsenal, ten regional federal facilities multi-media inspections, and five Indian tribal multi-media compliance inspections. The FFC program also held a Regional Multi-media Federal Facilities Environmental Compliance Conferencethat was attended by over 300 persons.</p><p><b>6-10</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenl AccomplishmenrsRepon</b></b></p><p>All Region IV divisions participated in the successful first year of the Tampa Bay Enforcement 1 Initiative, which resulted in 103 inspections, 1 permit reviews, five 5 308 letters, 19 NOVs, three AOs, and one civil referral. Region IV approved twenty-six Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEI'S) in FY 1993. The projected costs range from $10,000 to $4,000,000 with the total projected costs exceeding $14.4 million. Thirteen of the SEPs are classified as pollution prevention projects and account for $6.2 million of the total projected costs. Region W s RCRA program continued to produce high enforcement outputs by issuing 15 new complaints and settling 25 administrative cases, with penalties in final administrative orders increasing from $900,Mx) in FY 1992 to $2,446,000 in FY 1993. Emphasis was placed on settling older cases. Final Consent Decrees were entered for Sanders Lead with a penalty of $2 million and for &amp;mlman with a penalty of $2.5 million which included a $1 million pollution prevention project. Region IV referred two new judicial cases to Headquarters in FY 1993. In FY 1993, Region IV accounted for approximately 20 per cent of all Superfund removal starts nationally, including a solid 25 per cent of all EPA funded clean-ups. Region IV obligated nearly $24 million in clean-up monies to contractors. Major projects completed in FY 1993 included ILCO, AquaTech, Basket Creek, Cherokee Oil, and Escambia Wood (Pensacola). Enforcement actions under the NPDES program indudcd eight civil referrals, 54 Administrative Penalty Orders (APOs) and 117 Administrative Orders (AOs), all of which exceeded F 1992 totals. Y For F 1993 six judicial consent decrees were signed with cash penalties totaling $4.4 million. The Y largest one of these, CSXT, contained $3.0 million in cash penalties and $4.1 million in Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs). NPDES settled 30 APOs for a total of $569,000, with an additional $5.6 million in SEPs being agreed to in APO settlements. Region IV became the first region to take an &quot;DES civil judicial action under the emergency powers authority granted in 5 504 of the Clean Water Act with its action against Dade County, Florida. Region Iv's UIC program met or exceeded all their workplan goals for FY 1993. The program completed nine AOs and referred two civil and three criminal cases to DOJ. Region IV continued to lead the nation in UIC enforcement activity throughout F 1993. Y Region IVs UST program participated in many of Region IV's multi-media activities for FY 1993, one of which was the first civil referral case in the nation taken against a company for UST release detection violations. In N 1993 Region IV also took its first administrative action against a hazardous substance tank owner for failure to comply with UST release detection requirements. Under the Clean Air Act, Region IV filed 14 AFOs with total penalty amounts of $658,790 under Section 113(d), which represents a 400% increase in use of this enforcement tool over the initial year of availability, FY 1992, and an increase of 289% in the amount of penalties sought. Three civil referrals were issued in FY 1993 with penalties totaling $2,492,840. In conjunction with ORC and Headquarters, Region IV settled 12 outstanding cases for $4,799,000, including the following: Crown Cork and Seal, $343,000; Louisiana Pacific, Clayton, Alabama and Commerce, Georgia; and Olin Corporation, $1,000,000. Region IV issued the first immediate compliance A 0 under 5 113(d)(3) to require the removal of asbestos containing material (ACM). This precedent setting order was issued at the uncontrolled release of ACM at Louisville Forge and Gear.</p><p><b>6-11</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>Region V Chicago (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin)</b><br/>In FY 1993, Region V achieved a record number (98) and record national share of judicial consent decrees and orders after trial. This compares to 54 judicial consent decrees and orders for FY 1992. Highlighting the Region's success was a precedential,' multi-media consent decree with Inland Steel, which included a $55 million package ($26.5 million for supplemental environmental 'projects, $25 .Gllion in injunctive relief, and $3.5 million in civil penalties). Other highlights include a $6 million penalty judgment after trial against Bethlehem Steel, located in Bums Harbor, Indiana, and the entry of a CWA 5309 Order requiring Wayne County, Michigan, to implement plans for a sewer collection system a cost of over $180 million dollars. Last year, The Geographic Initiative process reached a certain level of maturity. The Region currently is operating five initiative areas: Gateway (East St. Louis, IL), Tri-State (Ironton, OH area), 'SEMI (Detroit, MI, area), Northwest Indiana, and Southeast Chicago. During the year, the Northwest Indiana/Southeast Chicago Gcographic Initiative area.was split into two separately functioning units along the state line. The reason for this division was to make each of the initiatives more manageable since the work being done in the area had grown quite substantially in the years since the creation of the original Region V geographic enforcement initiative area. Another positive development of the geographic initiatives was the expansion of interaction with state and local governments and local community groups. For example, toward the end of the year the Region and the State of Indiana took steps to move from periodic meetings held to describe actions that have been taken, to much more frequent, specific and detailed meetings to jointly plan, conduct and coordinate enforcement actions according to a comprehensive enforcement action plan. Another example is the creation of the position of Enforcement Ombudsman to work with local community groups in the Southeast Chicago area. .. During M 1993, multi-media enforcement became less of an experiment and more of a standard and very useful tool in the Region V enforcement arsenal. The creation one year ago of the Multi-Media 'Branch in the Office of Regional Counsel has significantly helped the coordination of such enforcement strategies and actions. During the year, a number of important multi-media actions were concluded and others initiated. These specific cases, such as Inland Steel, are described in detail previously in this report. The 'cross divisional Multi-Media Litigation Screening Committee met on a monthly basis throughout the year and coordinated the development of the multi-media enforcement actions. In .addition, a list of 23 facilities in priority order were targeted for multi-media inspection during FY . 1994. All of these facilities are located in the five geographic initiative areas. It is most unlikely that resources will allow for all of these inspections to be conducted, but it is a good sign of the general acceptance of the value of the multi-media approach that this many actions would be selected. Region V's'wetlands program was very successful in FY 1993. The first criminal indictment for a wetland +iolation in Region V was handed down by,a grand jury in June 1993. In addition, through the permit process and Superfund coordination, thousands of acres of mitigation were proposed in an attempt to comply with the zero net loss of wetland objective. Region V continued to encourage innovative forms of relief in negotiating settlements. In M 1993, the Region used Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in settlement of 52 cases. The total value for fiscal year 1993 SEPs was nearly 15 times greater than the value of FY 1992 SEPs, reaching approximately $42 million dollars. Many of the SEPs focused on pollution prevention, responding to EPAs increasing concern with fighting pollution at its source.</p><p><b>6-12</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Region V participated in all of the National Enforcement Initiatives organized by the Office of Compliance Monitoring in OPPTS. In two of the three TSCA enforcement initiatives, and in the EPCRA Section 5313 enforcement initiative;Region V lead all other EPA regions in the number of complaints issued and in the total proposed penalties. During FY 1993, the Region continued high levels of activity in the Boiler Industrial Furnace (BIF) Initiative. EPA conducted inspections at over twenty BIF facilities which had become subject to the new hazardous waste combustion regulations promulgated in August of 1991. The Region's efforts culminated in ten administrative enforcement actions being filed as part of EPAs highly successful Combustion Initiative.. Total penalties sought in these actions amounted to over $8 million. The RCRA Illegal Operators Initiative got underway this year. This Initiative is a cooperative effort between EPA Headquarters, EPA Regional Offices and State Environmental Agencies. As part of this effort, States focused their inspection activities towards identifying entities engaged in the illegal storage or disposal of hazardous wastes. Judicial, administrative and criminal enforcement cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary penalties were filed to address the violations detected as part of these inspections. Most of the cases, filed as part of the Initiative in June and July of 1993, are in preliminary stages of litigation or negotiation. Finally, Region V s criminal enforcement program had a record year. The number of referrals (28), indictments (15) and defendants charged (24) exceeded any previous year's totals.</p><p><b>Region VI = Dla als (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas)</b></p><p>Region VI maintained an active enforcement program in FY 1993. The RCRA program had an exceptional year in 1993 by commencing 33 new enforcement actions with total proposed penalties of over $12 million. Final orders were issued for 12 cases. In addition, four enforcement corrective action orders were finalized and two imminent and substantial endangerment orders were issued, including the first 'such order nationwide to a federal facility. The Region also commenced two of the first administrative penalty cases against federal facilities under the authority given in the Federal Facility Compliance Act. Regional RCRA enforcement initiatives included commencing eight enforcement actions against boilers and industrial furnaces, four enforcement actions against facilities in the area of the U.S./Mexico Border, and two enforcement actions against foundries. Another Region VI RCRA enforcement initiative involved the improper handling of shipments of hazardous waste into the United States. A binational Hazardous Waste Tkacking System (HWTS) has been developed by EPA RegionVI and the Mexican government to verify compliance with U.S. and Mexican laws of transboundary shipments of hazardous waste. The HWTS is capable of merging and comparing Mexican hazardous waste shipment data with U.S. manifests to confirm movement of hazardous waste from maquiladoras in Mexico to treatment, storage and disposal ( E D ) facilities or recycling facilities in the United States. The system tracks volumes of wastes, waste types, foreign generator, and ultimate disposition of the waste. Discrepancy reports generated by the HWTS identified US. import violations which resulted in three Administrative Complaints. This initiative has received considerable positive national media coverage ( e g . Wall Street Journal and Journal of</p><p><b>Commerce).</b><br/>During this fiscal year, the Region VI Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) was very active in assisting other Regions in developing and implementing the federal field citation program. OUST provided assistance to RegionVI in their federal field citation program by providing on-the-job 6-13</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>training for State UST inspectors in Arizona and California, and conducted classroom training for California UST State/County/Local regulators at the University of California. Because of OUSTS field initiative, all but two Regions have now begun to implement their own federal field citation program. The field citation program developed and implemented by Region VI OUST continues to be an effective and efficient enforcement tool. Joint EPA/State inspections, using field citations, were conducted in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. During F 1993,50 inspections were conducted and 38 field Y citations were issued. Total penalties collected were $17,850 (field citation penalties ranged from $50$1,500 per facility). The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) will be acting as EPAs oversight representative during the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) at the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (Albuquerque) Superfund Site. Over the past several years, NMED has been overseeing the Responsible Party’s activities at the site and has provided comments to the Responsible Party throughout the initial stages of the investigation. In order to reduce the possibility of duplication of efforts and, more importantly, to provide the state with an opportunity to build its Superfund capability, EPA has requested NMED act as EPA’s oversight representative during the Rl/FS and perform the human health and ecological risk assessments. NMED will be conducting the human health and ecological risk assessments in-house. On May 14, 1993, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to ARCO and El Pas0 Natural Gas (EPNG) for the performance of the remedial design and remedial action for the Prewitt Abandoned Refinery Superfund Site in New Mexico. As a result of unresolved differences between ARCO and EPNG, and in order for both parties to continue to be in compliance with the Administrative Order, both parties took it upon themselves to submit separate work plans for the performance of the remedial design (RD). Thus, EPA, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and the Navajo Nation Superfund Program (NSP) have been conducting dual reviews of the RD work plans. As during the remedial investigation and feasibility study and the record of decision writing process, both NMED and NSP have provided technical support to EPA during the RD work plan review. Both NMED and NSP have cooperated with EPA in providing comments on all of the revisions and have been willing to participate in conferencecalls and meetings when their assistance was needed.</p><p>The Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) enforcement program was very successful in FY 1993. The commencement of 81 administrative penalty actions represented approximately one-third of the national total, and the issuance of 735 administrative orders (non-penalty) represented over one-half of all such orders issued by EPA nationwide. The Region was also very successful in resolving judicial and administrative penalty cases, resulting in the payment of over $4.6 million in civil penalties.</p><p>The NPDES program was also successful in maintaining the integrity of the self-reporting program and in protecting water quality. Specifically, the Region participated in a national initiative to ensure accurate reporting and analysis, by initiating enforcement actions for failure to submit accurate discharge monitoring reports, for failure to properly collect and analyze wastewater samples, and for failure to re-apply for NPDES permits in a timely manner.<br/>To address water quality concerns, the Region laid the groundwork for future enforcement actions by identifying facilities with serious sanitary sewer overflows and bypasses. A number of enforcement actions were commenced to eliminate raw sewage overflows from sanitary sewers.</p><p><b>6-14</b></p><p><b>Region VI1 Kansas City (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska)</b><br/>Region VI1 emphasized its Multi-Media Enforcement Committee as the focus of its enforcement targeting and coordination efforts, for case selection for reducing risk and implementing enforcement initiatives and the Administrator's priorities. The Region targeted three multi-media inspection candidates using TRI data, compliance histories, and geographic location. All three have resulted in referrals for enforcement. Multi-media enforcement cases are most successfully developed from initial targeting for multi-media inspections in a small Region like Region VII. The Region's efforts and emphasis on state enforcement activities continued in FY 1993. However, the severe flooding in the Midwest resulted in lower numbers of state cases than in prior years. Nonetheless, Region VI1 states completed a number of cases and began utilizing press releases to announce the successful conclusion to case filings. The Office of Regional Counsel has done significant outreach to publicize the pollution prevention/supplemental environmental projects alternative to a portion of the assessed penalty. Region VI1 states are beginning to accept alternative environmental projects to offset a portion of the penalties. Region VI1 is committed to maintaining a strong federal/state enforcement program. Recognizing that most of the programs which can be delegated to the states have been in the region, they have invested time and resources in helping their states develop and utilize their enforcement capacity. The result of this effort has been an improved relationship between EPA and the states, and better leveraging of the increasingly scarce state and federal resources.</p><p>Region V 1 Denver I1 (Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming)<br/>In FY 1993, Region V 1 referred 23 cases to the Department of Justice and took 308 administrative I1 actions. Activities in FY 1993 were somewhat lower than FY 1992. FY 1993 numbers appear lower in comparison to FY 1992 because FY 1992 activities were higher than is the norm for most programs. Other reasons for the somewhat lower numbers were program specific. For example, in the FIFRA program the delayed revision of a required form caused the lowered numbers. The UST program decrease was due to states receiving increased authority. In other cases, programs with administrative authority equal to their civil authority chose to use the former. The Region VI11 Multi-Media Program continued to grow, gain momentum, and become institutionalized. This year, the Regional Enforcement Officer (REO) also acted as the Multi-media Enforcement Branch Chief of ESD and worked directly with the multi-media inspection teams. The Region participated in eight targeted multi-media inspections and focused on including states in the site selection and inspection process. Additionally, in FY 1993, the Region developed increased environmental justice capacity by including census data evaluation and the three &quot;lifestyle clusters&quot; suggested by the Office of Enforcement (OE) into both targeting and screening activities. In the early stages of its existence, the Enforcement Standing Committee (ESC) addressed both enforcement policy and management and facility or case-specific matters. As the Region began to institute the multi-media approach and the number of multi-media actions increased, the Region realized that a mechanism was needed to discuss and manage facility or case-specific issues. Thus the Regional Enforcement Forum (REF) was created to deal with facility and case-specific enforcement related activities (see above). The creation of the REF has left the E X as the Regional body responsible for discussing and addressing Regional enforcement policy.<br/>6-15</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenl AccowiplishmenlsReport</b></b></p><p>The Regional Enforcement Forum q e s as the primary mechanism for regularly needed crossprogram and qion-wide enforcement communications and coordination. The REF serves as a standing committee representing all enforcement programs and coordinates the review and implementation of regional, cross-program and multi-media inspection and enforcement activities including inspection coordination and review o selected enforcement actions. It is the REF that evaluates cases, forms f multi-media teams and develops initial strategies and direitions for these. 'It is the REF that works at the nuts-and-bolts level of multi-media case work. For example, the REF,det&amp;nineswhether or not an activity should be addressed regionally and, if so, what program division is the lead. The REF prioritizes targeted and untargeted multi-media inspections and ktablishes multi-media inspection teams. Another important function of the REF is to resolve case of inspection specific conflicts and, where appropriate, elevating all unresolved conflicts to the ESC. The REF also recommends decisions regarding inspectionsand enforcement policies 6r operations to the ESC.</p><p>During FY 1993, the Region improved its multi-media inspection targeting process by adding new factors to the &quot;base&quot; process. The base process included all facilities having RCRA IDS and reporting to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), all federal facilities permitted in at least two different media, and NEIC's CCRIP report-facilities listed are added to above list if not already .there. Throughout the process state and program input/feedback on lists (20 facilities per state). IDEA analysis on each site m r e s are determined for each site by considering compliance history, multi-media potential, status of facility on NPL, N 1993 National/Regional/State initiatives (e.g., Environmental Justice, &quot;DES I heapleach mining sites, RCRA non-notifiers, pulp &amp; paper facilities, ND tribal lands initiatives, etc.) for the coming year. Scores from above factors lead to list of top five facilities in each state; consensus is then reached between the Region and.each State to do two multi-media inspections in the next fiscal year in each state. Prior to the insdections, the objective of each multi-media inspection is discussed and agreed upon with each state.<br/>Originating the multi-media concept, the Sand Creek Pilot Project was designed to institutionalize the holistic approach to compliance and enforcement 'into environmental protection. Region VIII, the Colorado Department of Health, and the Tri-County Health Department participated jointly in the 'Pilot Project. Targeted inspections at two large facilities in the area resulted in coordinated multi-media State and EPA enforcement actions to address seepage into Sand Creek. Following compliance inspections, using data and information gathe&amp; during the Project, the three agencies hosted a series of pollution prevention workshops for companies in the area. These workshops, consisting of three different half-day pollution prevention workshops, were designed around the types of violations found in the area as well as the primary types of industry.<br/>' During FY 1993,Region VI11 has incorporated environmental equity activities into the following Regional processes: Building an Environmental Equity Database, Targeting Multi-Media Inspections, and Case Screening. Future environmental equity accomplishments include developing a user-friendly equity database that can be used by everyone with a connection to the LAN, so that equity factors can be used in everyone's daily work processes.</p><p>Region V I has had success in integrating pollution prevention into enforcement. Some of the II activities include: Nephi Rubber Products, Huish Detergent, Denver Metal Finishing Company, City of Rock Springs, the Trona Mine Initiative, and projects such as the Sand Creek Pilot Project and Wyoming Outreach. The unique aspect of the Nephi Rubber Products case is that a pollution prevention pilot project has been proposed and has been agreed upon by the facility, the EPA Regional office, and the State agency. Huish Detergent, Salt Lake City, Utah, which was required to put in a safety chlorine cleaning system which would clean any spills and set up an isolation system. Denver Metal Finishing Company, Denver, Colorado, which was installed a sand filter for use in their production pmess.</p><p><b>6-16</b></p><p><b>,_</b></p><p><b>.</b><br/>#“-a</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>v! k2</b><br/>*,,&amp;</p><p>,: Region VIII continues to be a leader in developing tribal capacity. For example, the FIFRA program supported efforts conducted/hosted two tiaining sessions: National Tribal Workshop and Advanced Inspector Training (states/tribes). Also two ‘tribal inspectors were also brought into the Regional Office for one-on-one training by regional staff. The Oglala Sioux (Pine Ridge) Tribal Enforcement Program submitted a draft Revised Pesticide C6de and Certification Plan to Region VI11 for approval. This Code and Plan are now being reviewed by Regional and Headquarters staff. Also the Cheyenne River Sioux Enforcement Program received approval for an Endangered Species Protection Program, the first ltibal Program in Region VI11 to .conduct endangered speaes protection activities. Additionally, during M 1993 the Region reviewed a program assumption proposal for the CWA 5 404 program submitted by the Confederated Salish and KFteriai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation in Montana.</p><p>The Region also continues to develop state capacity. For example, the Underground Injection Control (SDWA/UIC) program has an annual meeting between all the States, interested Tribes and EPA in which information/technicaI exchange occurs regarding better/different ways to implement the program. In M 1993 the Region provided grant funds for over $1 million in State program development efforts and related wetlands activities. To standardize the Region’s approach to the RCRA program oversight of State enforcement programs, EPA negotiated, created and will now implement the Appropriate State Oversight Program (ASOP) with its States.’ The ASOP effort emphasizes a base line &amp; differential (incremental) approach to oversight in order to focus on states where program enhancement is needed as well as disinvest where it is not. In the RCRA program, states are e,ncouraged to participate in RCRA enforcement cases as a partner. In some cases, EPA RCRA turns significant actions over to the States for capacity and partnership building experiences. For example, in the State of Utah, EPA allowed the State laboratory personnel conduct a RCRA Lab audit at Nephi Rubber for the purposes of identifying compliance concerns and pollution prevention opportunities.</p><p>Region IX San Francisco (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Trust Territories )<br/>Region Ix’s enforcement accomplishments during M 1993 were highlighted by multi-media compliance activities, implementation of a field citation program, continuing success with significant settlements and criminal prosecutions.</p><p>The Region’s multi-media compliance effort focused on Federal Facilities, areas of geographical significance and petroleum refineries. The majority of the Federal Facility activity was conducted in cooperation with the State of California. The geographical focus was provided by the San Francisco Bay Delta as a priority estuary as well as Santa Monica Bay. The refinery interest intersects the geographic focus and was performed in cooperation with state and local environmental agencies.<br/>The Underground Storage Tank field citation program was initiated in Region IX during N 1993. This approach enables inspectors to issue citations and gain signed consent agreement- final orders with an efficient expenditure of resources. The inducement to the facility is a lower penalty than might be the result if a formal CC/CAFO process was pursued subsequent to the inspection. These on-the-spot citations are issued for clear cut violations that are easily identified at the time of the inspection. Begun during the fourth quarter, results are positive. Of 28 inspections conducted, 24 citations with penalties were issued and 21 were settled before the quarter’s end. Penalties ranged from $50 to $800 with an average between$300 to $400. The citations have achieved expedited compliance from the regulated community, with efficient enforcement resource use.</p><p><b>6-1 7</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>I</b><br/>In Y.S. v. Mobil Oil C o r nration, (E.D. Cal) a consent decree was entered on February 4, 1993. Under the decree Mobil will pay a civil penalty of $950,000 for violations of the Clean Air Act. The complaint alleged that Mobil's polystyrene foam manufacturing facility emitted more isopentane, a volatile organic compound that is a precursor to ground level ozone pollution, than was permitted by the applicable State Implementation Plan. The fine is the second largest penalty levied by EPA for Clean Air Act violations in California. Region I continues to aggressively enforce pretreatment requirements. In US. v McDonnell X Douplas C a (C.D. Cal) a consent decree was entered on September 17,1993 in which the company agreed to pay $505,000 in settlement of the action brought to address violations at its aerospace manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach, California. The company discharged approximately 7,000 gallons of metal finishing waste from its printed circuit board manufacturing operations in violations of the pretreatment standards. The wastewater was discharged to the County Sanitation Districts of Orange County wastewater system.</p><p><b>Region X Seattle (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington)</b><br/>In FY 1993, Region X undertook a comprehensive look inward at the enforcement processes and outcomes currently associated with their enforcement/compliance activities. This activity is on-going and will help shape enforcement and compliance activities in the future. Continuing its effort to build an integrated multi-media enforcement program, in FY 1993 Region X emphasized the refinement of its riskdriven targeting process. A Targeting Workgroup was set up to create a systematic targeting procedure which will be used and improved upon, based on this year's success, in future years to ensure a list of multi-media inspection sites which meets the criteria that it be risk-based, consider regional and national enforcement initiatives, and incorporate program priorities and best professional judgment of state and EPA inspectors. Integrating information from several databases was a key element of the process. The Workgroup was aided by a facilitator in developing its targeting protocol. Consistent with improving its targeting procedures, Region X refined and emphasized its multimedia program by performing ten coordinated multi-media inspections in FY 1993. Setting new precedent in State/EPA cooperation and partnership opportunities, was the cross-media inspection at the FMC Corporation in Pocatello, Idaho. This inspection involved ten media programs, and was performed by inspectors from EPA Region X in Seattle and Operations Office in Boise, Idaho, EPA National Enforcement Investigation Center (NEIC), State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and inspectors from the Shoshone Bannock tribe. In addition, Region X was a full participant in the National Federal Facilities Multi-Media Enforcement Initiative, and performed multi-media inspections at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, and Ft. Richardson Army Base at Ft. Richardson, Alaska. In FY 1993, Region X continued its active program for innovative enforcement settlements, emphasizing Pollution Reduction, Pollution Prevention, Waste Minimization and Environmental Restoration Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs). In N 1993 Region X had a total of 20 SEPS, mostly in TSCA and EPCRA cases, and will continue to do more. Region Xs F 1993 SEPs also included Y five administrative Clean Air Act Cases that will result in a significant reduction of particulate emissions. Of particular note in Region X are the settlements in two judicial cases involving the Oil Pollution Act. These cases were settled for approximately 5970,000 and included the company's commitment to install and operate state of the art oil spill prevention and leak detection programs at an estimated cost of $1,600,000.</p><p><b>6-18</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p>Region X Water Division has pioneered the watershed approach in environmental protection. This approach is built on three main principles. First, target watersheds should be those where pollution poses the greatest risk to human health, ecological resources, desirable uses of the water, or a combination of these. Second, all parties with a stake in the specific local situation should participate in the analysis of problems and the creation of solutions. Third, the actions undertaken should draw on the full range of methods and tools available, integrating them into a coordinated, multiorganization attack on the problems. Using these criteria, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Compliance Program conducted inspections in priority watersheds, clustered enforcement actions, and offered technical assistance/outreach in priority areas. In March 1993, eight EPA and four state inspectors inspected 33 concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in the mid-Snake River area of south-central Idaho. These inspections were planned to occur during the snow-melt and rainfall period of early spring. From these inspections twelve administrative penalty complaints were issued in mid-June. These cases were part of a regional enforcement initiative in which dischargers to this water quality limited waterbody were targeted. Suspension and Debarment are administrative processes which exist for the protection of the Government in its business dealings. Even though Suspension and Debarment are not traditionally viewed as enforcement tools, they provide an important adjunct to EPAs regulatory programs by creating incentives for compliance with EPAs civil and criminal environmental laws. In FY 1993 the EPA Office of Grants and Debarment placed the position of Northwest District Debarment Counsel in Region X. This position covers both Region X and Region VIII, and currently maintains an open caseload of over 125 cases. In N 1993, formal notices of suspension and/or proposed debarment were issued in 21 cases, and formal settlements or closures occurred in 13 cases. Region X emphasizes the use of suspension and debarment in order to protect the public's interest in the integrity of EPA contracting and assistance benefits programs.</p><p><b>6-19</b></p><p><b>,,</b></p><p><b>'.I</b></p><p><b>.'</b></p><p><b>FY I993 Enforcement A k o m p l i s h n t s Report</b></p><p><b><b>Appendix</b><br/>Historical Enforcement Data<br/>List of Penalties by Media</b></p><p><b>List of Headquarters Enforcement Contacts List of Regional Enforcement Information Contacts</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcemenl Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>rp</b></p><p><b>U I</b></p><p><b>W N</b></p><p><b>‘I</b></p><p><b>c rp ‘0</b></p><p><b>! $ h)</b></p><p><b>m</b><br/>c</p><p><b>c c</b></p><p><b>c</b><br/>h ) I</p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Repon</b></b></p><p><b>00</b></p><p><b>rp</b></p><p><b>c:</b></p><p><b>00 v</b></p><p><b>c ,</b></p><p><b><b>c: cn</b><br/>s w<br/>W</b></p><p><b>E!</b><br/>c</p><p><b>8 N</b><br/>c ,</p><p><b>00 cn</b><br/>u )</p><p><b>s</b><br/>c<br/>0</p><p><b>c ,</b></p><p><b>00</b></p><p><b>rp</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 Enforcement Accomplishments Report</b></b></p><p><b>.. .</b></p><p><b>,.</b></p><p><b>.,,</b></p><p><b>. ..</b></p><p><b>U I</b></p><p><b>yjmm</b></p><p><b>... ,</b></p><p><b>...</b><br/>&gt;</p><p><b>,.</b></p><p><b>..</b><br/>,</p><p><b>.i</b></p><p><b>..</b><br/>.</p><p><b>,.</b><br/>,.</p><p><b>;.</b></p><p><b>~.</b></p><p><b>3</b><br/>cl</p><p><b>56</b></p><p><b><b>FY 1993 EnforcemenfAccomplishmenfsReport</b></b></p><p><b><b>t of Civil T u -</b></b></p><p><b>..</b></p><p><b>..</b></p><p><b>and s</b></p><p><b>..</b></p><p><b><b>.

Herb worked at a small little mom and pop business,you know, the kind of place that nets maybe a one or two billion per year. this small place could not afford health insurance for the two children and wife of  this 39yr old man, he only gave his young life and abandoned his wife and children for this greedy corporate giant.  United States Steel Corporation, USX CORPORATION a/k/a USX Corp, L.L.C.  is the company that turned our world upside down, they took everything from us. No insurance, nothing..... no more profit sharing, no more pension, no more over-time,---Herb is dead. Giving his life was not enough payment to earn benefits for his family. we have nothing, they took it from us September 21, 04. All my son and daughter have is a plot of dirt now called home for their father. My future was also stolen! I was and still am Madly in LOVE w/my husband. He was and still is the greatest gift from God.  </blockquote>
