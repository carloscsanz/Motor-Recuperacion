<br>Frequently Asked Questions &#40;FAQ&#41; Related to This Security Update
<br>
<br>Where are the file information details? 
<br>Refer to the reference tables in the Security Update Deployment section for the location of the file information details.
<br>
<br>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality? 
<br>Yes, in addition to addressing the security vulnerability, this security update also prevents Windows components and third-party applications on affected platforms from using the WordPad Word 6 text converter to open Word 6.0 and Write files. When WordPad attempts to open a Word 6.0 or Write file, the file will not open and a dialog box will be displayed. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 975539.
<br>
<br>What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update? 
<br>Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 975539 documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.
<br>
<br>The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update? 
<br>Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in their version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.
<br>
<br>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism? 
<br>No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.
<br>
<br>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do? 
<br>The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site.
<br>
<br>It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see Select a Product for Lifecycle Information. For more information about service packs for these software releases, see Lifecycle Supported Service Packs.
<br>

<br>WordPad and Office Text converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - <A HREF="http://securityvulns.ru/CVE-2009-2506.html">CVE-2009-2506</A>
<br>
<br>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that text converters in Microsoft WordPad and Microsoft Office Word process memory when a user opens a specially crafted Word 97 file.
<br>
<br>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <A HREF="http://securityvulns.ru/CVE-2009-2506.html">CVE-2009-2506</A>.
<br>	
<br>Mitigating Factors for WordPad and Office Text converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - <A HREF="http://securityvulns.ru/CVE-2009-2506.html">CVE-2009-2506</A>
<br>
<br>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
<br>�	
<br>
<br>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.
<br>�	
<br>
<br>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker&#39;s Web site.
<br>�	
<br>
<br>The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
<br>�	
<br>
<br>A Web site that is being used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability would cause a dialog box to appear. The user would be prompted to open the file or not, unless the user had previously unchecked the option, &quot;Always ask before opening this type of file&quot;.

<br>Workarounds for WordPad and Office Text converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - <A HREF="http://securityvulns.ru/CVE-2009-2506.html">CVE-2009-2506</A>
<br>
<br>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.
<br>�	
<br>
<br>Disable the WordPad text converter for Word 97 by restricting access to the converter file
<br>
<br>Run the following commands from an administrator command prompt.
<br>
<br>Note You must undo this workaround prior to installing the security update.
<br>
<br>Depending on your operating system version and your history of operating system upgrades and service packs, some of the files referenced below may not exist.
<br>
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#37;&#92;Common Files&#92;Microsoft 
<br>Shared&#92;TextConv&#92;mswrd832.cnv&quot; /E /P everyone:N 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#40;x86&#41;&#37;&#92;Common Files&#92;Microsoft 
<br>Shared&#92;TextConv&#92;mswrd832.cnv&quot; /E /P everyone:N 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#37;&#92;Windows NT&#92;Accessories&#92;mswrd8.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:N 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#37;&#92;Windows NT&#92;Accessories&#92;mswrd864.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:N 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#40;x86&#41;&#37;&#92;Windows NT&#92;Accessories&#92;mswrd8.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:N
<br>
<br>Impact of workaround. When opening a Word 97 document in WordPad, it will show the binary data instead of the formatted text.
<br>
<br>How to undo the workaround. Run the following commands from an administrator command prompt.
<br>
<br>Depending on your operating system version and your history of operating system upgrades and service packs, some of the file referenced below may not exist.
<br>
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#37;&#92;Common Files&#92;Microsoft Shared&#92;TextConv&#92;mswrd832.cnv&quot; /E /R everyone 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#40;x86&#41;&#37;&#92;Common Files&#92;Microsoft Shared&#92;TextConv&#92;mswrd832.cnv&quot; /E /R everyone 
<br>echo y| cacls &quot;&#37;ProgramFiles&#37;&#92;Windows NT&#92;Accessories&#92;mswrd8.wpc&quot; /E /R everyone

<br>FAQ for WordPad and Office Text converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - <A HREF="http://securityvulns.ru/CVE-2009-2506.html">CVE-2009-2506</A>
<br>
<br>What is the scope of the vulnerability? 
<br>This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
<br>
<br>What causes the vulnerability? 
<br>The vulnerability results from the way that the text converter for Word 97 &#40;included as part of WordPad and as part of the Office text converters&#41; parses a specially crafted Word 97 document.
<br>
<br>What are WordPad Text Converters and Office Text Converters? 
<br>WordPad is a default component of Microsoft Windows operating systems. Text converters in WordPad allow users who do not have Microsoft Office Word installed to open documents in Microsoft Windows Write &#40;.wri&#41; and Microsoft Office Word 6.0, Microsoft Office Word 97, Microsoft Office Word 2000, and Microsoft Office Word 2002 &#40;.doc&#41; file formats. These text converters also allow users to save documents in the Word 6.0 file format.
<br>
<br>Text converters are also a default component of Microsoft Office that allow users to open and save as older Office file formats, including the Word 6.0 file format.
<br>
<br>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? 
<br>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
<br>
<br>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? 
<br>This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted document with an affected version of WordPad or Microsoft Office Word.
<br>
<br>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file using either WordPad or Microsoft Office.
<br>
<br>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a document that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker&#39;s site.
<br>
<br>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability? 
<br>Systems, such as workstations and terminal servers, with WordPad or Microsoft Office Word installed where Word documents are opened from untrusted sources are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
<br>
<br>What does the update do? 
<br>This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that WordPad and the Office Text Converters parse Word 97 documents.
<br>
<br>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed? 
<br>No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
<br>
<br>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited? 
<br>No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
