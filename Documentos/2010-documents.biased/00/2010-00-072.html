<h1 style="text-align: center;">Giga Designs Dual Processor 1.33 GHz
Upgrade</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">an informational article by Chris

When I first purchased my <a
 href="http://eshop.macsales.com/Descriptions/specs/Framework.cfm?page=g4qs.html&amp;title=Power%20Macintosh%20G4%20Quicksilver">Quicksilver
G4 867 MHz</a> single processor
PowerMac
back in
2001, I was hoping that the future would bring some faster upgrades for
it. When <a href="http://www.powerlogix.com">Powerlogix</a> and <a
 href="http://www.gigadesigns.com">Giga Designs</a> first announced
their dual
processor lines, my
curiosity was peaked. From that point on, I monitored people's
reactions and experiences with the two company's products via the
<a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com">xlr8yourmac</a> website, as well
as
other user forums. My decision to finally
go with Giga Designs was
two-fold. <br>
<br>
First, the vast majority of people who had tried their
products had written positive experiences with them. Some of the
most
important endorsements came from other digital audio guys, like myself,
who used the Giga Designs upgrades with their Pro Tools rigs for
recording and
editing
audio. Many of them had great things to say about this product. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the Giga Designs upgrades were also the most
affordable and
seemed like the best bang for my buck. I originally ordered the Giga
Designs dual processor 1.33 GHz (model number <strong
 style="font-weight: normal;">M5D-1213Q)</strong>
upgrade from a Mac vendor who showed a 3 day wait
on the upgrade. After nearly two weeks of waiting, I canceled my order
with them, and called <a href="http://www.macgurus.com/">MacGurus</a>.
MacGurus went out of their way to find
me the upgrade, going so far as to call Giga Designs while I was on the
phone with them. They even asked Giga Designs to overnight me the
product
right from their warehouse! As promised, the box arrived the next day
by 11:00 AM.<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br>

<br>
<br>
Once I opened up the packaging, I found the processor card in a static
free pouch, installation manual, and some software.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 495px; height: 371px;" src="P1060066.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
I noticed some white cylindrical object on the end of the processor
card that said, "ATTENTION" REMOVE BEFORE INSTALLATION. Unfortunately,
I didn't see any information about that in the installation manual. In
fact, the design of this processor upgrade is somewhat different
from the one pictured in the manual. <br>
<br>
I'm one of those guys
that expects things to be detailed, accurate, and up-to-date. I expect
it even more so when I am spending almost $600.00 for it. So now I'm
worried.
I'm going to be messing around inside of my precious Quicksilver, and
I'm going to be performing without
fully up-to-date instructions.
Not good. I went to Giga's site and downloaded the online installation
manual
hoping it would be more up-to-date. Nada. It was even more dissimilar.
I
decided to do what was printed on the cylinder and removed it. I
had a bad feeling of trepidation about installing the processor. Before
I began, I connected myself to ground with a <a
 href="http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WRISTSTRAP">grounding
strap</a>. Although I've gotten away without using them before, with
this upgrade, I wasn't going to take any chances.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Step one was
to remove the old processor. In order to do that you had to remove the
fan
that was right next to it. This was
accomplished by removing the two
screws on the back of the door holding the fan in place, and sliding
the fan out. <br>
<br>
Once that was
done, you just took a flat screwdriver, slipped it sideways behind the
heatsink clips and twisted the screwdriver clockwise prying the clips
loose. Once the heatsink was removed, you could now see 4 phillips-head
screws
holding the
867 mhz card in place. I took a small phillips screwdriver and removed
those screws. I then carefully lifted up on the processor card from
every edge wiggling it until it came loose. Once that was accomplished,
I installed the new card in place. Here is the new processor card
installed with the
case fan still removed:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 496px; height: 372px;" src="P1070067.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
Next, you had to connect a power wire to the new processor card, route
it around the
case door, and connect it to a drive power connector like so. Notice
the case fan is re-installed:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" src="P1070069.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
Now is where I ran into my first big problem. After I reset the CUDA
switch, I
went to shut the door on the tower. I noticed that the fan assembly was
NOT securely attached to the heatsink! I'm really nervous now. I reread
the instructions...nothing. I dug around in the Giga Designs box and
found a small
ziplock bag with 4 VERY small screws in it. I bent down and noticed
that the fan assembly had holes in it. Bigger problem: now that the
processor is
installed, I couldn't get to the holes on the back side of it, so that
means that I now have to <span style="font-weight: bold;">remove</span>
the case fan again, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> the
processor
card. Once I did that, I used a <span style="font-weight: bold;">very</span>
small phillips screwdriver (instructions say that you only need a
medium phillips) to put
the screws into the holes of the fan assembly and secure it to the
heatsink. Even BIGGER problem. Because of the way the processor card is
now designed (different than the illustration in the manuals) I can't
get to
the fourth hole:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="P1070073_B.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
There is no way to get that fourth screw in place unless I unsolder
those components just below the yellow line pointing to where the hole
is. I
decided that the fans were secure enough without the fourth screw in
place. I put everything back together and pressed the power button with
the door open. Giga Designs recommends doing this so that you can make
sure that you are getting power to the cooling fans. Once I saw that
the
fans were spinning, I pulled the power cord, and tried to shut the case
door.
<br>
<br>
Oops! Another problem. When attempting to shut the computer door, there
wasn't
enough clearance between the rear of the Superdrive and the edge of the
new heatsink. I pushed the door toward the rear of the case, but the
heatsink kept catching on some thick tape that was on the rear of the
Superdrive. Removing that tape and pushing the door toward the rear of
the computer allowed me to get it shut, but now I was concerned about
the
heatsink resting directly against the Superdrive. I taped a small strip
of non-static plastic over the rear of the Superdrive. Here is a photo
showing the lack of clearance between the two components:<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="P1070077C.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
To this day I am still not 100% comfortable with the way those
components
are pushing together. Is there too much pressure on the heatsink from
it resting against the
Superdrive? Will there be too much heat from the
heatsink for the Superdrive to handle? <br>
<br>
Once I got the case closed, I connected the computer back to the
monitor and pressed the power button. The computer chimed and began to
boot up! I wanted to see if it booted up any faster than it used to
with the 867 MHz processor in it. After 3 minutes of the blue progress
bar stuck just before the login screen, I began to suspect that
something
was wrong. After 5 minutes, I shut the computer down.
Reboot...same deal. Definitely not good. I shut down, and tried to boot
the computer holding down the shift key. Nada. It still got stuck at
the progress bar just before the login screen. I then tried to boot
holding down the command key (apple key) + S. The computer booted to
the command line perfectly. At the command prompt, I ran the command:<br>
<br>
fsck -yf<br>
<br>
pressed the enter key, and the computer finished saying that everything
appeared to be ok. I typed<br>
<br>
reboot<br>
<br>
pressed the enter key, and this time the computer booted to the login
window!!!<br>
<br>
Once I logged in, I ran the Disk Utility to check that my drive
permissions were intact. After that I decided to try to overclock the
processor to 1.4 GHz. Needless to say, at least for me and this
upgrade, that was a huge <span style="font-weight: bold;">mistake</span>.
After I changed the dip switch
settings, reset the CUDA, and closed the case back up, I plugged in the
power cord and was extremely surprised when the computer immediately
powered up by itself. I never even touched the power button. I pulled
the plug,
plugged it in again, same thing: instant power-on. This time, however,
I was going to try to let it boot up, but there didn't seem to be any
video signal getting to the monitor. I pulled the plug, and reset the
CUDA again. This time when I
plugged in the power cable, nothing happened. <br>
<br>
For a BRIEF moment, I was excited and happy. I pressed the power button
and it flashed silently- BUT THAT WAS IT! No power, no chime, no
drives spinning up...nothing. Just the power button flashing once, and
then going
out. I disconnected the computer, opened it up, and reset the CUDA
again. Nothing. Next I tried removing the PRAM battery for 20 minutes.
Nothing. Every time I pressed the power button, it would light up, and
then go out. At this point I'm trying not to freak out thinking that I
may have destroyed my power supply. <br>
<br>
So I did what I thought all veteran upgraders would do when faced with
this situation. I completely removed the new upgrade, re-installed the
old 867 mhz card, pressed the CUDA button and....nothing. I pulled the
power cord out of the back of the computer, plugged it back in, and the
computer CHIMED and began to boot up! <br>
<br>
Now that I got it booting again, I set the new dual
processor upgrade speed back down to 1.33 GHz and reinstalled it. I
plugged all of the cables back in, pressed the power button, and it
too, chimed, and booted flawlessly.<br>
<br>
From that point on, this has been an absolutely incredible experience.
I can't explain it. Once these initial problems were resolved, the
computer has now been running for over 2 weeks FLAWLESSLY. There hasn't
been one crash requiring a reboot yet. It has really made a remarkable
difference in real world performance as well. While you don't really
notice dramatic speed changes in the Finder, you suddenly realize that
you
get a feeling that there is now MUCH MORE POWER to spare. <br>
<br>
The entire GUI,
while not feeling necessarily faster, has a fluidity in it that wasn't
present
before this upgrade. The computer multitasks now in ways it never could
previously. I ran some real world tests before and after the upgrade. A
number of them I conducted just after logging out of my user account,
and logging back in. Since I never shut down my computer, this made
more sense for me rather than running certain tests after a fresh
reboot. Where that took place, I tried to note it. Most of the tests
that checked the time required to open an application were based upon
the first time the application was opened. I ran each test
twice on each processor daughtercard (867 MHz and 1.33 GHz Dual). Here
are the system specs of the Quicksilver before the processor upgrade:<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSION</span><br>
</h3>
</div>
As you can see from these tests, there are certain areas where this
upgrade makes HUGE differences, and others where there are lesser, yet
nonetheless, noticeable&nbsp; improvements. This computer has to last
me for many years to come, and I am pretty confident that it will do
just that barring any unforeseen problems with this upgrade. Some items
to note:<br>
1. Remove the case fan first.<br>
2. Make sure that the cooling fan assembly is secured to the heatsink
BEFORE installing the processor upgrade.<br>
3. You might want to remove the thick tape that is on the Superdrive
before attempting to
shut the door, and possibly replace it with something thinner. (Do this
at your own risk!)<br>
4. Attempting to overclock your processor MAY cause you big problems.
Don't panic. Reinstall the original processor card and start over.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3>THANK YOUs</h3>

<br>
A big thank you to MacGurus and Giga Designs for getting me this
processor upgrade so quickly. Thank you
