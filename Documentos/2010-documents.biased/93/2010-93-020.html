          different documents created in GoogleDocs or uploaded as another document
          type, such as PDF.
          There is a limit of 100 MB of uploaded files, which should be plenty
          of space, especially if images are stored in Picasa and videos are
          stored in YouTube.There is also no data management tool, to aggregate
          assessment data.
          There is not an interactivity feature to this program,
          such as found in a blog or wiki. Therefore, this tool would work for
          a presentation
        portfolio but not for formative or summative assessment.This tool is

          of
          outcome, goals
          or standards.
          This tool is a web site creator, where students can <strong>embed</strong> different

          such as PDF, or embed video (from Google Video or YouTube).The only
           data management tool is the GoogleDocs spreadsheet, to aggregate assessment
          data. There are lots of interactivity features to this program, such
          as
          the capability to subscribe to changes in sites or individual pages,
          or collaborate on pages in the same way as GoogleDocs. Therefore,
          this tool would work for both a presentation portfolio and
          for formative or summative assessment.</p>
