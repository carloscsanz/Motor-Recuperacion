				<p>we have all heard the terms <em>apple head</em> vs. <em>deer head</em> when it comes to describing characteristics of the <a title="chihuahua breed" href="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-facts/chihuahua-breed-standards/" target="_self">chihuahua breed</a>, but what exactly makes an <em>apple head</em> chihuahua different from a <em>deer head</em> chihuahua?</p>
<p><a href="http://store.famouschihuahua.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4097" title="apple head chihuahua puppy" src="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/applehead-chihuahuapuppy.jpg" alt="apple head chihuahua puppy" width="470" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>the term <em>apple head</em> is used to describe any chihuahua with a round or &#8216;dome-like&#8217; head similar to the shape of an apple. the upper part of the chihuahua’s skull is wider than the lower part in the jaw area.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2714" title="adult apple head chihuahua" src="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple-head-chihuahua.jpg" alt="adult apple head chihuahua" width="300" height="328" /></p>
<p>if you look close at the top of the skull of most chihuahuas, you will notice that it is slightly sunken in just like the top of an apple. this area is called <em>molera</em>, a spanish word for &#8216;fontanel&#8217;, or any membranous gap between the bones of the cranium in an infant or fetus and it is similar to the ‘soft spot’ that human babies have on their heads upon birth.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2715" title="close up of a chihuahua skull" src="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/chihuahua-skull.jpg" alt="close up of a chihuahua skull" width="300" height="323" /></p>
<p>according to <a title="chihuahua breed standards" href="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-facts/chihuahua-breed-standards/" target="_self">chihuahua breed standards</a>, the term <em>apple head</em> is required in the description of the ‘head’ of a chihuahua that includes an apple domed skull with either the presence or absence of <em>molera</em>. it is also used when referencing chihuahua puppies at an age where it is noticeable.</p>
<p>the term <em>deer head</em> is used to describe any chihuahua that does not have the characteristic apple shaped head. deer head chihuahuas tend to have a longer noses and a head shape similar to that of a miniature young deer. they also tend to have less <a title="chihuahua health problems" href="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-health-problems/" target="_self">chihuahua health problems</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2716" title="teaka the deerhead chihuahua" src="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/teaka-deerhead-chihuahua.jpg" alt="teaka the deerhead chihuahua" width="350" height="317" /></p>
<p>in this picture of <a title="teaka the famous chihuahua" href="http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-videos/naughty-naughty-famous-chihuahua/" target="_self">teaka the famous chihuahua</a>, you can see her deer-like features, so she is a deer head chihuahua. at birth she was given the temporary name of <em>fawn</em>, which means a young deer under a year old.</p>

				<p>can you tell whether a small pup will be apple head of deer head right off the bat?  We are getting a pup and he will be 8 weeks on July 6th, but I am not totally sure if he is apple head or deer head.  His mother is deer head, but I have not seen his father yet.  He looks pretty round as of now, but i also have a side profile photo of him and he looks like he could also go deer head.  Any ideas?</p>

				<p>I have a deer head chihuahua and many people ask me if she is a mix. Her body is much longer than typical chihuahuas too. Her papers say she is pure bred chihuahua but the longer shape of her head really throws people off. She&#8217;s adorable nonetheless!</p>

				<p>Mariana, I get the same thing from people too about my Chi Mr.Pants. His mama was an applehead and his father was deer. The mix of the 2 different kinds made Mr. Pants larger than most chis with an applehead but long snout. Lol but he&#8217;s adorable nonetheless. </p>
<p>I recently got another baby chi I have no idea what she will turn out like. I didn&#8217;t get to see her parents. She&#8217;s small, her head looks larger but at 7 weeks she is the size of a medium sized rat! Very hard to tell. I came here looking to see if there was a distinct difference so I can tell now.</p>

				<p>Oh no Chi Momma you are right, they are a beautiful breed indeed. I also have both deer &amp; applehead Chi&#8217;s. I love them all the same. What I have noticed is besides their differences in appearence, the deer Chi&#8217;s seem to be a little bit more spastic and full of energy compared to the apples. Not to say apples aren&#8217;t full of energy, they are but my deers seem to be more spastic and they do tend to shake more. Probably because they are smaller. Both types are loving lap dogs and boy are they all cuties! Anyone else tend to agree? Id love to hear what other owners of both types have to say. twitter.com/o0ochillyo0o</p>

				<p>Both are cute. However, the national breeding standards in my country specifically mention the apple head as the characteristical trait of the chihuahua.  Deer heads are not bred according to their standard.  It&#8217;s something to take into account if you would like to show your chi.  But even if you aren&#8217;t planning on showing your chi, you might want to think twice about your deerhead seller if he isn&#8217;t breeding according to standards.  Make sure to buy from a shelter of certified chihuahua breeder. Too many sellers are covering up that they&#8217;ve actually gotten their puppies from puppy mills or flown in from developing nations, which could leave you with high vet costs not to mention a broken heart.</p>

				<p>I also have both types (4 total) one I bought from a backyard breeder. He&#8217;s now 12 lbs, and I saw both of his parents, mom a long hair and dad a short hair. The other 3 are rescues, one from the pound. I have 3 dear heads and 1 apple head, and they all range in size from 4 lbs to 12 lbs. I love them all with a passion. They&#8217;re my babies! They have brave hearts and lots of personality and energy. My 4 lbs is a dear head and she dances to the tune of &#8220;Dancing Queen&#8221;.</p>

				<p>I have a deer head that weighs 12 pounds.  He has long hair and a long body.  Both his parents were short hair chihuahuas.  Is this a different breed of chihuahua?  He is totally devoted to me and I once ran into a woman who knew exactly what breed he was (which isn&#8217;t the usual) because she had the same type and knew how loving and devoted they were.  I&#8217;d love to get another some day but wouldn&#8217;t know where to look as I bought him through a friend that isn&#8217;t breeding anymore.</p>

				<p>My Pebbles seems to be a mix of the two.  She is about 10 lbs, 11 months old and has the slender body and long legs. Her eyes are large and slightly bulgy. Her ears smaller than the &#8220;deer&#8221; chihuahua  I have seen.  Her coat is tan with a cream white streak that goes from her neck to the rip of the bottom of her tail.  She has black on her back.</p>
<p>She really looks like the Techichi dog pictures. When she was a small puppy she looked like a tiny dingo. lol SOOO cute!</p>
<p>Her favorite thing to do is to fetch a tennis ball that looks like it would be too big for her mouth&#8230;haha  She&#8217;s a really fast runner, too.  If she sees a tennis ball in your hand she&#8217;s in the other side of the yard already waiting for you to throw it. </p>
<p>Her other favorite thing is to cuddle, mess with the cats,  and follow me everywhere.  It seems like she chose me as her favorite person, but, loves my husband and daughter, too.  She&#8217;s great with other people and wants to make friends with every other dog she has met out on walks.   </p>
<p>Pebbles is a great dog and I love her! </p>
<p>We adopted one of her brothers, Brutus, too. He was a beautiful tri-color and bigger than she was when we got them at 8 weeks old.  (he could stand over her). Unfortunately, they BOTH (ugh!!!) tested positive for Parvovirus a few days after we got them.  Brutus died.  Man&#8230; that really hurt my heart to have to tell my 9 year old when she got home from school!! (They were born at a shelter&#8230; there mother were given up pregnant because the people who owned their mother had &#8220;too many dogs&#8221;&#8230; whatever that means).</p>

				<p>i have deerhead type too and i like the way he looks more then the applehead .and he is very lean a thin  and i notice that a lot of  deer type  seem to stay thin  and not gain as much weight as an apple head  he is 7rs  and  his weight 4lbs  since he been 18mos   never gains an oz . and if you look back at one time most chi were like a deer head  so i think the akc should allow them too in the ring as long asthey are the standard weight and height</p>

				<p>Love the comments on deer head and apple head chihuahuas.  I have both sort of.  I have an apple head name Belle who will be 3 years old this December.  And, I have a deer head named Dottie who will be 8 months old this month.  However, dottie is not a full blood Chi.  She is acually a Chi-Pin.  So what do you guys think.  Is Dottie a deer head because she is part min-pin?  She is so cute.  She is white with chocolate circles around her eyes and chocolate ears.  She is adorable.  Belle is all black with fawn markings on her feet. She is gorgeous.  Belle weighs only 5 lbs. and Dottie is pushing 7lbs.  She is turning out to be the bigger of the two.  In addition, Belle has a smooth coat and Dottie has a rough coat.  But, I love them both.  They are my sweet babies and they know it.  Belle is quite and reserved and Dottie loves to play.  She and our cat (Kitty-Kitty) play and play and play.  They have so much fun.  It is a joy to watch them.  I just love chihuahuas!</p>

				<p>I have a deer head chi that looks exactly like a minuture pincher in color except she&#8217;s long haired and a wonderful dog.  I&#8217;m new to chi&#8217;s but we couldn&#8217;t love her more.  Does not have the problems of a apple head in the degree of not being able to breath or the open skull.  She is bigger then your normal chi but she is very friendly to all she comes in contact with.  When I say bigger I mean she is about 11 pounds but very thin.  I would have another chi in a heartbeat!!!  Don&#8217;t care whether she is an apple or a deer head&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I have a 2 year old 3 lb male chihuahua. i always thought he was a applehead. But he has the longer deer like legs. So I don&#8217;t know what he is to be. He was sold to me as an applehead and he is AKC registered as a chihuahua. So now my delima is looking for another one to keep him company and wanting her to look just like him. How do you know if they are going to have the longer legs when they are 8 weeks old? I couldn&#8217;t tell from my Titus when he was a baby until he grew. You can see pics of him on myspace, in my pics myspace.com/jennifersperry</p>

				<p>I have two chis, both apple-heads. Dobby, my oldest, is blonde, and weighs around 11 lbs. My other chi, Miel, is chocolate with white markings and weighs 7 lbs.  Dobby came from a breeder. His mother was a long haired apple head and his father was a short hair apple head. Miel was a rescue foster puppy that I fell in love with, so I never saw his parents. He doesn&#8217;t resemble the typical chi, because his eyes are very light colored.<br />
It seems to me that lots of deer-head chis don&#8217;t look very much like chis at all. Many pics I&#8217;ve seen of deer-heads look as though they have been mixed with some other breed, with their long snouts, straight ears, and long legs..there is something about their eyes that just doesn&#8217;t say &#8216;chihuahua&#8217; to me. Not to say they aren&#8217;t just as sweet. <img src='http://www.famouschihuahua.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
