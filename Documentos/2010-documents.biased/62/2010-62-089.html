Dave, I keep visiting sites and seeing these cool search boxes that let you either search their entire site or search the entire Google database, all without leaving that page!  I want to have something like this and would appreciate your helping me figure out the code needed.

Dave's Answer:


<p>
This is a question that's going to result in some HTML listings. You know that, so there's no reason to panic!
<p>
First off, the good news. Google itself actually has a nice page offering you HTML code you can just cut and paste onto your own Web pages to produce the search box you seek, and some variants beside. Just check out <a href="http://www.google.com/searchcode.html" target="new">Google Free</a>.
<p>
Instead of relying on the bright sparks at Google, though, let's go through the steps of building our own search box instead, so you'll be able to see <i>how</i> it works.
<p>
Also, not to pick on Google because I think the world of those folk, but their HTML samples could be cleaned up a bit, usually, so I've also recast it as proper XHTML rather than somewhat sloppy HTML. Just don't tell Larry and Sergey, okay?
<p>
The basic technique involved here is to be able to manipulate one of the variables handed to the Google search engine, a variable called <b>sitesearch</b>. Set it to a null value and you're searching the entire World Wide Web, but set it to a specific domain and it's constrained exactly as if you had typed in the Google special notation <b>site:<i>domain</i></b>.
<p>
In addition to that, you need an input field and a submit button. Put them all together and here's the minimalist Google search form that lets the user alternate between just your site (well, in this case just my site) or the entire Web:
<pre class="code">&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search"&gt;

&lt;input type="text"   name="q" size="31"
 maxlength="255" value="" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Google Search" /&gt;
&lt;input type="radio"  name="sitesearch" value="" /&gt;
 The Web
&lt;input type="radio"  name="sitesearch"
 value="askdavetaylor.com" checked /&gt; Ask Dave Taylor&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
There are some additional tweaks we can apply to make it a bit more fancy, including changing the radio buttons to a single check box, and aligning things a bit more nicely using a table and some simple CSS:
<pre class="code">&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search"&gt;

&lt;div style="border:1px solid black;padding:4px;width:20em;"&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;input type="text"   name="q" size="25"
 maxlength="255" value="" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Google Search" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center" style="font-size:75%"&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"  name="sitesearch"
 value="askdavetaylor.com" checked /&gt; only search Ask Dave Taylor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
Here's how that renders when included on an HTML page:
<br /><br />
<form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search">

<div style="border:1px solid black;padding:4px;width:25em;">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td>
<input type="text"   name="q" size="25" 
 maxlength="255" value="" />
<input type="submit" value="Google Search" /></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" style="font-size:75%">
<input type="checkbox"  name="sitesearch"
 value="askdavetaylor.com" checked /> only search Ask Dave Taylor<br /> 
</td></tr></table>
</div>

</form>

If you'd like to use this on your own site, simply change the occurrences of <b>askdavetaylor.com</b> as appropriate.
<p>
Not too hard at all!

     <p>If it's working properly, the search box should send you to the Google site, but with the word or words you typed in prefilled in as the search terms. Is this not what you're seeing?  If so, what are you seeing?  Also, what happens when you type in a term on the search box at the end of my article?  Does that work for you?</p>

     <p>John, you'll laugh when you find out how easy that is!  The line </p>

<p>&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search"&gt;</p>

<p>just needs to have    target="new"    added and it'll redirect the result of that form to a new window called "new". If you always want to guarantee that a new window is launched rather than possibly reusing the 'new' window, use "_blank" as the target instead:</p>

<p>&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search" target="_blank"&gt;</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

   <div class="comments-body" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #666;">
     <p>Thanks for your note, David. Checking on "search my site" in the form causes the search to automatically include "site:yourdomain" so that it only searches pages in the Google database that have your domain as the base of the URL. In essence, it's a search engine for your site alone. Matches then go back to your site. Hope that clears things up!</p>

     <p>You can't use the Google search tool to find content on your site if you don't want Google to see it, Adam, so you'll need to install a search engine of your own on your server. If that's a possibility, then I'd talk with your Web hosting provider because they might already have something installed. Good luck!</p>

     <p>It is my understanding that you can get paid by Google when people use your site's Google search box.  How does that work?  Do the ads have to be able to pop up on your site or can the inquiries be sent to the Google website, leaving our website free of clutter?  How do you set it up so that we get paid when people use our search box?  I have tried to find the answer in Google's help pages but I just can't seem to get a solid answer anywhere.</p>

<p>We are also trying to customize the appearance of our Google search box so that it fits within a certain space designated on our website.  Any recommendations?</p>

<p>I am at my wits end and desperate for help!</p>

     <p>I'm trying to add the Google search to my blog, but it doesn't seem to work. Perhaps I'm inserting it in the wrong location. Perhaps I need different code because it's a blog, not a web site. Any help would be appreciated. The blog's purpose is to facilitate communication among former high school classmates, many of whom do not seem to be very Internet savvy. I'm hoping a "search this site" function will help them to locate names more easily</p>

   <div class="comments-body" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #666;">
     <p>Two issues, Jillian. First off, you need to not send the "http://" part in your 'sitesearch' field, but more importantly, a search of Google shows that it doesn't have a single page of your site in its search engine, so there's no way for it to ever succeed. Try searching for 'site:www.askdavetaylor.com', for example, then search for 'site;vespa-rosso.blogspot.com' and you'll see what I mean.  Sorry!</p>

     <p>Dave, I'll fix the first part (the http), but I also noticed the google search thing.  How can I change this?  I listed my site with google about a week or two ago.  Thanks!<br />

    </div>
  
   <div class="comments-body" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #666;">
     <p>You might just need to have some patience, Jillian. Google has a "sandbox" where brand new sites and domains are parked for a few weeks up to a few months before they're added to the full Google database. That's so spam sites don't just pop up and corrupt / pollute the Google database, but it's darn frustrating for us legitimate content providers. Sorry!</p>

     <p>Hi Dave, I've read all your comments to other posts and I'm using CityMax for my host and they don't offer a search box for my site.  I'd love to have one that just searches my site and no advertisements.. google seems to have a problem with my site since it's through a host and not mine... :(Can you help me with how to add a search box to my site that only returns items from my site with pictures?  Like any one of the pages listed below would be fantastic.<br />

     <p>Hi Dave,</p>

<p>I ve got the google search on one of my sites and it works great for searhced throughout that site. <br />
However I would like to have the search box search sites "a" "b" &  "c" all at the same. So far i can only get it to either serach teh whole web or just the one site. Ive tried checking all teh radio buttons, but this just makes its search teh last one.</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>

     <p>Balaji, you'll want to learn more about the robots.txt file, and specifically the equivalent meta tag you can add to specific pages that tell search engines not to include those pages in indices.

     <p>Youx, I don't really understand what your expectations of AdSense are: you don't want ads for your own site on AdSense, because then you'd be paying for click-thrus that are from people already at your site. Make sense?</p>

     <p>A couple of questions: <br />
I know the first one has been asked a couple of times here but I haven't seen an answer yet. Can you get the google results to come up on your own page, instead of transferring to the google website?</p>

<p>And is there any way of tracking what people are searching for, when they use the search box on your site? Any ideas of how you can do this? </p>

     <p>George, Trudes, no, you can't do that without some sneaky hacking behind the scenes that Google won't look upon happily.  In terms of what they're searching for, yes, you could theoretically create a search box that feeds the search query to an intermediate script that logs their search pattern then bounces them directly to Google. Hmmm.... :-)</p>

     <p>When you use google as a search engine on your own site, I think you still need to display the Google graphic.  (See Section 2.3 Attribution at <a href="http://www.google.com/services/terms_free.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/services/terms_free.html</a> ). Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

     <p>Hello, recently I decided to add a search feature to a site I'm constructing, <a href="http://skee.zaiph.net" rel="nofollow">http://skee.zaiph.net</a><br />
However, the Google search bar doesn't work! If I attempt to search for any keywords whatsoever while on the "Search this site" option, no results appear.<br />
The site uses an iFrame, is there a chance that this may have effected the searches? <br />
Also, when I was on the panel that enables me to control the search bar (I am using the free one that enables the site's banner to display on the results pages), it states only 1 page is registered for my site.<br />
How can I add more of my site's pages to the Google database? Why isn't the search bar working?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! Also, if this helps any, the link to the Google searchbar is at <br />

     <p>James, the reason that Google isn't finding your search results is because your site is just too new. Your best bet for getting into the Google database is simply to have sites point to you and make sure that each of your pages points to all your other pages. Then just have some patience!</p>

     <p>Steve, that's a basic JavaScript trick: make sure that the input field has an explicit name (which it should anyway, let's call it "fieldname" for this explanation) and that the form itself has a name (add a name="formname" attribute within the FORM tag itself), then in the BODY tag add the following attribute:</p>

<p>   onLoad="'document.formname.fieldname.focus();"</p>

<p>that should be all you need to do!</p>

     <p>Using the "google search" seems reltively easy as you explained! It seems the only search I get is from my index (home) page? What is the proper code to search all pages? I'm the novice here when it comes to html and my site is as "green" as can get for expertise! Thanks so much and I do enjoy all the reading! You're very knowledgable and appreciated! </p>

     <p>Thanks a lot for the code, but I couldn't get it to search an internal database on an internal network (my code for database search was as value="K:\InternalDatabase\" (drive and file names changed for security reasons, yet the format is exactly how I have it)). Do you know if I can make the database searchable with Google Search?</p>

Is it possible not to have it outlined?</p>

     <p>Miriam, that's easy. Just take out the </p>

<p>  border:1px solid black;</p>

<p>from the code snippet (it's in the "div" tag) making sure not to remove the quote just before it, and you'll have the box and search function without the black box line!</p>

     <p>I was wondering, I want to put this google bar in my banner on my page, but I am building it in Fireworks and there is no code view, can I do this? I also will be using either Dreamweaver or FrontPage, could I put it in my banner using one of these programs? I would use the banner as a background image except I have my buttons on it so I am going to have to import it as multiple Fireworks files. Help would be great! Thanks!</p>

     <p>I added the Google site search to my site last year.  But it does not find new content.  </p>

<p>For example, I added the terms "yankee doodle dandy" to a test page back on 9/9/2005.  However, upon a "site" search, it does not locate the page with that term.</p>

<p>Can I assume that my site must be re-indexed by Google before any new content will be found?  </p>

     <p>I am truly amazed by this site! Why are you doing this? WHEN are you doing this? - Anyway, I very much like the 'additional tweaks' version of the script on top of this page. Can you also do it the other way round? I mean, what is the code to create a decent search box and submit button just to search your own site and a little check box underneath if you want to search all of Google?</p>

<p>Thanks. <br />

     <p>You can most definitely tweak things. Have a look at how I integrated the AdSense for Search system into my Intuitive Life blog, actually:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intuitive.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intuitive.com/blog/</a></p>

<p>(it's on the right nav bar, about half-way down the page)</p>

<p>Then read this to see how it was done:</p>

     <p>I added your google search tags to my webpage, which didn't pass XHTML validation. To be sure, I pasted your tags on an empty page, but it still earned one error as below. Please help!</p>

<p>+++++++++++++<br />
the name and VI delimiter can be omitted from an attribute specification only if SHORTTAG YES is specified.</p>

<p> value="askdavetaylor.com" checked /> only search Ask Dave Taylor</p>

<p>"VI delimiter" is a technical term for the equal sign. This error message means that the name of an attribute and the equal sign cannot be omitted when specifying an attribute. A common cause for this error message is the use of "Attribute Minimization" in document types where it is not allowed, in XHTML for instance.</p>

<p>How to fix: For attributes such as compact, checked or selected, do not write e.g &lt;option selected ... but rather &lt;option selected="selected" ...<br />

     <p>Hi Dave - I'm using frontpage to design my site and am having some problems with the search box.  I copied the code you gave me onto my site and it doesn't seem to return any results.  I understand that it won't return anything results from my site yet since I just registered with Google, but shouldn't it return results for searches outside of my site?  Right now, when I click the button, nothing happens.</p>

<p>Help - and thanks for all the good advice.</p>

     <p>Mohamed, I guess it depends on how you define "legal". There's no *law* saying you can't do that, and I really can't imagine that Google is going to notice or really care if you tweak with the script if you're sending them traffic. However, I do recall that the terms of service for searches indicates you shouldn't be monkeying with the script.  </p>

     <p>First thanks for all the helpful information. I imported the code and when I search "my" site, for a word, for example, Necklaces, it returns results from my shopping cart software, but not from my site proper.  When do a Google site search for www.maggies107.com, I get the first page of my site, and the shopping cart data.  What do I need to do to get the balance of my website to show up?  Would including the sitemap for the Google information cure this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the info.  Appreciate the service, as I am in the boonies with no other brains to pick.</p>

     <p>This page requires Unicode support of your browser. You need "Arial Unicode MS" font to properly access this page. If you see any junk characters, square boxes or question mark, it shows that you do not have unicode font installed on your machine. Microsoft Office 2000 or higher version comes with this font.

     <p>Hi Dave!  Wicked awesome plugin.  But, I do have a query.</p>

<p>First: It works.  No sweat.<br />
Second: Whenever I add the code checked="checked" somehow after I submit the changes, it wipes that particular string out.  nothing else, just that.  Like it's invalid & trying to get rid of it.  Any clue why?  I can't get the code to make the box checked.<br />
Alternately, I'd be happy with no check box, so it ONLY searched my site.  I couldn't finagle the code to do that though.  Any clue?<br />
Thanks!</p>

     <p>My server has a pre-coded search query box that searches just my site and does what I need for the most part. I am satisified with that aspect, yet is there a code I can insert within their code that will HIGHLIGHT the search result? I have an example for test search box on the url:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/upchurch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/upchurch.htm</a></p>

<p>A search of 'Chicago' yields 13 results, but I have a lot of text on the site and I feel the users will get frustrated trying to find their keyword without a highlight tag.</p>

<p>Or another option, is there a code that will make it jump to the first result within the website, then a next button, similar to the search option for a keyword in Microsoft Word Document that will make it jump right to the next result?</p>

<p>FrontPage has an insert search box option, but I have a code conflict with my server and I'd rather just use the servers code and I insert their code manually. My site is new and hasn't been listing on Google yet so the Google search box isn't an option yet.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your assistance to others, I have been reading a lot of your site today.<br />

It seems that it only wishes to search my index.html page and not search through all of my .html pages.</p>

<p>If you could get back to me that would be most appreciated.</p>

     <p>Wayne, that is the problem I had in the beginning, trying to get it to searc all of my pages. With more reading into the how to section, I found I had to add under the control panel/sites, some wildcard entries to have it hit all of my pages.</p>

<p>Fill in your site name and add each URL:</p>

<p>*.puddleofmuddfanpage.*<br />
<a href="http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/*" rel="nofollow">http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/*</a><br />
<a href="http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/public_html" rel="nofollow">http://www.puddleofmuddfanpage.com/public_html</a></p>

<p>I have those 3 listed and it searches all of my pages. So it appears you should have a minimum of those 3 versions. It works with no problems, I added it to my front page in the left column if you want to take a look.  Also if you type in a keyword, such as Chicago, if you view it in cached option, it highlights it to make finding the keyword easier. I have a lot of text on my pages, so I added those directions above the search box so users would be able to find what they are looking for easily. Hope this helps!</p>

     <p>Wayne, is it possible that your site simply isn't fully indexed by Google?  Try doing a search like site:askdavetaylor.com (with your domain name rather than mine) and see how many pages match. That's an easy way to see what's in the index...</p>

     <p>Colleen, I hope that you have some sort of template or other system built around a content management system (a blog, something like Article Manager, whatever) so that you can apply changes quickly?  Failing that, some server-side includes (SSI) that lets you change one file and deliver up the changes to all of your pages?  Otherwise, well, you have a tedious task ahead of you..</p>

Very much appreciate the code. I narrowed the box and input field and dropped the border and it looks like it just grew there :-)</p>

<p>Oh well, Adsense won't pay the mortgage on my house yet, but it's almost to the point of paying for the website rent. Progress ... not perfection.</p>

     <p>This web site is to search for words within the web site, so I would like to use my own search button like I've seen everywhere on other sites. I have seen the Google Search that gives you two options, to search thru Google or thru the web site itself, but when you chose to search thru the web site Google jumps in and the words you selected are listed with your web site link at an outside Google listing. I would like for people to type a word inside the search box and to jump straight to where that first word is and so forth. Is there an easy way to achieve this?</p>

<p>I'm not technical at all and time is of the essence to get this set up for our members and everyone out there. We conduct paranormal research and educate the community in the paranormal field.</p>

<p>I can even go as far as letting someone design my search button with that purpose and give him/her credit on the web site... This is an extension of a non-profit organization, Paranormal Awareness Society, Corp. and we need help.</p>

<p>Please help me.</p>

     <p>Thank goodness I found this answer I had done all sorts of searches and could not find code I wanted. Now the hard part. The code works fine. But is there a way to get the terms that people searched for from this form. That way I can learn better what they are looking for and tweak the content. This would be great! I am running on windows server and did not know if have to have database set up or could just get e-mail?</p>

     <p>If you had access to your server, you could write a rudimentary CGI script that simply logged the search string and then bounced it to Google. That's probably a three line shell script in Linux, for example:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh<br />
logfile="yourdirectory/search.log"<br />
echo $QUERY_STRING >> $logfile<br />
echo "Location: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?$QUERY_STRING" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?$QUERY_STRING"</a><br />
echo ""</p>

<p>exit 0</p>

     <p>You bet. Simply change that first DIV to remove the "padding" parameter:</p>

<p>&lt;div style="border:1px solid black;width:20em;"&gt;</p>

<p>You can also tweak the width to fit your constraints too, including using a pixel count instead (e.g. "width:100px;")</p>

I Have the same query as that of nick, <br />
"I added the Google site search to my site last year. But it does not find new content. </p>

<p>For example, I added the terms "yankee doodle dandy" to a test pagee recently, However, upon a "site" search, it does not locate the page with that term.</p>

<p>Can I assume that my site must be re-indexed by Google before any new content will be found? " </p>

<p>if so please suggest some simpler and faster indexing method as my website content changes frequently.<br />
Thanks</p>

     <p>Badshah, you need to wait until the Google spider sees your new pages. One way for that to happen more quickly is to frequently update your site with new content, which teaches it to visit you more often.</p>

<p>Greg, yes, you can do that. Add "target="_blank" within the FORM tag and you'll find that the search results pop up in a new window.</p>

     <p>Martin, as I said earlier in this stream of comments, yes, you can do that. Add "target="_blank" within the FORM tag and you'll find that the search results pop up in a new window. :-) </p>

   <div class="comments-body" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #666;">
     <p>Tom, undoubtedly your search engine doesn't work the same way that Google does. Most importantly, you need to do a search and then look at the URL your search engine uses to identify the *name of the search term variable*. With Google, it's "q", and that's what this script produces too. If your system uses, say, "searchterm", then just tweak my script to use that variable name instead.</p>

     <p>Dave, I have been pouring over this code and I can't seem to figure out why my search box won't fill the google search textbox when I click on the button.  Do I have to use a submit button?  Right now I am using an image for my button and I think that may be what it has to be.  I am using IE7 and when I copy and paste your code it still doesn't work.  They only difference in my code is the CSS id's, etc.  That won't affect the functionality of the form.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

     <p>Hi Dave. Maybe I've missed this somewhere, but how do I get the search to only look at one directory in my domain? I'm looking for it to only search files in my help file, but not to look in the rest of the site. I'm unsuccessful. I looked at that bot thing, and i didn't see an answer.</p>

<p>So, for example, it currently looks at www.mywebsite.com, but I want it to look at www.mywebsite.com/directoryA</p>

<p>Is there a way to do that? Entering that path simply returns o results.</p>

     <p>As far as I can tell, Cally, there *is* no way to actually have a target= value that opens up a new tab; that's up to the browser software and indeed there are browsers that don't support tabs (for example, cell phone browsers).</p>

<p>Further, the entire target attribute is deprecated in the XHTML standard, so we should theoretically have stopped using it anyways...</p>

It worked for months.  Do you know what happened?</p>

     <p>Can you make the search result pop up in another window, like this HTML code for a link: </p>

<p>target="_blank"</p>

     <p>Jack, yes you can do just that by adding that attribute to the FORM tag. So instead of having something like</p>

<p>FORM METHOD="get" ACTION="xxx"</p>

<p>you have</p>

<p>FORM METHOD="get" ACTION="xxx" TARGET="_blank"</p>

     <p>Dave, I am designing a site for a friend who is an artist. She wants visitors to be able to search for images and be taken directly to that image. e.g. say she has a painting of a frog or frogs, if someone enters frog in a search box she wants all the frog paintings to show up. Is this possible? Preferably for free? Or am I asking too much.<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

I'm designing a Web directory and would like to find out if you are allowed to put a Google search box in your site without Google's permission. In the design I have already created the search box using the code I found on this site and I have also inserted the Google logo. Do I have to get Google's permission? Thanks.</p>

     <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Can u please tell me how can i make this form, running inside an asp.net form ?<br />
The main problem is that i want the google search form integrated inside the main asp form, ( which has the attribute "runat="server" ). If i exclude the code above from the main form, everything works fine, but the search form will flow after the first one ( so, teh search will be at teh bottom of teh page). If i include teh search form in teh main form, it wont work anymore :|.<br />
Any solution will be kindly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thx,<br />

     <p>Dave,</p>

<p>I've cut and pasted your code for the Google Search and it works great, however, in the frame of the search box "maxlength 255 value=""/>" is listed.  Also, at the bottom it also says "value=divine9online.com checked /> only search divine9online.co"  Shouldn't that text be hidden in HTML view? Please advize.  Thanks</p>

   <div class="comments-body" style="border-bottom:1px dotted #666;">
     <p>Mike, I think your problem is that when you cut and pasted, you ended up getting some extra carriage returns in your results. The lines that you're seeing and don't expect to see, make 'em part of the previous line and you should be good!</p>

     <p>jb, of course I've heard of CSS and XHTML. Heck, I wrote a book about 'em. If you go back and read the code I present, it's certainly XHTML compliant.  In terms of using "deprecated" elements like 'target', I find that the newer ways of accomplishing these sort of capabilities are so clunky and awkward, that  I view it as typical committee-speak goofiness and ignore that it was deprecated.  Just because something is agreed upon by a committee doesn't mean it's an improvement!</p>

<p>For example, it may be "wrong" to use something like &lt;b&gt; but if you don't want to learn CSS styles, "span", etc etc., it's sure darn easy for people to learn and remember. What's more important anyway, that it be "right" according to some committee, or that it be usable?</p>

     <p>Hi Dave,</p>

<p>This is a great blog... thanks so much!</p>

<p>I am trying to use the Google Custom Search tool (http://www.google.com/coop/cse/).</p>

<p>The site I am doing this for (www.dawnnelson.org) is black, so I would like the results-page text to be white. </p>

<p>However, I need the query text to be black, because the box background is white.</p>

<p>I have looked through your blog post, but have not seen that topic discussed.</p>

<p>Can you please explain the best way to do this?</p>

<p>BTW, I had tried the AJAX version, but had the same problem with text color, so I reverted to the two-page version.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Josh</p>

     <p>Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I think by offering people the basics of coding then you don't scare them off, and therefore you give them the confidence to move forward and learn more.</p>

<p>There's no doubting that you're an intelligent guy, but you also possess a natural aptitude for teaching.<br />

     <p>Hi Dave,<br />
              This blog seems to be very helpful and hope my problem would be solved as well.I have pasted the code provided by you for the google search box in my site (http://dngc.tripod.com).<br />
              But the problem is that whenever I search anything within my site it doesn't searches all the pages rather it searches the index page only.I have used frames in the site,is that the reason for the problem.If it is then pliz provide me with a code so that it searches all the pages.</p>

     <p>You don't need google. The problem with google is that it index your site very randomly and not very often, so if you have a site which is very dynamic (i.e its contents change and new content is changed every now and then) then you need your own search tool as you want your users to get the latest results. The best that I have come across is Smart Spidey. It's the cheapest out there and works better than some of the most expensive search tool. It has a interesting Did you mean function and you can index your site anytime. Check it out at : <a href="http://www.smartspidey.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartspidey.com</a></p>

     <p>I know this is a few years old but THANKS. Was trying to solve this problem - had been using an icky widget for the past several weeks and had to look at GET WIDGET beneath it as a tradeoff - but this does the same thing, simply and more elegantly. On behalf of all of us who are BIG on content and SMALL on coding ability, thank you!!!!</p>

     <p>Dave,</p>

<p>I've been trying to add a google search box on my website, however, when I copy the code you provide into a page on my website it gives me an error that says Internet Explorer cannot display the page. I am using Dreamweaver and have the page setup in tables. If I copy the code into a blank page it works fine. What am I doing wrong?</p>

     <p>Hi, Dave,<br />
I would like to add code to a web page on my site that contains a single form input field. I would like site visitors to have the cursor go right to the entry for that input field.</p>

<p>I think I read about that a long time ago and I have spent a lot of time today trying to figure out how to describe the HTML coding question. I like your site and I think you have already described this somewhere but could not find it.</p>

<p>You can email me at my email address that I entered if you have the code for that.  And...THANKS for all the good help you have given; others have acknowledged the helpful info that you provide.</p>

<p>Signed  --  Ralph</p>

     <p>Is there a way to have a search for just one folder, for part of the site? <br />
Ok, here is what I am doing, I have piggybacked a personal/family history and photographs site onto my main site, where I enter the url for my site, then a / then the folder name where the second site is with a new index page...</p>

<p>This part has gotten unwieldy and would like it searchable...<br />
Is that possible? or is it un-google friendly?</p>

I have another question, why does the search engine list sites (database products) which a have deleted, in Google analytics that is shown as bad url, but the id number of the product (and product) doesn't exist in my database.</p>

     <p>Thanks a million! I had a good search box on my website once, but over time the code got messed up and it no longer worked. Also I think google changed their search box thing since then, so I can't make a new one (easily anyhow). This saved me! Thanks again, hope you don't mind that I modded it for my needs.</p>

How do i make the search box to search with a different search engine Not the Google search Engine and display the results on the same page and Not in a new window. <br />
In your code you have "<br />
" Can I replace the Action with different search eninges. You think this will work? or how do I make to search within our own search engine and within our  own site. <br />

thanks for all the help re:adding google search box to web site... BUT, what I really want to do is have a button that when clicked will submit a SPECIFIC querry to google from within my web page.<br />
I guess its the equivalent of replacing the querry box input mechanism with a predefined text string... how do I do that?  or... maybe just being able to pass parameters to google search... is any of this possible?</p>

     <p>This has been a massive help to me - been digging and thinking on this for months. My top tip to people would be to double check the scripting for typos when you amend it to your own website. Even though i copied and pasted, i still forgot to delete some bits when I added my own site details. it WILL and DOES work! If u have any probs, double check the script on your html page.<br />
This worked fine in Frontpage 2000.<br />
Thanx again!</p>

     <p>So happy that I found your site! Everytime I put Amazon in my search box [on my regular explorer page], it gets me to Amazon, then adds tons of letters to my search and it flips over to Google image search and cannot find what I'm looking for. Even though it just took me off the page that I wanted. This only seems to happen at sites where cookies are needed. I have done EVERYTHING suggested to enable cookies. I am on medium security as well. Why is google image search stuck on to my yahoo search bar? Help? Thank you in advance for understanding and helping.</p>

<p>Rather than having to load the Google Toolbar, is there a way I can simply replicate the Google search box on my intranet, ie Search the web with a check box option for the World or just the UK.</p>

<p>Can you advise what code I need?</p>

     <p>Great job, thanks for explaining how it works. You can also change language of the search in Google by changing the'action="http://www.google.com/search"</p>

<p>I needed Korean, so I changed it to 'action="http://www.google.co.kr/search"</p>

<p>Thanks<br />

     <p>Dave,</p>

<p>I successfully added the Google site search box. I have an unpublished storefront of about 7 pages. How do I modify your code so the search will only search specific pages that I identify, ie. my storefront pages only. I know I must have the pages indexed by Google before the search will work. Each page is sequential and are named like so: storefront, storefront2, storefront3, etc. Will I need some wild card code or will I need to repeat each page. To clarify which code I'm speaking of I have pasted it below(it has my domain name inside). Thanks, Lon </p>

<p> Search Site box</p>

<p>&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search"></p>

<p>&lt;div style="border:1px solid black;padding:4px;width:20em;"><br />
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0"><br />
&lt;tr>&lt;td><br />
&lt;input type="text"   name="q" size="25"<br />
 maxlength="255" value="" /><br />
&lt;input type="submit" value="Google Search" />&lt;/td>&lt;/tr><br />
&lt;tr>&lt;td align="center" style="font-size:75%"><br />
&lt;input type="checkbox"  name="sitesearch"<br />
 value="outdoor-photography-topic-gallery.com" checked /> only search </p>

<p>Outdoor Photography Topic Gallery&lt;br /><br />
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table><br />
&lt;/div></p>

<p>&lt;/form><br />

     <p>Gordon, add   target="_top"    to the FORM tag and it should do what you want. In other words:</p>

<p>&lt;form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search" target="_top" &gt;</p>

<p>That should do the trick!</p>

     <p>Hi Dave</p>

<p>I can't access Google Apps because my domain host suddenly is no more.  I am currently trying to find a new host for accommodationalbany.co.nz.</p>

<p>In the meantime, because Google Apps only applies to existing sites, I went to Google Sites and set up what I thought was a web page, fairviewheightsbb@gmail.com. I cant find it on the web. I think there is another step involved to attract search engines.  I am not familiar with HTML but does you advice about adding a google search box apply?. Do Google Sites attract search engines?  Do I need a host? <br />

I would like to add your code for this Google search but I was wondering if it is possible to not have the search web check option.  I want to only allow searches on my website.<br />
Is this possible and how can it be done.  Thanks for the code I have learnt a lot form your website.  <br />

     <p>Dear Dave,</p>

<p>Please help me understand what's wrong with my Google Search.</p>

<p>Google offers three alternatives, two of which work properly and the third one (the one that I need) - does not work at all.</p>

<p>1. search results in new window on Google site - works<br />
2. search results in current window on Google site - works<br />
3. search results in current window on page Search of my site - does not return results at all.</p>

<p>I am using iWeb widget to create SearchBox and SearchResults area.</p>

<p>Is it a problem of Apple's iWeb or is it a problem with Google code? Or am I a complete idiot?</p>

What the hell are you saying?? It's completely about the topic, coherent and logical!</p>

<p><br />
I have a Google search boX in my website, the first one Dave gave in the top of this page. It has two options, search The Web and Ask Dave Taylor with two input radio buttons before each one. You can chose which one you want to search. </p>

<p>Now I would like to know if this is possible and if it is how it's done: make the first option search the web only and the second option search google images only. Without having two different search boXes.</p>

<p><br />
How is that not related to the topic nor logical??</p>

     <p>Easy does it. I get a lot of comments and don't always recall why I do or don't moderate specific entries. Your question seems like a reasonable one and since the two use a very similar format, I expect it's doable too. </p>

<p>For example, here's a search URL:</p>

<p>    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=my+search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=my+search</a></p>

<p>and the same search on Google images:</p>

<p>   <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=my+search" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=my+search</a></p>

<p>So all you'd need to do is change the "action" field of the form if someone indicated they wanted to search images, not the full Google search. Let me poke around, see if I can come up with the necessary Javascript... :-)</p>

     <p>David, sounds like Google hasn't indexed your site yet. The easy way to find out is to search for your domain name prefaced by "site:" (I'd use "site:askdavetaylor.com" for example) and see if there are any matches. Then compare the total number of matches (you can find that in the top right) to the number of pages you know comprises your Web site.</p>

     <p>Hey Dave-<br />
Thanks for this script- it's slick.<br />
I have a problem... I just changed from a blogspot.com  to my own domain.  I put a robot.txt in my root folder to stop my old site from showing up in google searches.  I also did a mass url removal (per google crawler access)...<br />
here is my question... since I went from blogspot to my own domain, and I have blocked google from crawling my files by putting the robot.txt  in my root folder, am I now unable to have my own google search in my website?  Will these blocks affect my own personal site search?</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

     <p>Vikas, the benefit to using Google as a search engine is that it does all the work for you and you don't have to worry about a site-specific search engine and maintaining it locally...</p>

<p>Amy, you're right that if you are blocking Google from spidering your site by use of a robots.txt then this script will be useless to your visitors because it won't be able to search what you're not making available. You might check out <a href="http://www.lijit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lijit.com/</a> instead as a third-party blog search engine instead.</p>

<p>Thanks for the code, but can you tell me how place an image search button on the same page as a normal search button, I have tried myself but I can't seen to crack it. </p>

<p>Thanks, Sam</p>

     <p>Sam, not sure what you're asking. If you want *buttons* then you can easily have something pointing to images.google.com. If you want multiple search boxes, that's easy too, just make sure that you have each form (that produces the input area and button) end with the &lt;/form&gt; tag: many web site builders seem to be predicated on you having no more than one form on a page.</p>

     <p>Hi Dave: Please don't post my website in your public response. I am trying to add a search function using lotus notes (not my choice). We have a document library that is an https site. Ideally we'd like the search engine to go there.  When I write this code in lotus notes - it appears fine. But when I search either "the web" or internally, I get the following error: HTTP Web Server: Invalid URL Exception   -- can you explain why? And honestly, more importantly, how I can fix/work around this? Thank you! Scott</p>

     <p>Scott, I'm afraid I don't know enough about Lotus Notes to be able to assist. Seems like if you can create a search box on a blank page, though, you should be able to cut and paste that same code onto any page on your site.  Good luck!</p>

     <p>Dave, in your reply to John Kiester, you said " just needs to have target="new" added and it'll redirect the result of that form to a new window called "new"". If you always...."</p>

     <p>Mark, we're not tweaking the search results window, we're just ensuring that it shows up in a separate window, rather than the same one. I really can't imagine Google caring (or even having any control over it). I'm sure it's not a terms of service problem.</p>

and it does not work.  Is this an old suggestion now that Google charges to have an individual site search button? Wish it worked!! It just goes to the traditional google search page and you have to just enter what you want, no mention of my website..bummer!</p>

     <p>The first question to ask, Mary, is whether your site is in Google in the first place. If so, then try doing some searches like</p>

<p>    site:yourdomain.com test words</p>

<p>(where "yourdomain.com" is your actual domain). Do they work? Do you get results?  Then you should definitely be able to get the search box here to work.</p>

     <p>I just wanted to say thanks for the great tip on the HTML code for the Google Search Box.  I could have figured it out but this made it much easier.</p>

<p>Now I have it implemented on a custom start page for direct searches and to avoid their enlarged text and text box search page.</p>

     <p>Hi Dave, perhaps you can help me - I have added a Google custom search box to my homepage, and redirected the results to a page called /searchresults.aspx. When I try the search, it goes to the right page, but doesn't show any text at all.</p>

<p>If you are able to take a moment to look at the code, you will see the only difference there is to the code google issued me with is the "defer" command, which microsoft office live added itself.</p>

<p>This is exactly, well almost exactly but close enough to what I was looking for. Excellent, clean, short nice. The only improvement I did was to move the "search" button to the right of the text box. Sometimes when suggestions pop up they cover the search button.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this.</p>

     <p>Hi,<br />
Thank you for having this website and continuing to answer questions on this topic.  I have a google search box on my website and I am wondering if there is a way to have a hidden search term which will always be included in the search.  For example, if you wanted to always include the word "wiki" as a search term.  Is there a way to add this as a search term so that when a user types "puppies" it actually searches on "puppies wiki"?  Thanks.</p>

     <p>Hi Dave,<br />
I've seen you are not replying since months, so i hope you read this.<br />
What i'm missing with this searchbox are the google suggestions as you type. I find them so usefull that will make this searchbox unusable to me.<br />
Do you know how to achieve that ? btw, i just want to search the web from my site, not to search my site.<br />
Thanks for sharing what you know!<br />
Best<br />

     <p>Laneo, that's an interesting question: can you get Google search hints on a search box that is on your own site?  I have never seen anyone accomplish this and have never really dug into how it's done on the Google home page, but my instinct is that no, you can't do it. Perhaps someone else can show otherwise?</p>

     <p>Zal, what am I missing?  Just remove the border and drop the search button to below the input box and you have the same search box as that blogspot page?  Or are you sneakily trying to get us to visit your blog? :-)</p>

This is a problem because it needs to be user compatible. Is it right it just works on IE or have I dont something wrong?</p>

     <p>Hi Dave,</p>

<p>This is a great article and it is very useful, thank you.</p>

<p>I have a question, I would add the results in iframe without the google search box, can I do that? I just saw it in a blog and it is really nice, where our website header and footer still displayed and only google results displayed in the iframe.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help<br />

     <p>Khushboo, it shouldn't matter that your page is a .aspx page, as long as you can create a box of HTML that's not interpreted as ASP. I don't have a clue about that language, though, so I can't offer any suggestions.</p>

<p>Sam, look for line breaks within your HTML and make sure that every line that has an open "" all on the same line. That should help!</p>

     <p>Hi Dave,</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.<br />
These are the line  of codes I am implementing in my .aspx page i.e ASP.Net page.</p>

<p>[form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search" runat="server"]<br />
[input type="text"   name="q" size="31"<br />
 maxlength="255" value="" /]<br />
[input type="submit" value="Google Search" /]<br />
[input type="radio"  name="sitesearch" value="" /]<br />
[input type="radio"  name="sitesearch"<br />
 value="askdavetaylor.com" checked /] Ask Dave Taylor<br />
[/form]</p>

<p>If I remove runat="server" from the form tag it works fine, but if I put that its stops working, please tell me is there any solution that this code should work with "runat="server" in form tag as well.<br />
As I need to put this to make my other controls active.</p>

<p>Thanks..<br />

<p>I tried to add the "Google search" into my HTML editor (front page), but the only thing that shows up is the HTML code on your site.. I may be adding it to the wrong place in my html...I am not quite sure where in my coding I would paste your code...It is very confusing...I could email you my home page in html, but I am not sure that would be helpful... Any suggestions where to cut and paste your html code?? Before tags? after tags?  HELP???!!!!</p>

     <p>I've successfully added Dave Taylor's "How can I add a Google search box to my Web site?" html script to my page. </p>

<p>I'm wondering is it possible to do a google custom site search so it does my site and another...</p>

<p>Usage Example:</p>

<p>Option 1: Search "DELL AUSTRALIA"<br />
Option 2: Search "ALL DELL SITES" (USA, Germany, Japan etc)</p>

     <p>Dave,</p>

<p>THANKS for the great Google Search box!</p>

accessed again the background go completely white!</p>

<p>The only way to bring it back it to hit refesh?</p>

<p>I REALLY want this but my page disappears afterwards? Any Ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks Again !</p>

     <p>Hello Dave,<br />
I need to know how to add multiple search sites in menu and use only one text field to take the term.<br />
user choses the search engine, then inserts the search term, and finally presses the go button that will take him to the results page from that search engine.</p>

<p>thank you.</p>

     <p>Hi Dave, I have acquired a Google page that opens with "test" in the search box and a full page of articles with "test" within them.  I have tried to uninstall and even overinstall but now Google does not even appear in my list of programs.  Alss, my AOL page is truncated and I can only read a portion of the e-mail description.  This happened shortly before I installed Pareto File Cure and tried to install some of the "free" apps it said I needed. It was after this that I got the Google "test" search page.  I installed SoftSpy and heretofore, as now, I use a WinSock XP fix which has worked well to keep me clean until now.  Please help if you can.  Thanks!! Rebecca</p>

     <p>Hi Dave,</p>

<p>I really need your help in solving this problem.  </p>

<p>Google has always updated by website within 1 to 2 days of my making changes or adding content.</p>

<p>The last date they crawled my website was February 13th.  I made some changes on February 15th and now (no matter how many times I submit my url or use my submitter.net for submissions) no updating is occurring.</p>

<p>It seems as though Yahoo and Bing have updated my website and Google has updated other pages in my website EXCEPT for the Home Page.</p>

<p>What is happening?  I am starting to be concerned.</p>

<p>Alo, how do I get Google to use my description rather than other snippets they choose.  Sometimes, they just list my categories in the left navigation.</p>

<p>If you need my website address, please let me know.</p>

<p>I thank you in advance for any help you can give me.</p>

<p>Maggie</p>

<p></p>

     <p>Dave, I was able to place the google search function on my site however I seem to be having a problem. We need to search in Japanese. It seems that when I type in Japanese text and then hit "search" it defaults to ascii characters and not Japanese characters so the search fails. However, after the failure, if I *then* type in Japanese it works. If I type in English from the get-go it works.  I need for it to work in Japanese from the first step and not after it errors-out. Any ideas on what is going on and how I can fix the problem?<br />
thanks,<br />
