<BR> Microsoft Windows XP Home Upgrade operating system (service pack 2 installed, and latest updates)

<P>

<BR> Audigy 2 platinum drivers (November 2006)
<BR> NVIDIA drivers (November 2006) 93.71 version
<BR> Latest motherboard chipset drivers for ALI M1697

<P>

<BR> This computer really runs fast, I can run pretty much all my games, at 1920 x 1440 @ 60 Hz, and 4x antialiasing, 8x ansiotropic <BR> filtering(64 tap) or 16x ansiotropic filtering (128 tap), and maximum in game detail settings, with some games, I have to set <BR> antialiasing and ansiotropic filtering, to application preference, and set them in the game for some games. 

<BR> But now I use a LCD TV, instead of the high performance CRT I used to have which did 2048x1536, 1920x1440, and 1600x1200 at 32 <BR> bit, and 60-85Hz, I can only run at 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x720, 1360x768 on the PC, but the quality and size is simply amazing, <BR> and I can run games, almost twice as fast at 1360x768 and even faster at 1024x768, which also scales nicely, even 800x600 looks <BR> good.
