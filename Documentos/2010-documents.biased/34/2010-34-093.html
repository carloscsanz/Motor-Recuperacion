<p> Yup, the goal should be to work with a standard file format so anybody can use it.<p> Microsoft will then just have to compete by having the best products and quite frankly they have won. Especially with excel, their features and usability are far ahead of anything else. I love being able to open excel sheets in OpenOffice on my laptop (linux..so no Excel) without any weird formatting errors, but when creating complicated shit I far prefer the MS product. If only they could do as well with their other products...</p> </p>

<p> No, SUN was well aware that MS pulls tricks like this, they thought that they would be clever and they put in a requirement in the Java licenses to stick to the standard. Microsoft's Java system was stopped by an actual court decision. Unfortunately for SUN, it turned out that Microsoft had used their work with Java to learn and they created a Java copy called<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET. Basically a lesson. It is never worth cooperating with MS even if you think you are much cleverer than they are. </p>

Microsoft implemented a very buggy and incomplete version that killed Java's reputation, and Sun spent 4 years fighting Microsoft in court to kill the Microsoft JVM until they finally got it to <b>stop</b> shipping a JVM.

<p> I think you're interpreting the GP statement differently than I do because IIRC it's common for Microsoft to give better deals to those who seek alternatives to MS Office, and in many cases the organizations who say they're going with Open Standards (tm) end up with that sweet MS Office discount in the end. What the GP is pointing out is that he (and I) are hoping the Danish government is really routing for open standards but not using it just for leverage in price negotiations with Microsoft. </p>

<p> Wow! Touched a nerve with you didn't I? Fact is, I use and support M$ products every day at work. You know what? They suck. Especially after Office 2007 was born. All it really did was make the UI more confusing and bump up the price tag. Also, sir, if you think that adopting ODF does not mean they will switch to OpenOffice in the future, then you are an idiot. How does it benefit any government or organization to continue to pay for a product that they can get for free? </p>

<p> <p><p><i><p>What costs are saved by adopting this file format?</p></i></p><p>I think it's a fallacious argument from the start, anyway. Even if costs actually increase, ultimately, the openness of the file formats that government uses (at least in those cases where the documents can potentially be made available to the public, or where it's accepted formats of documents submitted to the government) is more important. Reason being, one can opt out from dealing with a private business that uses the "wrong format" for which you don't have means to work with it - but one cannot opt out from dealing with their government.</p><p>The cost saving issue is orthogonal to this, anyway, because deciding on the file format is not the same as deciding on the software (it's related, of course, because the latter can be affected by the former).
