<title>Former P.A. Semi chief leaves Apple for chip startup &#8211; report - Tech News Daily</title>

										&lt;p&gt;
										&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.A. Semi founder and chief executive Dan Dobberpuh, who joined Apple as part of the acquisition of his company two years ago, has since left the iPhone maker for a startup venture, according to a published report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
Though it has been unable the confirm the executive&#039;s departure with 100% certainty, &lt;em&gt;CNet News.com&lt;/em&gt; cited &quot;several sources&quot; Saturday who claim that Dobberpuhl &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10465618-64.html&quot;&gt;is no longer with Apple&lt;/a&gt; and that he made his exit sometime last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
Those same people told the publication that they believe Dobberpuhl has joined Amarjit Gill, a former principal at P.A. Semi, at Silicon Valley start-up &lt;a href=&quot;http://agnilux.com/&quot;&gt;Agnilux&lt;/a&gt;, based out in San Jose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
If true, Dobberpuhl&#039;s departure from Apple is the latest in a growing pool of former P.A. Semi engineers who&#039;ve submitted their papers since April of 2008, when Apple purchased the 150-employee chip design firm for $278 million in an effort to design proprietary chip technology for its mobile computing initiatives like the iPhone, iPod and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/technology/business-computing/02chip.html&quot;&gt;cited partial records&lt;/a&gt; on the job networking site LinkedIn in revealing that at least half a dozen former PA Semi engineers appear to have left Apple and turned up at Agnilux. The company was co-founded by one of P.A. Semis leading system architects, Mark Hayter, who also bid farewell to Apple shortly after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
&quot;Neither Mr. Hayter nor other onetime PA workers who left Apple for Agnilux were willing to discuss either companys plans,&quot; the newspaper reported. &quot;According to two people with knowledge of the two companies, who were unwilling to be named because the matter is delicate, some PA engineers left Apple a few months after the acquisition because they were given grants of Apple stock at an unattractive price.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
For its part, &lt;em&gt;CNet&lt;/em&gt; cited Linley Gwennap, president and principal analyst of The Linley Group, as suggesting that Dobberpuhl&#039;s departure -- and that of his peers -- may have been stemmed from a dramatic shift in the work environment that goes hand-and-hand with an Apple badge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#13;
&quot;He was the CEO at PA Semi and leader of the team, and one of the guys that was driving the whole thing,&quot; Gwennap said. But &quot;those guys are start-up kind of people, and within the structure of Apple, they may [have been] chafing.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<li><a href="http://www.tech-news-daily.info/nyt-steve-jobs-feels-google-betrayed-apple-by-mimicking-iphone.html" title="By Neil Hughes 										Published: 06:30 PM EST 										 										Apple co-founder Steve Jobs feels that Google "violated the alliance" it had with Apple when the search giant began producing cellphones that resemble the iPhone, according to a The New York Times piece that details the bitter rivalry between the two technology giants.&#13; In an extensive piece profiling the battle between Apple and Google, dubbed by one person as "World War III" due to the level of animosity involved, multiple sources told the Times that Jobs feels betrayed by Google.&#13; "We did not enter the search business. They entered the phone business," Jobs was quoted as saying at a company meeting. "Make no mistake; Google wants to kill the iPhone. We won't let them."&#13; The report also corroborated previous claims that Jobs used an expletive to dismiss Google's "don't be evil" mantra. The comment from the Apple co-founder reportedly earned "thunderous applause" from the company employees present at the meeting.&#13; The Times noted that Jobs seems to be "unusually emotional" in the battle with Google. It said the company's lawsuit against HTC portrayed Apple as "an aggrieved victim finally standing up to the playground bully."&#13; The report alleged that Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page considered Jobs a mentor, and were regular visitors to the company's Cupertino, Calif., campus. And while the relationship between Jobs and Google CEO Eric Schmidt was said to be pleasant, the two were reportedly "never close friends."&#13; Relations between the two companies allegedly turned sour when the Android mobile operating system was first introduced. A series of heated meetings between Apple and Google executives took place soon after.&#13; "Many of those meetings turned confrontational, according to people familiar with the discussions, with Mr. Jobs often accusing Google of stealing iPhone features," the report said. "Google executives said that Androids features were based on longstanding ideas already circulating in the industry and that some Android prototypes predated the iPhone."&#13; "At one particularly heated meeting in 2008 on Googles campus, Mr. Jobs angrily told Google executives that if they deployed a version of multitouch  the popular iPhone feature that allows users to control their devices with flicks of their fingers  he would sue. Two people briefed on the meeting described it as 'fierce' and 'heated.'"&#13; It was the introduction of Android, the Chrome browser, and Google's plans to release its own netbook operating system that forced Schmidt off of Apple's board of directors last August. It was soon after that the two began competing for acquisitions.&#13; While it was previously known that Apple talked with AdMob about a potential acquisition, the Times revealed more details on the talks:&#13; "While Apple conducted due diligence on the deal, AdMob agreed to a 45-day 'no shop' provision, a routine clause that prevented the start-up from offering itself for sale to others, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. But after Apple inexplicably let 45 days pass without consummating its offer, Google pounced."&#13; Google purchased AdMob for $750 million three days after the "no shop" provision with Apple expired. One executive told the Times that Google was willing to pay the premium just to keep the company away from Apple. Soon after the deal was struck, Apple responded by acquiring competing mobile ad firm Quattro Wireless.&#13; The report even mentions the persistent rumors that Apple could partner with Microsoft to make Bing the default search engine and maps provider for the iPhone. As usual, Apple declined to comment on anything for the story.&#13; "And it would present an unlikely sight: Steve Jobs and Apple, running from the arms of Eric Schmidt and Google, into the embrace of Steve Ballmer and Microsoft," the report concluded.">NYT: Steve Jobs feels Google betrayed Apple by mimicking iPhone</a> (March 13th, 2010)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tech-news-daily.info/apple-to-replace-ipads-in-need-of-new-battery-for-99.html" title="By Slash Lane 										Published: 02:30 PM EST 										 										Apple said this week that it will offer a Battery Replacement Service for its new iPad tablet that is similar to the one offered for iPhones and iPods, only this time the company plans to replace the entire device rather than swap out its depleted battery.&#13; "If your iPad requires service due to the batterys diminished ability to hold an electrical charge, Apple will replace your iPad for a service fee," the company said in a support document posted to its website. It added that data will not be preserved on iPads needing service because owners will "receive  a replacement iPad that will not contain any of your personal data."&#13; The service will costs $99, plus $6.95 shipping, for a pre-tax total of $105.95 per unit. Apple estimates that it will take approximately one week from the time owners send in their iPad till they receive their replacement device. &#13; "Before you submit your iPad for service, it is important to sync your iPad with iTunes to back up your contacts, calendars, email account settings, bookmarks, apps, etc," the company said.

<li><a href="http://www.tech-news-daily.info/roughly-10-of-microsoft-employees-said-to-be-iphone-owners.html" title="By Sam Oliver 										Published: 12:50 PM EST 										 										Although it's no secret that members of Microsoft's leadership frown upon employees who choose an Apple iPhone over one running the company's own Windows Mobile operating system, approximately 1 in 10 still veer towards the forbidden fruit and sometimes go to great lengths to conceal them on the job.&#13; In a lengthy profile on the perils of being an iPhone user at Microsoft, The Wall Street Journal cites two people familiar with the matter in saying that nearly 10,000 iPhone users were regularly accessing the Microsoft employee email system last year, representing roughly 10% of the company's global headcount.&#13; The trend at Microsoft has flourished in the face of chief executive Steve Ballmer, who has a long track record of making inflammatory remarks about the Apple handset and expressing his displeasure with staffers who use one. Perhaps the most infamous example of this came last September during a private company meeting when he caught an employee using an iPhone to snap a photo of his entrance.&#13; Ballmer grabbed the iPhone from the employee, made some remarks as the crowd booed, then placed it on the ground and pretended to stomp on it before walking away. During his ensuing presentation, the Microsoft chief again turned his attention to the employee with a few more teasing remarks. &#13; In yet another sign that Microsoft was determined to curb iPhone adoption amongst its own kind, the Journal notes that the company "in early 2009 modified its corporate cellphone policy to only reimburse service fees for employees using phones that run on Windows Phone software." The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant would later claim the move was "part of a broader cost-cutting plan."&#13; Still, many employees are unwilling to sacrifice their iPhone and regularly adopt measures to hide their handsets when in the presence of the company's top brass, according to the Journal. "While rank-and-file workers tend to use the iPhone openly around peers, some conceal them within sight of more senior executives.," the paper reports. "One Microsoft worker said he knows several colleagues who try to disguise their iPhones with cases that make them look more like generic handsets."&#13; &#13; "Maybe once a year I'm in a meeting with Steve Ballmer," that employee said. "It doesn't matter who's calling, I'm not answering my phone."">Roughly 10% of Microsoft employees said to be iPhone owners</a> (March 13th, 2010)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tech-news-daily.info/apple-coo-tim-cook-awarded-22-million-bonus.html" title="By Slash Lane 										Published: 05:00 PM EST 										 										Apple said Friday that Chief Operating Office Tim Cook was awarded nearly 22 million in stock- and cash-based compensation for his performance running the company during Steve Jobs' absence last year.&#13; In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the iPhone maker said its Board of Directors unanimously approved the recommendation by Jobs to award Cook a one-time discretionary bonus of $5,000,000 in addition to 75,000 restricted stock units "in recognition of his outstanding performance in assuming the day-to-day operations of the company" when Jobs was on medical leave of absence.&#13; Cook assumed the role of interim Apple CEO from January to June of 2009 so that Jobs could recover from liver transplant surgery. During that time, he oversaw the launch of several key products, most notably the iPhone 3GS.&#13; At today's market value, Cook's 75,000 restricted stock units are worth $16,995,000, bringing the total current value of his compensation bonus to roughly $21,995,000. Fifty percent of the restricted stock units are scheduled to vest on each of March 10, 2011 and March 10, 2012, subject to Cook's continued employment with the company, Apple said.&#13; The move underscores how valuable Apple considers Cook to its continued success. He was first lured to the company by Jobs in 1998 and since then has emerged as one of the stars of the Apple's management team, making him the the subject of overtures from some of the industry's biggest names, including Dell and Motorola. &#13; &#13; It's widely expressed amongst Apple circles that Cook has long been groomed to succeed Jobs in leading the company should the co-founder ever have to step down. For more on Cook, see AppleInsider's recent profile.">Apple COO Tim Cook awarded $22 million bonus</a> (March 12th, 2010)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tech-news-daily.info/ipad-50000-sales-in-2-hours-apple-tv-bumped-mysterious-app-icon.html" title="By Slash Lane 										Published: 02:00 PM EST 										 										The introduction of the iPad Friday morning sold an estimated 50,000 units in two hours, and also bumped Apple's "hobby," the Apple TV, from the front page of its online store. Also, a mysterious icon included in iPad promotional pictures gains attention, and Apple has expanded its site to explain features of the coming hardware in greater detail.&#13; iPad sales estimated at 25,000 per hour&#13; After it went on sale at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Friday, the iPad is estimated to have sold 51,000 in its first two hours. As discovered by Philip Elmer-DeWitt at Fortune Brainstorm Tech, users at the Investor Village AAPL Sanity Board took their order numbers and attempted to crack the code to figure out total sales.&#13; Victor Castroll, analyst with Valcent Financial Group and member of the AAPL Sanity Board, has been monitoring the spreadsheet and came up with the calculation of 51,000 units in the first two hours.&#13; iPad preorder bumps Apple TV from front page of online store&#13; In accepting preorders for the iPad on Friday, Apple made some minor adjustments to the front page of its online store. As a result, the Apple TV product and its accompanying picture were bumped and are no longer featured atop the store's main page.&#13; The Apple TV used to be featured prominently alongside the company's line iPods, the iPhone and Macs. Now users must scroll down and find it in the left column under the "For iPod" heading.&#13; Last month, Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook said his company still views the Apple TV as a "hobby," and noted that sales of the product simply don't compare to the consumer markets for smartphones, computers and MP3 players. Cook said he doesn't believe the Apple TV will remain dormant, but it may take time for the potential market for the device to grow.&#13; "Because our gut says something is there, we're continuing to invest in this," Cook said. "But today, it's still just a hobby."&#13; Last October, Apple released the 3.0 software update for Apple TV, featuring a redesigned main menu that made navigating content simpler and faster. It also added support for the new iTunes LP and iTunes Extras formats.&#13; &#13; Mysterious app icon gains attention&#13; Apple updated its Web site with new pictures of the iPad Friday, and one screenshot in particular garnered attention from readers due to its inclusion of a mysterious icon. Included on the home screen Web page, the picture shows an icon on the far right of the device in landscape mode, and the application is not shown in any other screenshots.&#13; Though the text is too small to read clearly, the icon appears to show the logo for the publication National Geographic. It's likely that the icon is for a digital version of the magazine, to be sold through Apple's iBookstore.&#13; &#13; Apple expands on iPad features&#13; As preorders began Friday, Apple also fleshed out the official iPad section of its Web site, adding greater detail on the iBooks application, 3G data subscriptions with AT&amp;T, and more.&#13; As before, all of the built-in applications on the iPad have their own page describing their function. Apple also has special dedicated pages for the iBooks application, which must be downloaded from the App Store, as well as the $9.99 Keynote, Pages and Numbers software.&#13; A page devoted to 3G access on the iPad describes how users can start and cancel a no-contract data plan with AT&amp;T direct from the device at any time. As was revealed at the product's unveiling, the data plans run $15 per month for 250MB of data, or $30 per month for unlimited access.&#13; &#13; Apple also updated its total number of applications available on the App Store to 150,000. When the iPad was first announced, the company advertised that more than 140,000 applications would be available for the device at launch.">iPad: 50,000 sales in 2 hours, Apple TV bumped, mysterious app icon</a> (March 12th, 2010)</li>
