<h1>Information retrieval</h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=information_retrieval&action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a><br/><br/><!-- content begin -->
<strong>Information retrieval</strong> (<strong>IR</strong>) is the science of searching for documents, for <a href='/article/information' title='View page:information'>information</a> within documents, and for <a href='/article/Metadata_%28computing%29' title='View page:Metadata_%28computing%29'>metadata</a> about documents, as well as that of searching relational databases and the <a href='/article/World_Wide_Web' title='View page:World_Wide_Web'>World Wide Web</a>. There is overlap in the usage of the terms <a href='/article/Computer_data' title='View page:Computer_data'>data</a> retrieval, document retrieval, information retrieval, and text retrieval, but each also has its own body of literature, theory, <a href='/article/Praxis_%28process%29' title='View page:Praxis_%28process%29'>praxis</a>, and technologies.  IR is interdisciplinary, based on <a href='/article/computer_science' title='View page:computer_science'>computer science</a>, <a href='/article/mathematics' title='View page:mathematics'>mathematics</a>, library science, information science, information architecture, cognitive psychology, <a href='/article/linguistics' title='View page:linguistics'>linguistics</a>, <a href='/article/statistics' title='View page:statistics'>statistics</a>, and physics.
<p>
Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called "<a href='/article/information_overload' title='View page:information_overload'>information overload</a>". Many universities and <a href='/article/public_library' title='View page:public_library'>public libraries</a> use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. Web search engines are the most visible <a href='/article/Information_retrieval_applications' title='View page:Information_retrieval_applications'>IR applications</a>.
<p>
<a name="History"><h2>History</h2></a>
<p>
The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article <em><a href='/article/As_We_May_Think' title='View page:As_We_May_Think'>As We May Think</a></em> by Vannevar Bush in 1945.<ref name="Singhal2001"></ref> The first automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s. By 1970 several different techniques had been shown to perform well on small <a href='/article/text_corpora' title='View page:text_corpora'>text corpora</a> such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).<ref name="Singhal2001" />. Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.
<p>
In 1992 the US Department of Defense, along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that scale to huge corpora. The introduction of web <a href='/article/Web_search_engine' title='View page:Web_search_engine'>search engine</a>s has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.
<p>
The use of digital methods for storing and retrieving information has led to the phenomenon of digital obsolescence, where a digital resource ceases to be readable because the physical media, the reader required to read the media, the hardware, or the software that runs on it, is no longer available. The information is initially easier to retrieve than if it were on paper, but is then effectively lost.

<a name="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.
<p>
An object is an entity that is represented by information in a database. User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the <a href='/article/Information_retrieval_applications' title='View page:Information_retrieval_applications'>application</a> the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.
<p>
Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.<ref name="Frakes1992"></ref>
<p>
<a name="Performance measures"><h2>Performance measures</h2></a>
<p>
Many different measures for evaluating the performance of information retrieval systems have been proposed. The measures require a collection of documents and a query. All common measures described here assume a ground truth notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice queries may be <a href='/article/ill-posed' title='View page:ill-posed'>ill-posed</a> and there may be different shades of relevancy.
<p>
<a name="Precision"><h3>Precision</h3></a>
<p>
Precision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.
<p>
:<math> mbox{precision}=frac{|{mbox{relevant documents}}cap{mbox{retrieved documents}}|}{|{mbox{retrieved documents}}|} </math>
<p>
In <a href='/article/binary_classification' title='View page:binary_classification'>binary classification</a>, precision is analogous to <a href='/article/positive_predictive_value' title='View page:positive_predictive_value'>positive predictive value</a>. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called <em>precision at n</em> or <em>P@n</em>.
<p>
Note that the meaning and usage of "precision" in the field of Information Retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and technology.
<p>
<a name="Recall"><h3>Recall</h3></a>
<p>
Recall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved.
<p>
:<math>mbox{recall}=frac{|{mbox{relevant documents}}cap{mbox{retrieved documents}}|}{|{mbox{relevant documents}}|} </math>
<p>
In binary classification, recall is called <a href='/article/sensitivity_%28tests%29' title='View page:sensitivity_%28tests%29'>sensitivity</a>. So it can be looked at as <em>the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query</em>.
<p>
It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.
<p>
<a name="Fall-Out"><h3>Fall-Out</h3></a>
The proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:
<p>
:<math> mbox{fall-out}=frac{|{mbox{non-relevant documents}}cap{mbox{retrieved documents}}|}{|{mbox{non-relevant documents}}|} </math>
<p>
In binary classification, fall-out is closely related to <a href='/article/specificity_%28tests%29' title='View page:specificity_%28tests%29'>specificity</a> <math>(1-mbox{specificity})</math>. It can be looked at as <em>the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query</em>.
<p>
It is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.
<p>
<a name="F-measure"><h3>F-measure</h3></a>
<p>
The weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:
<p>
:<math>F = frac{2 cdot mathrm{precision} cdot mathrm{recall}}{(mathrm{precision} + mathrm{recall})}.,</math>
<p>
This is also known as the <math>F_1</math> measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.
<p>
The general formula for non-negative real β is:
:<math>F_beta = frac{(1 + beta<sup>2) cdot (mathrm{precision} cdot mathrm{recall})}{(beta</sup>2 cdot mathrm{precision} + mathrm{recall})},</math>.
<p>
Two other commonly used F measures are the <math>F_{2}</math> measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the <math>F_{0.5}</math> measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.
<p>
The F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that <math>F_beta</math> "measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches β times as much importance to recall as precision".  It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure <math>E = 1-(1/(alpha/P + (1-alpha)<em>R))</math>.  Their relationship is <math>F_beta = 1 - E</math> where <math>alpha=1</em>(beta^2+1)</math>.
<p>
<a name="Mean Average precision"><h3>Mean Average precision</h3></a>
<p>
Precision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. Average precision emphasizes ranking relevant documents higher. It is the average of precisions computed at the point of each of the relevant documents in the ranked sequence:
<p>
:<math> operatorname{AveP} = frac{sum_{r=1}^N (P(r) times mathrm{rel}(r))}{mbox{number of relevant documents}} !</math> 
<p>
<!-- It <em>should</em> be P@r instead of P(r), but couldn't find the right way to do that -->
<p>
where <em>r</em> is the rank, <em>N</em> the number retrieved, <em>rel()</em> a binary function on the relevance of a given rank, and <em>P(r)</em> precision at a given cut-off rank:
<p>
:<math> mbox{P(r)} = frac{|{mbox{relevant retrieved documents of rank r or less}}|}{r} </math>
<p>
This metric is also sometimes referred to geometrically as the area under the Precision-Recall curve.
<p>
Note that the denominator (number of relevant documents) is the number of relevant documents in the entire collection, so that the metric reflects performance over all relevant documents, regardless of a retrieval cutoff. See: <ref name="Turpin2006"></ref>.

, original source <a href="http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&lng=eng&id=">&raquo;Dominik Kuropka</a>).]]
For the information retrieval to be efficient, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. There are several representations. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.
<p>
<a name="First dimension: mathematical basis"><h3>First dimension: mathematical basis</h3></a>
<ul><li> <em>Set-theoretic models</em> represent documents as sets of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:
<ul><li> <a href='/article/Standard_Boolean_model' title='View page:Standard_Boolean_model'>Standard Boolean model</a>
<li> <a href='/article/Extended_Boolean_model' title='View page:Extended_Boolean_model'>Extended Boolean model</a>
<li> Fuzzy retrieval</ul>
<li> <em>Algebraic models</em> represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.
<ul><li> Vector space model
<li> <a href='/article/Generalized_vector_space_model' title='View page:Generalized_vector_space_model'>Generalized vector space model</a>
<li>  (Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model

<li> <a href='/article/Latent_semantic_indexing' title='View page:Latent_semantic_indexing'>Latent semantic indexing</a> aka latent semantic analysis</ul>
<li> <em>Probabilistic models</em> treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like the <a href='/article/Bayes%27_theorem' title='View page:Bayes%27_theorem'>Bayes' theorem</a> are often used in these models.
<ul><li> Binary Independence Model
<li> Probabilistic relevance model on which is based the <a href='/article/Probabilistic_relevance_model_%28BM25%29' title='View page:Probabilistic_relevance_model_%28BM25%29'>okapi (BM25)</a> relevance function

<li> Latent Dirichlet allocation</ul>
<li> <em>Machine-learned ranking</em> models view documents as vectors of ranking features (some of which often incorporate other ranking models mentioned above) and try to find the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score by <a href='/article/machine_learning' title='View page:machine_learning'>machine learning</a> methods.</ul>
<p>
<a name="Second dimension: properties of the model"><h3>Second dimension: properties of the model</h3></a>
<ul><li> <em>Models without term-interdependencies</em> treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the <a href='/article/orthogonality' title='View page:orthogonality'>orthogonality</a> assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term variables.
<li> <em>Models with immanent term interdependencies</em> allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by <a href='/article/dimension_reduction' title='View page:dimension_reduction'>dimensional reduction</a>) from the <a href='/article/co-occurrence' title='View page:co-occurrence'>co-occurrence</a> of those terms in the whole set of documents.
<li> <em>Models with transcendent term interdependencies</em> allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They relay an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example a human or sophisticated algorithms.)</ul>
