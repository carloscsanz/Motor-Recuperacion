                Last year, Spike TV�s VGAs were a comedy of errors.  Or maybe that should be horrors.  32 was so traumatized by last year�s show, he actually couldn�t do a coherent piece on just the show.

I was initially going to be joined by my good friend LoBue, but he was too shaken up after seeing a woman lick a pineapple earlier on today.  (And I bet you think I�m making that up.)  So tonight it will just be me, surviving on my wits, my voluminous hatred for all of humanity, and a massive helping of Liquid Taco (patented by my good friend from college, Kendra).                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                                        Just to review, we had a grand total of one award won by a truly worthy nominee, although there was a smattering of arguable winners.  Moreover, as fitting a network that somehow manages to foul up a translation of Takeshi�s Castle, blatant racism won the day as only one non-American company managed to win a single award (NCSoft, take a bow).  The lesson is as always � nobody got poor or unheralded for underestimating the intelligence of the American people.  And as an added bonus, pandering to idiots will paper over any number of labor abuses thanks to awards shows.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                                        Was it better than last year�s show?  Yes.  But then again, trepanning without anesthesia was better than last year�s show.  This year�s show was dreck, but at least it wasn�t insulting my intelligence at all times.  Just half of them.  I just hope that I�m the only one who watched this � maybe in the future, Spike will leave such awards to people who actually know games, and not just people with conflicting allegiances.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
