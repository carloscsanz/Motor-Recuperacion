                There are a few things in life that are true.  Fish must swim.  Birds must fly.  And 32_Footsteps has to put himself through the annual torture fest called the Spike TV Video Game Awards and pay close attention to it.  There�s something therapeutic about rampant hatred, after all.  If you want to see how he reacted last year, click <a href=http://www.netjak.com/review.php/1069>here</a>.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>9:41</b> � Welcome from Casa del Footsteps in chilly Somerville, MA.  It�s just 19 minutes from the worst two hours of my year � the Spike TV Video Game Awards.  It was actually filmed last Friday, so I�ve already got a list of winners and warnings about what to suspect.  But as we already have all that, and Joystiq�s from-the-floor coverage, why am I putting myself through this?  Because I want to see a good video game awards show � and we�re not going to get one unless I rip apart a bad one every opportunity I get.  And since my cable provider doesn�t carry G4, G-phoria is safe from this kind of coverage.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    Before we begin, I�d like to note that this year, in a remarkable shift from last year; every single game nominated for anything has actually been released before the show airs.  However, if they handled the voting like a year ago, it actually closed a month ago.  Thus, the PlayStation 3, the Wii, and Wii Sports were not out when voting probably ended.  Among other nominees, Final Fantasy XII, Gears of War, and Valkyrie Profile: Silmeria had been out for a couple of weeks at most.  Just in case, you know, you had any illusions that the people behind Spike had a chance to give these games a spin before voting on them.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>9:42</b> - Instead of a pre-show like in previous years, they�re just showing Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Man, this show has fallen in esteem even at Spike.  The first one was hyped to oblivion.  There were even ads in major cities� transit systems.  The second year had lots of commercials.  Last year, they mostly sent out press releases and that�s it.  This year?  I had to hunt down on their website when the show was.  I�m expecting next year�s show at 3 AM on Monday morning next year.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>9:53</b> � In a surprisingly and refreshingly subdued promo for the show, they brag about having exclusive footage from the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion, Burning Crusade.  Look, I know television networks are trying their hardest to deny the existence of YouTube, which has had the footage for a few days now.  But at what point do you start wondering about �truth in advertising�?                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>9:56</b> � They just showed an ad for Dead or Alive Extreme 2.  Did I miss something, or wasn�t that supposed to be a fighting game, not a �stare at full-motion video of polygonal women in bikinis� game?                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>9:59</b> � Is that blood I smell?                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:01</b> � We�re spared an introduction and go straight into Tenacious D�s performance.  Jack Black looks surprisingly alert and attentive � I suppose he�s waiting until after the show to smoke up.  Either that, or the flame jets have some really interesting fuel.  Right now, they�re doing a song about how �metal� will reign supreme and live forever.  I�m half-tempted to call up Harmonix right now and ask if they�re watching � Tenacious D is obviously auditioning for Guitar Hero 3 as we speak.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:04</b> � Damn, couldn�t be so lucky to get no introduction.  Now I get to watch as Spike proves they have no design sense whatsoever.  Hilariously, the team behind the logos is called the �Spike Creative Group�.  I never knew Spike TV was that Orwellian.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:06</b> � Wow � how many video game clich�s can they pack into one opening sketch?  All your base, �In your base, killin� your dudes,� Okami (with a dog humping a leg), PS3 lines, a lack of toilets in a role-playing game... this sounds like the same jokes I would have made if I was 12 and playing these games for the first time.  Though I don�t know if I would have thrown in an Abu Ghraib joke back then.  Anyhow, Samuel L. Jackson comes on stage firing really fake laser blasts at a bunch of people playing Kansas� �Carry on Wayward Son� on GH2 � but if they were playing Bang Camaro�s �Push Push,� his B-movie behind would be kicked in so hard, they�d have to cancel the show.  Memo to self � make sure Bang Camaro shows up next year to help me cancel the VGAs.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:09</b> � The voice of Stewie Griffin just called Samuel L. Jackson a �gaming god.�  Well, guess I�m atheist now.  And you�d think someone a little more involved in gaming, like Miyamoto, would get called that.  In the opening dialogue before the crowd, he claims he has a PS4 with a vagina.  Boy, I�m glad I wasn�t using that self-respect.  I�m just disturbed by the fact that Samuel L. Jackson would willingly stick a sexual organ into something Sony made.  They�ve got bad crashing problems.  He also talks about how online gaming is a boon to online pedophiles.  Is he trying to convince gamers to not go online, lest they get arrested?  He follows by saying how gamers are getting Wii elbow instead of beat-off elbow � because we all know that gamers� only sexual outlet is masturbation.  He somehow manages to find a funny, or at least not horrible, joke about cell phone games causing accidents.  He finishes up the opening monologue by talking about how Tiger Woods PGA Tour �07 is so realistic, the courses are racist.  All in all, we get one passably funny moment in a two-minute monologue that would shame Jay Leno with its lame lack of jokes.  Well, that sets the tone for the night � the Spike TV VGAs are in classic form already.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:11</b> � He wants to end unfair VG stereotypes?  After that opening monologue?  How about you cancel the show?  While it�s obvious they just picked up the cheapest actors they could find to act out these stereotypes, at least they�re willing to suggest, even jokingly, that we gamers can get married just fine.  They actually show cosplayers� which is really odd, because I didn�t think this would be the Spike TV Anime Awards.  But to their credit (gasp and shock!), they suggest that cosplayers are normal individuals who are active in the community.  Fact is, I know some cosplayers, and they generally are active as such.  I�m in some alternate dimension where Spike makes sense.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:13</b> � 50 Cent comes out to present the first award, for the Best Female Performance in a video game.  He stutters, and then goes to proceed to the nominees.  My guess as to the stutter was him seeing a stupid joke on the teleprompter, and tripping over himself to not say it.  Happens to the best of us.  Vida Guerra takes the prize for her work on Scarface � and if anyone actually remembered it, that might say something.  She thankfully keeps her speech short and sweet, simply thanking everyone for voting.  Spike thankfully has apparently brought back the one good thing from the first show � short thanks at best.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:16</b> � After the announcement of the World of Warcraft preview, Stewie says �hear that America?  That�s the sound of a million nerds getting boners.�  Coincidentally, the audience was pretty quiet and looking bored on television.  So the sound of a million of us getting turned on at once is passive boredom?  I�m trying to figure out if Spike TV is just the most post-modern take on bad jokes in history, or if they just have the worst timing.  I�ll go with the latter.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:20</b> � Stewie taunts Jackson by saying he won�t ever see Snakes on a Plane � and Sam counters with �I will hit a baby.�  You know what says a grand old time of video game playing?  Child abuse.  Yep.  By the way, I feel my soul shriveling into a hidden part of my being, hiding from the torture my mind is undergoing right now.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:21</b> � Rachel Leigh Cook and Seth Green come out to present for best game based on a movie or television show.  They say they want to apologize for Hollywood movies based on games � throwing out there both Mortal Kombat movies, Street Fighter, most of Uwe Boll�s work (though thankfully not mentioning him by name), and a few others.  It�s oddly refreshing.  Now all they have to do is apologize for this category, which has at most one good game in it per year � proved by the fact that the Family Guy game, which even Family Guy fans hate, is nominated.  At least Lego Star Wars II, the one that was good, won.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:24</b> � Someone from LucasArts accepts � he actually brings a list of people to thank.  I wonder how long it�ll be before Spike starts their own �get off the freaking stage� music thanks to this guy.  His �thanks� speech proves that Lucas� employees make more things than just Star Wars movies excessively long and dull.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:25</b> � Daniel Day Kim from Lost is here?  To present a preview for Bioshock?  Why, did he piss off an executive at ABC?  Anyhow, the game looks like a cross between Silent Hill and Half-Life.  Interesting.  Now if they can have a scene in which the walls suddenly start bleeding and you hear a radio crackling as monsters approach you, I�ll be on board with it.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:26</b> � Maria Menoudos is back � wearing something much less revealing than last year.  Odds of her appearing in next year�s broadcast � dropping rapidly.  Wait a moment; did she call the mo-cap guys the �blood and guts of the video game industry�?  Even as a joke, that�s too dumb for words.  This is followed by a mock interview with a fat guy in a pseudo-mo-cap suit, pretending to be �the bitch� for Saint�s Row.  I haven�t had anything to eat in the last 12 hours beyond a bowl of pasta, and I want to throw up five gallons of vomit.  I have to wonder what it says about Spike that they get a hot woman like Maria to come out, and then immediately subject us to a fat guy pretending to be violated by another man.  I think they want to try to get as many men as possible to have an erection while looking at this kind of thing.  Are they trying to condition me to hate hot women here?                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:33</b> � Seth MacFarlane comes out with Tila Tequila.  They make a few lame jokes about the girth of Seth�s cell phone � reminding me simultaneously why I can�t stand MySpace and Family Guy.  They show the award for Best Wireless Game � AKA, best game for people too cheap to buy both a cell phone and either a PSP or a DS.  What�s next, Spike is going to have an award for best game that came for free with Windows?  Anyhow, SWAT Force from Vivendi wins.  Dozens of cell phone gamers are ecstatic, I�m sure.  By the way, that was actually presented live, instead of an award we might care about, which we�ll get to later.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    <b>10:35</b> � We now get jokes from Jackson about video game violence � specifically, violence against games by girlfriends.  Thanks Sam � this fulfills the mandated �two minutes of sexist drivel� that must appear on every single Spike show.  In order to explain why women �hate� games, he says he�s �a real scientist� and that only men have the �awesome lobe� to appreciate video games.  Jackson also claims women just want to interrupt people playing games just to hurt a gamer�s fun.  I know plenty of female gamers who�d castrate him with a Wiimote for making that joke.  It�s so wrong that I�m just in shock it was even made.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best Fighting Game � Mortal Kombat Armageddon.  I�ve never liked the Mortal Kombat games � the gameplay has never been there.  But you want to know how sorry this category was?  Street Fighter Alpha Anthology was nominated.  When a repackaging of three games, the youngest being no less than six years old, is nominated to fill out the ranks, the genre had an incredibly bad year.

                    Best Shooter � Gears of War.  The only question I have here is, why not just call it the Best FPS category?  Nobody, at all, calls the genre �shooters�.

                    Best Graphics � Gears of War.  Look, they were really detailed shades of brown and grey, with blood splatters.  But seriously, no game�s graphics blew people away like Okami�s did.  Even I, the guy who generally ignores graphics, had his breath taken away by that game.  Even though I didn�t think much of the game itself, only a fool would deny Okami�s graphical greatness.

                    Best Handheld Game � New Super Mario Bros.  Excuse me?  Did you just hear the familiar theme and give it out automatically?  If anything, it was a step backwards for the series in just about every way.  In a year where we got Children of Mana, Final Fantasy 3, and several others of that ilk, you give it to NSMB?

                    Best RPG � Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.  Well, at least they didn�t give it out to the two Square-Enix games that the voters didn�t get to play before voting probably ended.  Still, I�m disappointed Atelier Iris 2 wasn�t even considered.  Oh, right, that had pixels, it never would have won.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best PC game � Company of Heroes.

My mom did stay up and said that Aerosmith still didn�t come on for another hour.

The former is predictable from when any company gets a gaming personality, however lame, to present for a game.  The latter was just predictable because Spike TV likes the image of muscular guys threatening twiggy guys.  Brings me back to high school.

It might seem odd at first that they�d actually present Supporting Male during the show, but the more-important Male Performance is done on the side real quick.  Of course, then you remember that Patrick Stewart is, on top of being a great actor, a smart man who wouldn�t be caught dead dealing with Spike TV in an awards ceremony.  So he gets shunted.  And for the record, nobody was even close to matching him.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best Supporting Female � Rachel Leigh Cook, Kingdom Hearts 2.  What does it say that I had to look up what she even did in the game?  And then when I did, I couldn�t remember how she did it for the life of me?  The correct answer is, �she wasn�t nearly important enough to win an award for it.�                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best Soundtrack � Guitar Hero 2.  Damn skippy, it had the best soundtrack.  It�s worth noting that for the first time since Tenacious D was on stage, I heard significant cheering from the audience when this was announced.  Even Spike�s stupidity can�t stand before the greatness that is the GH2 soundtrack.  Now only if it were commercially available on CD�                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best Breakthrough Technology � Nintendo Wii.  Well, of all the nominees, it was the only actual breakthrough (somehow, the DS Lite was nominated.  How can a slightly smaller version of the same hardware be a breakthrough?).  So I suppose it almost won by default.  However, I must say I�m shocked that the Sony fanboyism that usually rules the day at Spike was thrown to the side.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Best Action Game � Dead Rising.  I�m actually worried for the future of this category.  Dead Rising was the only real choice to make this year.  But given the competition against it, which included New Super Mario Bros. and Okami, I think it�s indicative that the genre is slipping fast.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    <b>11:28</b> � Jackson talks about new consoles, and what to do with old consoles.  He says Spike is here to help.  Does he suggest something that might be useful, like donating them to Get Well Gamers and helping sick children play games to relax in a hospital?  Nope, he recommends sending a console to a third-world country� or to wear as swimwear?  Okay, that�s where we start getting into weird fetishes that I certainly don�t want to hear about on a vaguely closeted, rampantly homosexual network like Spike.  Though this is an excuse to bring creepy guy back out, in bathing suit, and hitting on Samuel some more.  Because this whole broadcast needed more awkward.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

Wait� they knew what they were doing, they kept their presentation short, and they were right on point?  Either I really have gone into an alternate dimension, or that was absurdly heavily edited.  And that would suggest that Spike has editors that don�t completely suck.  At any rate, they present for Best Song, and each is actually played.  The obvious choices among the nominees are between Helicopter if you�re into rock and Loco Roco�s Song if you�re into fanciful Japanese game music.  So naturally, they lose out to Yellowcard�s overwrought pseudo-punk.  Though the presenters claim winner is �Deez Nuts� � it was too much strain making it through the first part without acting like idiots, I suppose.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

The cheerleader from Heroes then comes out, mocking how gamers get addicted to games, not knowing what real literature is.  Lady, someone who plays a cheerleader on a show shouldn�t be going there.  And besides, Kurt Vonnegut was much better than either Hemingway or Faulkner, though I do admit that As I Lay Dying was well-done.  She presents for Most Addictive, which was voted on by gamers.  Oblivion wins, perhaps because everyone playing Guitar Hero 2 was too addicted to put the controller down and vote.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

Gee, we haven�t heard that joke rammed down our throat this year� or last year� or the year before� and actually, we haven�t heard it the year before that.  This is only the fourth VGAs.

Heck, I�d rather get Rosie O�Donnell strung out on coke for six months and romp with her in a bedroom while she cracks jokes for five hours than put up with Sarah Silverman for five minutes.  She starts off by calling this the 4th annual nerd awards.   Would you believe it only gets worse?  She claims that the audience has probably never seen a real live woman before.  Silverman then recommends gamers over 15 should kill themselves and calls all of us like that pathetic.  By this time, you can already head the crowd booing, even though you can tell Spike�s technicians tried to mute it as much as possible.  She�s less popular than Michael Richards in Harlem right now.  She wraps up by saying that gamers should be given an award for AIDS prevention � because we apparently haven�t heard enough lame jokes about not getting any sex (just two major ones tonight before her).                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    Based on reports others have given me about the show, they actually cut a joke she made about being everyone�s masturbation fantasy after the show.  I�m glad they cut that one � the last thing I need is the idea of her naked.

Child abuse � it�s Spike-tastic!  Masi Oka comes out to present for Best Team Sports game.  He makes jokes about fake team sports games, among which is a WNBA joke.  Amazing, someone found a joke about the WNBA lamer than the actual WNBA.  Somehow, despite the fact that EA was four of the five nominations, 2K Sports� NBA 2K7 wins it.  I�m not sure if EA isn�t paying them enough, or they�re starting to exhibit actual integrity on this show.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

They again say it�s an exclusive premier � which was true, as YouTube had it exclusively for almost a week before Spike finally showed it.  Well, they never said to whom it was exclusive.  They bring out a choir wearing black robes to chant with the footage � is that pretentious enough for you?  By the way, if you wanted actual gameplay, sit on it � they�re only showing pre-rendered video.  They�re not even pretending they�re showing you anything other than what might be an intro video.

Pretty much to a man, they had the �clap slowly and look for the exits� look on their faces.  Even with the free food Spike was giving out, they still look like they�re being held prisoner.  At least I can take solace in the fact that real gamers are filling the audience � only real gamers could look that haunted by watching this mockery of video gaming.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

For the most part stupid, although I�m a bit surprised to see Jackson make a joke about President Bush in regards to Gears of War and the opening of the gates of Hell.  Isn�t Spike supposed to be for the macho men who support a president in war, even when he�s obviously putting the country at risk?

                    One question � as they show the clips from the games in question, why don�t they play music from the games in question?

                    <b>11:59</b> � Oblivion manages to win Game of the Year, when it wasn�t even the best PC game this year.  I�d complain, but Spike has done something like this nearly every single year.  Bethesda�s crew is up again, to accept the award.  They their monotone is palpable � either they don�t care, or they have no soul.  I�ll guess the former, as they give their �thanks for giving to us� short speech, and they�re wise enough to give credit to Guitar Hero 2 for being such a great game in their thanks.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

Are there that few jokes they can think of that they have to recycle from just two hours ago?  Oh, right, almost forgot we were dealing with Spike here.  I find it hilarious that the end of the show gets the loudest cheers of the night.  It takes less than a minute of the credit sequence for the crowd to already leave the auditorium less than half-full.  You�d think someone dropped the world-s largest deuce in the middle of the stage� of course, Spike tried to.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">

                    <b>2:38</b> - Okay, it�s past two in the morning, and after making sure this is all readable, I need to crash.  Oddly, while the intense hatred for all of humanity for allowing this to happen is still here, the pain from a wounded soul is not.  I�m not completely sure why.  On one hand, the show has made huge strides in terms of winners � there were more nominees in general that I agreed with, many more winners I agreed with, and even a smattering of winners I didn�t agree with but could respect.  On the other hand, it�s still the most infantile and degrading thing ever done to video gamers.  The awards behind the show certainly have gotten better, but the presentation is still rock bottom.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                                        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
                    Maybe I take solace in the fact that at least one part of the show, the actual awards, are improving to the point where you don�t dismiss them outright.  Or maybe after three years of this venomous tripe, I�ve finally grown immune to it.  One thing�s for sure, though � the VGAs are still the worst night of the year to be a gamer.  And until Spike does away with everything about the show, it�s going to stay that way.                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10">
