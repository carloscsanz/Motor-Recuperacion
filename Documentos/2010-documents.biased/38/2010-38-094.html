<center><b>Characteristic speeds.</b></center><br><br>	
<B>Min. Control Speed on Ground V<SUB>MCG</SUB></B> is defined as the minimum speed at 
which directional control on ground can be recovered after lateral deviation of 
max 30 ft and maintained under the following conditions:
<ul>
	<li>Sudden engine failure on the most critical engine.
	<li>Takeoff thrust on the remaining engine(s).
	<li>Most critical takeoff configuration, normally smallest takeoff flap, unless
	a V<SUB>MCG</SUB> is established for each takeoff flap configuration.
	<li>Most unfavorable TOW an CG position.
	<li>Control maintained by <B>rudder</B> only.
</UL>
<I>Note - V<SUB>MCG</SUB> determines the lowest V<SUB>1</SUB> to be used.</I><br><br>

<B>Min. Control Speed Airborne V<SUB>MCA</SUB></B> is defined as the speed at
which directional control can be recovered and maintained in flight under the
following conditions:
<UL>
	<LI>Sudden engine failure on the most critical engine.
	<LI>Takeoff thrust on the remaining engine(s).
	<LI>Flaps in the smallest position.
	<LI>Landing gear up.
	<LI>Zero yaw or an angle of bank not in excess of 5�.
</UL>
<I>Note - This speed is used in determining V<SUB>R</SUB> and V<SUB>2</SUB>.</I><br>
The 5� bank is used by the manufacturer in certification of V<SUB>MCA</SUB>.
The effect in speed of this bank differ from one aircraft type to another.
For wings level flight the V<SUB>MCA</SUB> will be in the order of 15 kt
for MD-80/90/DC-9. V<SUB>MCA</SUB> problem do normally only occur at low takeoff
weights. At high weights V<SUB>MCA</SUB> is overruled by the stalling speeds, and 
directional control can be maintained with wing level, practically without any 
sideslipping. Consequently, the wings level technique is used because more emphasis 
is placed upon aircraft climb performance at high weights. At low eights the 
performance capability normally is in excess of that required, so favorable bank
angle may be used for heading control if necessary.<br><br>
<B>V<SUB>1</SUB> = Decision speed</B> is the speed at which, for the purpose of
determining the required takeoff runway length, engine failure is assumed to be
recognized and the rejected takeoff initiated. The reaction time used in the 
calculation is about 1 second. Thus for calculation of the required runway
length,  the engine failure is assumed to occur 1 s before V<SUB>1</SUB>. The
total time for pilot actions , until full brakes are applied, is the time
demonstrated during certification plus two seconds (typically 3-4 seconds).
<P>
At  V<SUB>1</SUB> it should be possible to either:
<UL>
	<LI>Reject the takeoff and stop at the end of the runway.
	<LI>Continue the takeoff and reach 35 ft at V<SUB>2</SUB> speed at the end
	of the runway.
</UL>
<I>Note - In certification, stopping from V<SUB>1</SUB> is based on the most
efficient wheel braking on a dry runway without credit for reversing. The
performance in an actual accelerate-stop case may differ from the demonstrated
performance due to a number of reasons such as worn or lost brakes, excessive pilot
reaction time, etc. The benefit of reversers is very small on top of max braking
on a dry runway. Thus, stopping from V<SUB>1</SUB> at a runway limited weight  is 
a very critical task.</I>
</P>
<B>Reduced V<SUB>1</SUB> (15 ft screen height)</B> is possible to use. In
connection with reduced braking action, as on a wet runway, a rejected takeoff
close to V<SUB>1</SUB> becomes even more critical than described above. For
such cases, a reduced V<SUB>1</SUB> can be used to transfer safety margin from
the continued takeoff case to the rejected case to better balance the margins 
between the two options.<br><br>
In accordance with CAA regulations, V<SUB>1</SUB> on wet and contaminated runway
is based on obtaining 15 ft at the end of takeoff distance instead of the normal
35 ft. Takeoff weight calculations must be designed to consider V<SUB>1</SUB>
reductions. Otherwise the contamination may degrade acceleration, after the
engine failure, so the aircraft will not lift off before the end of the runway.
<br><br>
<B>V<SUB>R</SUB> = Rotation speed</B> is the speed at which, for the purpose
of determining required takeoff runway length, rotation of the aircraft is
initiated.
<p>
V<SUB>R</SUB> must be determined not to be less than:
<UL>
	<LI>V<SUB>1</SUB>.
	<LI>1.05 times the minimum control speed, airborne.
	<LI>A speed which permits the attainment of V<SUB>2</SUB> prior to reaching
	35 ft height at the end of the takeoff distance.
	<LI>An upper limit for V<SUB>R</SUB> is set to max tire speed.
</UL>
</P>
<B>V<SUB>2</SUB> = Takeoff safety speed</B> is the speed used to determining
the performance during the initial climbout. In these calculations, V<SUB>2</SUB>
should be reached prior to attaining a height of 35 ft above the runway surface.
<P>
Thus V<SUB>2</SUB> is used in determining:
<UL>
	<LI>The required takeoff distance, prior to the end of which it should be
	attained.
	<LI>The climb requirements limitaions.
	<LI>The obstacle clearance limitaions.
</UL>
V<SUB>2</SUB> shall not be less than:
<UL>
	<LI>1.1 times V<SUB>MCA</SUB>.
	<LI>1.2 times V<SUB>S</SUB>.
</UL>
In practise, V<SUB>2</SUB> should be used as climbout speed in case of engine
failure until the aircraft has attained a safe height above obstacles in the
takeoff direction. Flying at speeds below V<SUB>2</SUB> will result in considerable
loss in climb performance and may crate problems regarding stall.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>Fl up</SUB> and V<SUB>Sl in</SUB></B> are minimum speeds for retraction of FLAPS 
and SLATS after takeoff.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>Clean</SUB></B> is the speed to be used in the final segment of a takeoff
with engine failure, i.e with "CLEAN" aircraft (after flap/slat retraction).
</P>
<B>V<SUB>P</SUB> = Pattern speed</B> is "maneuvering speeds" and gives better margin 
to stall. Used in low level holdings, procedure and circuits.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>P clean</SUB></B> "PATTERN CLEAN", normally the lowest speed with all 
engines running.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>MO</SUB></B> Max operating IAS, limited by structural requirements.
</P>
<B>M<SUB>MO</SUB></B> Max operating Mach, limited by high speed aerodynamics.
</P>
<B>Rough Air Speed</B> is the speed which should be used in connection with
severe turbulence.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>HOLD</SUB></B> Speed to be used during holdings. Below FL 250 the same
as V<SUB>P clean</SUB>. FL 250-290 V<SUB>P clean</SUB> + 10 kt. Above FL 290
V<SUB>P clean</SUB> + 20 kt.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>ref</SUB></B> is reference speed used to derive other speeds for different
phases of flight by adding of fixed increments. The amount to be added are stated
in the respective aircraft operating manual. When V<SUB>ref</SUB> is used without
additional flap suffix, it is based on the full landing configuration. Occasionally
it is necessary to use V<SUB>ref</SUB> based on other flap setting. In such cases
the configuration is always indicated as a suffix (V<SUB>ref 20</SUB>).
</P>
Landing runway length requirements are based on V<SUB>ref</SUB> at 50 ft over
the runway threshold.
</P>
<B>V<SUB>TH</SUB></B> For aircraft not using V<SUB>ref</SUB>, landing runway
length requirements are based on V<SUB>TH</SUB> at 50 ft over the runway
threshold.
