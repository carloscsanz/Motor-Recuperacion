Runner for the Bucharest City Hall, candidate in tandem for prime-minister, president of the main opposition party, the tacit ally of a minority government, the negotiator of a coalition on equal bases, the second man in the state, candidate to the presidential elections, Mircea Geoana was a first-hand actor in the past few years.
