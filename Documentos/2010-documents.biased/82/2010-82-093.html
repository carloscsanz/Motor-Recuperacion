<p>Frankfurt 10 September 2007 &#8211; Land Rover remains on target to achieve its third successive record sales year after a spectacular August in both well established and emerging markets around the world.</p>

<p>Last month, global sales were over 15,000, a 36% increase over the previous August. This puts Land Rover in its strongest sales position in its near 60 year history with over 141,000 cars sold so far this year, 13% ahead of 2006.</p>

<p>The all new Freelander 2 has helped to deliver some of the rise, but the flagship model, Range Rover, now in its fifth year, continues to dominate the luxury segment with sales 20% ahead of last year. The growth has been driven by the popularity of the new V8 diesel engine which gives a 32% fuel improvement and a 15% cut in CO2 emissions compared with the naturally aspirated petrol engine.</p>

<p>Growth was seen in virtually all markets with strong performances in Russia (up 92% year to date) and China (up a phenomenal 178% in August and 87% ahead year to date).</p>

<p>August was also a great success in the more mature markets. The US was up by 32% and Europe by 50% (25% year to date).</p>

<p>Phil Popham, Land Rover&#8217;s Managing Director, said, &#8220;To achieve this level of growth in both new and established markets against a background of intense<br />
competition is testament to the strength, desirability and relevance of the Land Rover brand and the truly impressive model line up.</p>

<p>&#8220;The global presence and strong model mix puts us in a flexible business position and we remain firmly in the black.&#8221;</p>

<p>The figures were released on the eve of the Frankfurt Motor Show where Land Rover will reveal details of sustainable technology and a major partnership with a global humanitarian organisation.</p>

		CONSTRUCTION OF THE LONDON MASTERS RALLYCROSS CIRCUIT BEGINS		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

<p>The first phase of construction of the rallycross circuit for the 2007 London Masters competition, held at ExCel on Saturday 8th and Sunday 9th December is now complete. Built in three phases, the first phase involved creating a hardcore base which will withstand any amount of punishment from the top Rallycross cars.</p>

<p>The surface has been screened, re-graded, leveled and rolled to the highest specification. The loose sections of the circuit, that needed to be constructed three months prior to the event to give time for the areas to settle, are now in place to ensure that the surface is perfect for high performance motorsport.</p>

<p>The circuit is a minimum of 14.5 metres wide with an approximate length of 650 metres. The lap time for a Division 1 car is expected to be between 30 and 35 seconds with an average speed of approximately 80mph. The circuit has been constructed with fast flowing corners, featuring two spectacular yumps.</p>

<p>The work was carried out by the PSM Motorsport Ltd circuit construction team &amp; Starting Grid Ltd in association with Shannon Holdings. Philip Bunn from Starting Grid said: &#8220;It was amazing to see the bulldozer go in and there were a few nail biting moments but the foundation of the circuit is now in place and looks fantastic. We would like to thank Ollie O&#8217;Donovan and Shannon Holdings for their involvement with the event and the supplying of the equipment for the construction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The London Masters is just one of the exciting features of the 2007 London Motorsport Show which covers all disciplines of motorsport from karting through to Formula One and is a must for any motor racing enthusiast. For information, visit <a href="http://www.londonmotorsport.co.uk">www.londonmotorsport.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of sponsorship opportunities available for both The London Masters and The London Motorsport Show. For further details on these and information on exhibiting, please contact Philip Bunn on tel: +44 (0)1444 246446 or email: <a href="mailto:philip@primarysport.com">philip@primarysport.com</a>.

<p>The new Porsche Cayenne GTS, which makes its world debut at the IAA Auto Show in Frankfurt, Germany, on September 11, features a specially developed chassis: it is the first Cayenne to offer the electronically-controlled damping system, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), with steel springs. This combination, which also lowers the Cayenne by 24mm, was previously reserved exclusively for Porsche sports cars.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the car boasts an enhanced version of the direct fuel injection (DFI) 4.8-litre V8 petrol engine. The engine in the Cayenne GTS yields 405bhp (298 kW) at 6,500rpm &#8211; 20bhp more than in the Cayenne S. Maximum torque remains unchanged at 500Nm at 3,500rpm.</p>

<p>In order to further exploit this horsepower increase, the GTS comes as standard with a six-speed manual gearbox and a shorter axle final drive ratio than the Cayenne S (4.1:1 as opposed to 3.55:1). The Cayenne GTS can thus accelerate from 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in just 6.1 seconds, precisely 0.5 seconds quicker than the Cayenne S.</p>

<p>The Cayenne GTS can be specified with the Tiptronic S six-speed automatic transmission, in which guise it offers an average fuel consumption of 20.3mpg (13.9 litres/100 km) in accordance with EU standards.</p>

<p>The Cayenne GTS is fitted with Porsche Traction Management (PTM) permanent all-wheel drive and the adaptive PASM chassis as standard. Air suspension is available as an option, as is the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active anti-roll system which enhances the handling and ride comfort further still. Newly-developed 12-way adjustable sports seats and a mix of leather and Alcantara upholstery creates a sporty interior ambience.</p>

<p>The new Cayenne GTS is instantly recognizable: the front and rear share styling cues with the Cayenne Turbo, and the striking 14mm wheel-arch extensions offer plenty of space for the 21-inch alloy rims with 295/35 R21 tyres fitted as standard. Two new colours have also been reserved exclusively for the GTS: GTS Red and Nordic Gold Metallic.</p>

<p>The new Porsche Cayenne GTS will be priced from &#163;54,350, including a Porsche Vehicle Tracking System (VTS), a sophisticated vehicle security package approved to Thatcham Category 5 standard, and a Porsche Driving Experience programme.  The car will be on sale in the UK and Ireland from February 2008.</p>

The Frankfurt-bound show car was leaked to Carscoop, but unfortunately, no specifics were given to go with the photos. Carscoop speculates that it's possibly built on the VW Tiguan platform. We speculate that its very Audi R8-reminiscent front end treatment and more angular lines signal a possible change in the marque's design language. We'll also go out on a limb and guess that there's a TDI underhood (because it's a European VW brand making a Euro-show debut) and that someday, SEAT will offer a trucklet loosely based on this, albeit with 4 doors and taillamps that are higher than bumper-level. We'll stop now and wait for the inevitable press release from SEAT, at which point we'll tell you the real story. At least rearward visibility won't be a problem in this puppy.</p>

<p>Chrysler Group will show the four new models that will be launched in the UK in 2008 at next week&#8217;s Frankfurt Motor Show.</p>

<p>The Jeep Cherokee is all-new and will launch in the UK in May 2008. On-road ride and handling have been improved and refined with a new independent front suspension, new five-link rear suspension and rack-and-pinion steering. The Cherokee will feature an updated 2.8-litre diesel engine, the Selec-Trac II full-time four-wheel drive system plus the choice of a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic gearbox.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert, Managing Director of Chrysler UK, said: &#8220;The Cherokee started everything off for Jeep when we first launched our brands here in 1993. Since then the Cherokee has become an off-road icon in the UK with more than 50,000 sold so far.</p>

<p>&#8220;The new Cherokee&#8217;s exterior has been redesigned and now takes on a more rugged, classic Jeep look. Inside, cargo and storage space has increased and seat comfort has been improved, while the new optional &#8216;Sky Slider&#8217; full-length canvas roof is sure to attract customers wanting the open air benefits of a convertible combined with the space and safety features of a family SUV.&#8221;</p>

<p>The all-new Chrysler Grand Voyager, the Chrysler Sebring Cabrio and the Dodge Journey will also be on show on the Chrysler Group stand.</p>

<p>The Chrysler Grand Voyager will launch in early 2008 with an all-new exterior and a new interior design with Stow &#8216;N Go seating together with an updated 2.8-litre diesel engine.</p>

<p>A host of new features will make the new seven-seat model the ultimate people carrier. Heated first and second row seats; rear-view interior conversation mirror; a removable torch in the rear quarter panel; electric windows in the power sliding second-row doors and movable LED reading lamps will all help make the new Grand Voyager very family-friendly.</p>

<p>The Chrysler Sebring Cabrio will be launched in the UK in early 2008 with a petrol and diesel engine. All UK models will feature a folding soft roof that folds into three sections and stows in less than 30 seconds. The automatic roof system features automatic latching, a powered tonneau cover and remote control via the key fob.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert added: &#8220;The Sebring Cabrio is a large four seat two-door convertible that will offer outstanding value for money compared to the competition in a stunning package. The Cabrio is three inches longer than the saloon and this means that despite the folding roof there is enough cargo space to hold two golf bags when the roof is retracted &#8211; or four golf bags when the roof is up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The all-new 2008 Dodge Journey is a seven seat crossover MPV that combines the space and practicality of an MPV with the style of an SUV and the ride, handling and fuel efficiency of a family saloon. It will launch in mid-2008 and effectively replaces the Voyager in the Chrysler Group model range.</p>

<p>    * Innovative Kuga Crossover will be revealed at Frankfurt Motor Show<br />
    * Inspired by the iosis X Concept revealed in Paris 2006<br />
    * On-road Focus DNA with 'intelligent' AWD for substantial off-road ability<br />
    * Powered by Ford's efficient 2.0-litre 136PS TDCi engine</p>

<p>BRENTWOOD, Essex, 05 September, 2007 &#8211; Ford's product portfolio is expanding again &#8211; and in another new direction.  The new Ford Kuga is an exciting AWD crossover that combines style with technology and promises impressive on-road dynamics coupled with substantial off-road ability.</p>

<p>On sale in the UK summer 2008, the new Ford Kuga will be unveiled to the public at next week's Frankfurt Motor Show in near production form.  This trend-setting newcomer takes many of its design ideas from the iosis X concept shown at the Paris Motor Show last year.</p>

<p>Combining elements of SUV and estate car design with a coup&#233;-like profile in a package similar in size to a Focus hatchback, the Kuga is the latest showcase for Ford's acclaimed kinetic design.</p>

<p>The Ford Kuga will boast an intelligent all-wheel-drive system which contributes positively to normal road use and helps give an almost sporty dynamic ability for those who want to use it cross country.</p>

<p>Kuga's powertrain will feature Ford's established and fuel efficient 2.0-litre, 136 PS Duratorq TDCi common-rail diesel engine, mated to the slick Durashift six-speed manual transmission.  Further details of the Kuga powertrain will be released closer to launch in early 2008.</p>

<p>Adopting many of the styling cues from Ford's iosis X Concept, and finished in the same unique "Ice White" body colour with the bold wheel arches filled with the same 19 &#8211;inch alloy wheels, the Kuga has poise and presence. The athletic look is highlighted by bold features such as the trapezoidal front grills, rising belt-line and kick-up of the rear window graphic and the dramatic swept back headlamp shapes.</p>

<p>For the production Ford Kuga the roof profile of the iosis X Concept has been adjusted to a slightly higher silhouette offering comfortable accommodation for five people. Practicality is a key attribute and the luggage compartment is accessed via a split tailgate. Together with the divided rear lights this ensures the maximum full load width is available for loading and unloading.</p>

<p>Inside, fine leathers and striking orange piping dominate. The Ebony interior is set off by a centre console and details in the door which also feature the piano-white finish from iosis X.</p>

<p>A hint of the technology coming in Kuga, and other future Ford models, is seen in the new Blaupunkt navigation system which incorporates a 7-inch colour display to also show images from a rear view camera incorporated into the tailgate</p>

<p>Now that it's been confirmed the BMW X6 will make it's world debut in Frankfurt next week, those tasked with keeping the prototypes under cover have been given the green light to show a little more skin... err, metal. These newest shots don't leave much to the imagination, giving us a very clear view of both the front and rear of BMW's SAV.</p>

<p>The front clip has a decidedly sportier appearance than its big brother the X5, with larger air dams, kidney grilles and fog lamp recesses. The sloping roofline out back is as extreme as we expected, and the small spoiler integrates smoothly into the hatch.</p>

<p>Frankfurt is less than a week away, so, as always, watch this space.</p>

- DUAL PEACE OF MIND -<br />
</em></p><div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/blogs/4x4newz/53606-d-mit.jpg" alt="Mitsubishi Concept cX" title="Mitsubishi Concept cX" width="350" height="261" align="left" /></div>
<p>Building upon 70 years of 4-wheel drive expertise, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) is in a privileged position to appreciate the customer benefits of this technology, both in terms of on-road active safety and off-road ability, from Lancer Evolution to Pajero.</p>

<p>In parallel, MMC is acutely aware of the pressing issues brought by climate change and is implementing a holistic environmental global strategy, through its &#8220;Environment Initiative Program 2010&#8221; (EiP 2010) umbrella programme.</p>

<p>Combining these two &#8220;peace-of-mind&#8221; approaches, Mitsubishi Motors will introduce Concept-cX at the 62nd Frankfurt Motor Show: a vibrant demonstration that driving pleasure and corporate responsibility are not mutually exclusive and the showcase for the CO2 friendly all-new Euro 5 Clean Diesel family of engines, co-developed by MMC and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and to be launched in 2009.</p>

<p>Ingrained guiding principles<br />
Mitsubishi Motors Corporation&#8217;s corporate citizenship and its concern over environmental issues is neither a recent phenomenon nor a quick marketing trick.</p>

<p>Indeed, they are deep-rooted in Mitsubishi&#8217;s corporate culture, as formalised in several guiding principles edicted in the 1930s by Koyata Iwazaki (of the founding Iwazaki family) the fourth and last President of the old Mitsubishi organisation:</p>

<p>    * Enrich society &#8211; both materially and spiritually &#8211; and safeguard the global environment.<br />
    * Conduct business in the spirit of integrity and fairness and on a foundation of transparency and openness.<br />
    * Adopt a global perspective in developing and expanding business.</p>

<p>A few decades later, these principles are very much alive and respected throughout the Mitsubishi group of companies.</p>

<p>The first of these principles was the trigger for MMC&#8217;s continued efforts in the area of environmentally-friendly technology, from the MCA (Mitsubishi Clean Air) engine technology of the 1970s to today&#8217;s wide spectrum of solutions.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/blogs/4x4newz/53606mit.jpg" alt="Mitsubishi Concept cX" title="Mitsubishi Concept cX" width="350" height="261" align="left" /></div>
<p>Since the 1993 Mitsubishi Motors Environmental Council, MMC has formalised its commitment to use its engineering expertise to contribute to a cleaner environment.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has adopted an all-embracing approach in addressing global environmental issues. Under its &#8220;EIP 2010&#8221; (&#8220;Environment Initiative Program 2010&#8221;) umbrella project, the Company is actively engaged in the development of a wide range of such technologies, covering:</p>

<p>    * Powertrains (see below)<br />
    * Materials (plant-based &#8220;Green Plastic&#8221;,&#8230;),<br />
    * Processes (&#8220;Design for Environment&#8221; guiding principles,&#8230;),<br />
    * Manufacturing (pollution-prevention and recycling measures).<br />
    * Conservation ("Pajero Forest &amp; Local Mountain Restoration Initiative" aiming to conserve and cultivate Japan's forests and woodlands,&#8230;).</p>

<p>Europe = Next Generation Clean Diesel<br />
Whilst pursuing long-term fundamental research &amp; development, Mitsubishi Motors has taken a very down-to-earth view on marketable &#8220;green&#8221; technologies to make a bigger impact short term.</p>

<p>In particular, MMC has decided to go regional with powertrain solutions matching the everyday reality of very different regional needs, driving patterns &amp; infrastructures:</p>

<p>          * Clean Diesel Euro 5 family of engines for Europe,<br />
          * Next-generation electric vehicle for Japan,<br />
          * Flexible fuel vehicle for Brazil,</p>

<p>Considering the overwhelming importance of diesel in Europe (50+% of sales on average), the most effective short-term was to elect diesel as the low CO2 solution for this region, as opposed to fancier technologies, ultimately limited in impact by cost, sheer volume or recyclability.</p>

<p>There lies the strategic importance of MMC&#8217;s next generation of Euro 5 Clean Diesel engines. Developed jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, this new family of powerplants is a key element in Mitsubishi Motors' efforts to lower CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Features contributing to the new engine's class-topping power output and Euro 5 emissions performance include a new high-efficiency turbocharger and high-efficiency combustion characteristics that stem from the application of own analytic technology of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Motors.<br />
Consistent with its no-frills approach, MMC has taken the decision to bring forward to early 2009 the start of production of this family of engines to Europe, one full year earlier than scheduled (following the European introduction these powerplants will also be phased into other markets). This advancement will allow MMC to meet the needs of the growing number of environment-conscious customers quicker and make de facto a more substantial and short(er)-term impact.</p>

<p>Real World<br />
In this context, Concept-cX represents a proposal for an accessible, affordable, sustainable and realistic solution to today&#8217;s pressing issues, whilst preserving authentic driving pleasure.</p>

<p>Case-in-point, Concept-cX follows the popular compact SUV route to carry this message right at the heart of the market, where SUVs are one of the fastest growing segments.</p>

<p>Sharp in design and in dynamics, Mitsubishi&#8217;s Concept-cX boasts an excellent environmental performance to be seen in the (targeted) low fuel consumption and emission levels achieved by its 100 kW (136 ps) @ 4,000 rpm / 280 Nm @ 2,000 rpm next generation 1.8-litre Clean Diesel DOHC 16 valve 4 cylinder engine. Amongst other technologies, it features a variable geometry (VG) turbocharger &#8211; to generate optimum boost pressure for all engine loads &#8211; as well as DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) and DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst).</p>

<p>For this concept car application, the 1.8 l Clean Diesel engine is mated to Mitsubishi Motors&#8217; Twin Clutch SST technology. Recently announced, this automated manual transmission combines the economy and dynamic driving of a manual transmission with the convenience of an automatic gearbox. In essence:</p>

<p>    * High power transmission efficiency and low fuel consumption, on par with a conventional manual unit.<br />
    * Slick, sporty gear changing with no clutch pedal.<br />
    * Quick response and smooth shifting.</p>

<p>Concept-cX&#8217;s further green credentials include eco-friendly &#8220;Green Plastics&#8221;, MMC&#8217;s proprietary plant-based resin technology - made from bamboo and other plant-based resins - effectively used for interior trim materials, such as floor mats, door trim, tail gate trim and seat back panels.</p>

<p>On-road demand<br />
Surfing on the popular compact SUV wave by strategy (up 54% from 325,000 in 2001 to 500,000 in 2006 and with further 35% growth expected between 2006 and 2009) and by heritage (from the 1936 PX33 to the 2007 Outlander, L200 and Pajero), Concept-cX does acknowledge the essentially on-road usage of these vehicles.</p>

<p>Trendy substitutes to more conventional formats such as MPVs, compact SUVs add a bit of shine to utility whilst fulfilling all the duties expected from compact family cars. Hence the split tailgate used by Outlander but also Concept-cX for instance.<br />
Compact (410 cm), low (155 cm), wide (175 cm), sitting on a long wheelbase (252,5 cm) and wide tracks (151 cm/151 cm) and planted on its 225/45R19 tyres, Concept-cX offers passenger car-like stance and dynamics, as suggested by its gaping Lancer &#8220;Jet Fighter&#8221; grille.</p>

<p>Its on-road abilities are further enhanced by the use of Mitsubishi&#8217;s sophisticated AWC (All-Wheel Control) technology, similar in essence to the device successfully introduced with the new Outlander.</p>

<p>This electronically controlled 4WD system offers the driver a choice of three modes (2WD, 4WD Auto, 4WD Lock) to match traction control to his preferences or driving conditions. The centre differential features an electronically controlled coupling that uses feed-forward control to determine the optimum front/rear torque split from sensor data on throttle opening, vehicle speed, road conditions and driver inputs.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/blogs/4x4newz/53606-a-mit.jpg" alt="Mitsubishi Concept cX" title="Mitsubishi Concept cX" width="350" height="272" align="right" /></div>
<p>Jet fighter<br />
Featuring the &#8220;Jet Fighter&#8221; grille introduced with the all-new Lancer family and using a derivative of Outlander&#8217;s 4-wheel drive drivetrain, Concept-cX creates an interesting link between Mitsubishi&#8217;s passenger cars and SUVs, an intention clearly visible in its exterior design.</p>

<p>Indeed, that SUV / hatchback crossover positioning is stressed through design features shared by both formats. However, Concept-cX incorporates a sports car flavour stronger than usually applied to this genre and very much consistent with Mitsubishi&#8217;s impeccable sporting heritage.</p>

<p>Wedge<br />
The intention is evident when considering Concept-cX&#8217;s overall format: a tight and powerful wedge, slotted within four bulging wheel-arches, fronted by the vast expanse of a clam-shell hood and finishing with deep-set headlamps either sides of the reverse slant of an over-sized version of Mitsubishi&#8217;s trademark  &#8220;Jet Fighter&#8221; grille.</p>

<p>The flanks themselves are all motion, with beltline, Lancer-like character line and even the position of the door handles following airflows.</p>

<p>At the back, all lines converge and merge into the wrap-around &#8220;fast hatch&#8221; tucked in between the powerful rear fenders, with the eyebrows of the (front) headlamps echoed by the (rear) roof spoiler and the lower vent / central exhaust resembling jets&#8217; thrust nozzles.</p>

<p>Concept-cX also ticks the convenience box with its deep panoramic backlight, twin-stage split tailgate and high mounted rear combination lamps.</p>

<p>As a finishing touch, Concept-cX sports a sharp &amp; pure metallic medium blue hue that evokes the image of a crystal-clear lake, while the use of fine aluminium flecks throughout creates a nearly transparent metallic finish.<br />
Open<br />
Using MMC&#8217;s proprietary Green Plastic (floor mats, door trim, tail gate trim and seat back panels) and upholstered in earthy tones of brown (leather) and off-white, the interior bridges the gap between sporty and comfy, mixing driver-oriented round meters with bench seats and soft padding to create an interior space that cocoons the occupants, but remind them that they are in a car. Still&#8230;</p>

<p>Thinly padded but welcoming nonetheless, the organically-shaped front backrests are mated to a bench seat integrating the transmission lever (Twin Clutch SST and 2WD/4WD functions) as well as the starter and some of the warning lights (bonnet open, &#8220;fast hatch&#8221; open, low fuel).</p>

<p>The dashboard itself points to the underlying strength of the car&#8217;s frame and invite all occupants to share the voyage through a mega-sized information centre touch screen</p>

<p>Dodge will unveil its all-new family crossover vehicle at the 2007 International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt this September.</p>

<p>The Dodge Journey is a seven-seat vehicle that combines the space and practicality of an MPV with the style of an SUV and the ride, handling and fuel efficiency of a family saloon.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert, Managing Director of Chrysler Group UK said: &#8220;The Dodge Journey will attract drivers that need to have an MPV but don&#8217;t want to own a car with traditional people-carrier looks. The bold styling of the Journey means it shares the same &#8216;stand out from the crowd&#8217; looks of the new Nitro and Avenger and our latest model will offer the same excellent value for money that Dodge customers in the UK have come to expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>The front-wheel drive Dodge Journey will be launched in the UK in summer 2008 and will feature a 2.4-litre petrol engine or a 2.0-litre diesel engine. Both powertrains will be available with either a manual or automatic gearbox.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert added: &#8220;Families that need space for 5+2 will love the flexible seating system, spacious storage bins and underfloor storage areas. Safety is also very important for these customers and with ESP and three-row side curtain airbags this really is the ideal family vehicle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of its success in the emergency sector, &#352;koda&#8217;s has released a purpose-built medical car &#8211; the 4 x 4 Octavia Scout Paramedic &#8211; which made its debut at the National Association of Police Fleet Managers (NAPFM) exhibition in Swindon on 14 and 15 August.</p>

<p>The Octavia Scout Paramedic is &#352;koda&#8217;s first purpose-built, fully-operational medical car and has been commissioned as a direct response to the high demand for the Octavia Estate 4x4, launched in the UK last June.</p>

<p>Martin Burke, Head of Business Sales at &#352;koda, comments: &#8220;We have been inundated with orders from the emergency services in the last few months.  Releasing a purpose-built, part-equipped car like the Scout Paramedic allows us to meet the needs of our clients quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>&#8220;With its off-road ability, the 4x4 Octavia Scout Paramedic is particularly suited to emergency situations in places of limited access such as country roads, flooded fields and rocky hills.  We decided to unveil the vehicle at the NAPFM exhibition to showcase the clear benefits the Scout can bring to the police force in light of the ever increasing challenges they face.&#8221;</p>

<p>As well as offering &#8220;an extra bit of car&#8221; &#352;koda offers its business customers high quality customer service and a personal approach which differentiate the car manufacture in the highly competitive fleet market.   </p>

<p>The Octavia Scout Paramedic is now available to the fleet market.</p>

<p>Building upon 70 years of four-wheel drive expertise, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) is in a privileged position to appreciate the customer benefits of this technology, in terms of on-road active safety and off-road ability, from Lancer Evolution to Pajero.</p>

<p>At the occasion of the 62nd Frankfurt Motor Show, MMC will combine this dynamic fluency with the first tangible demonstration in Europe of its regionalised environmental strategy, previewing the CO2-friendly next generation Euro 5 Clean Diesel family of engines co-developed with its parent company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</p>

<p>As a showcase for this dual &#8220;peace of mind&#8221;, Mitsubishi Motors will unveil Mitsubishi Concept-cX* in Frankfurt: an accessible, affordable, sustainable and realistic solution to today&#8217;s pressing issues. Sporty and flexible, Mitsubishi Concept-cX will follow the popular compact SUV route to carry this message right at the heart of the market.</p>

<p>Featuring the &#8220;Jet Fighter&#8221; grille already seen with Lancer Sports Sedan and using a soft-road application of the Outlander-derived Electric control four-wheel drive drivetrain, the 4.10m long Mitsubishi Concept-cX will also intend to create a link between Mitsubishi&#8217;s passenger cars and SUVs.</p>

<p>Sharp in design and in dynamics, Mitsubishi Concept-cX will boast an excellent environmental performance to be seen in the low fuel consumption and emission levels achieved by its next generation 1.8-litre Clean Diesel engine, mated to an automated manual transmission. A preview of a family of powertrains to be launched in the course of 2009, it features a variable geometry diffuser (VG) turbocharger &#8211; to generate optimum boost pressure for all engine loads &#8211; and DPF technologies.</p>

<p>Mitsubishi Concept-cX&#8217;s further green credentials include eco-friendly &#8220;Green Plastics&#8221;, MMC&#8217;s proprietary plant-based resin technology, effectively used for interior trim materials.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has adopted an all-embracing approach in addressing global environmental issues. Under its &#8220;EIP 2010&#8221; (&#8220;Environment Initiative Program 2010&#8221;) umbrella project, the Company is actively engaged in the development of a wide range of such technologies, covering:</p>

<p>          o  Powertrains suiting regional needs, driving patterns &amp; infrastructures:<br />
                + Clean Diesel Euro 5 family of engines for Europe<br />
                + MiEV next-generation electric vehicle for Japan<br />
                + Flexible fuel vehicle for Brazil<br />
          o Materials (plant-based &#8220;Green Plastic&#8221;,&#8230;)<br />
          o Processes (&#8220;Design for Environment&#8221; guiding principles,&#8230;).<br />
          o Manufacturing (pollution-prevention and recycling measures).<br />
          o Conservation (&#8220;Pajero Forest &amp; Local Mountain Restoration Initiative&#8221; aiming to conserve and cultivate Japan&#8217;s forests and woodlands).</p>

<p>Note: &#8220;Pajero&#8221; is &#8220;Montero&#8221; in Spain and &#8220;Shogun&#8221; in the UK.</p>

<p>DaimlerChrysler, which markets 3.5 to 7.5 tonne Mitsubishi Fuso Canter chassis through its Mercedes-Benz truck dealers, has added a high-mobility 4x4 Canter 7.5-tonner to the model line-up.  Fuso product manager Mike Mudie says the model 7C18&#8217;s high ground clearance and &#8216;cross country&#8217; capability is expected to appeal to public utilities and forestry concerns, especially those that might aspire to DC&#8217;s Unimog product but have budget restrictions.  He adds that Network Rail contractors have shown a positive interest in a road-rail conversion of the 4x4 Canter. As shown in Birmingham, the chassis is powered by a Mitsubishi 4 litre diesel rated at 180hp, exerting 530Nm maximum torque.    </p>

		MAN six-wheeler makes its debut		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

<p>Making its first public appearance in the UK is MAN&#8217;s &#8216;cruiserweight&#8217; TGM rigid six-wheeler.  The 26 tonnes gvw 6x4 is the last model in the German company&#8217;s regeneration programme, which began with the heavy-duty TGA tractor and eight-wheeler chassis and continued with the launch at the NEC two years ago of the light/medium duty TGL, aimed principally at the 7.5 tonne segment.</p>

<p>Though MAN was without a six-wheeler on the UK market for many years, the subsequent adoption of the light and compact cab from Steyr (inherited when MAN acquired control of the Austrian manufacturer in 1991) enabled it to become a major player in the three-axled rigid market with an attractively light and competitively priced chassis.</p>

<p>There has been another wait for operators as MAN has geared up for TGM six-wheeler production.  It is a far more advanced and better equipped model than its predecessor, but it remains to be seen whether operators of the former model, especially in the crucial tipper sector will be ready to pay the inevitably higher price for the TGM, which also brings a payload penalty.</p>

<p>MAN&#8217;s commitment to EGR NOx reduction, requiring no regular AdBlue replenishment, could prove critical on its 6x4 contender, where typical tipper operators instinctively opt for simplicity.</p>

<p>At 7.5 tonnes, MAN&#8217;s TGL chassis could benefit even more from the EGR stategy. Many users in that weight segment are rental companies or small tradesmen for whom the SCR &#8211; standard in all other 7.5 tonners, apart from the Japanese contenders &#8211; could be one complication too far. </p>

&#183;        New 156PS, 3.0-litre TDCi engine<br />
&#183;        On sale August 2007. Prices available nearer the time.</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM, NEC, 24 April, 2007 &#8211; Spicy colours, extra equipment and a new engine for Ford's Ranger Wildtrak will make this a special edition not to be missed at this year's Commercial Vehicle Show. Already known for strong pulling power and car-like comfort, the new Ranger Wildtrak adds further style and capabilities to the range.</p>

<p>This latest model has rear box rail extensions, a stylish, aerodynamic sports bar, lower sports cladding and tail lamp protectors to enhance its appearance. Side intake 'gills' add to the visual effect. New integrated door mirror indicators and puddle lamps provide additional differentiation and Wildtrak decals on the front, side and rear identify it as a special Ford Ranger.</p>

<p>Combined with these stylish features are new alloy wheels, a new sports front grille, side steps, an aluminium style front over rider and roof rails, an integrated bedliner and a rear protection bar with integrated park distance control.</p>

<p>The cabin features all-new heated seats in leather and perforated alcantara with orange tricot backing, floor mats with Wildtrak logo, new sports steering wheel, dash-mounted off-road 'information centre', premium interior and footwell lighting. New Wildtrak scuff plates complete the package.</p>

<p>The Ford Ranger Wildtrak is available with an exclusive range of unique two-tone colours: Chilli Orange or Passion Red combined with Titanium Grey on the lower part of the body for a truly striking appearance. Other body colours that can be combined with Titanium Grey are Steel Silver, Andaman Blue, Storm Black and Strato Blue.</p>

<p>Under the bonnet is a new and powerful 3.0-litre TDCi engine with 156PS  and 380Nm of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is tuned for fuel economy while maintaining good overtaking ability.</p>

<p>Steve Kimber, commercial vehicles director, Ford of Britain, said: "The latest Ford Ranger is selling faster than the previous model. The new Wildtrak will take us deeper into the fiercely competitive pick-up market with a truck that really makes a statement." </p>

<p>Toyota has worked some motor sport magic on its legendary Hilux pick-up to create a special concept that&#8217;s big on both looks and performance.</p>

<p>The muscular Hilux Sport Concept will make its debut as a central attraction on the Toyota stand at the 2007 Commercial Vehicle Show.</p>

<p>The team at Toyota (GB) has created the pick-up as a one-off special and it is the first LCV-based concept to be shown by Toyota in the UK. The 3.0-litre D-4D diesel engine has a Toyota Motorsport power upgrade that increases output from 169 to around 200bhp. And with the addition of monster 22-inch alloy wheels, a sport trucktop, chrome-finished grille and B-pillars, tinted windows and lights and a special-design front guard, this unique Double Cab model has macho looks to match its grunt.</p>

<p>There are no plans to put the Hilux Sport Concept into production, but visitors to the CV show can view the full current Toyota LCV line-up. As previously announced, the display will include:</p>

<p>    *</p>

<p>      Hilux &#8211; refreshed for 2007 with higher output, Euro IV-compliant 2.5 and 3.0-litre D-4D engines, in Single, Extra and Double Cab body styles.<br />
    *</p>

<p>      Hiace &#8211; a new-look model for 2007, available with Euro IV-compliant 2.5-litre D-4D engines. A single grade across the range provides electrically adjustable heated door mirrors, electric windows, remote central locking, ABS, driver&#8217;s airbag and remote central locking as standard.<br />
    *</p>

<p>      Dyna &#8211; equipped with a new, more powerful 3.0-litre D-4D engine, completing Toyota&#8217;s comprehensive range of Euro IV powertrains for its LCV line-up.</p>

<p>The CV Show will run from 24 to 26 April. Toyota will be located on Stand 4351 in Hall 4.</p>

		BRILLIANCE SETS AMBITIOUS GOAL FOR EUROPE, BUT UK MUST WAIT FOR THE CHINESE BRAND		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

<p>Another motor show, another Chinese manufacturer. And this one&#8217;s serious about Europe. The Geneva motor show saw the official European launch of Brilliance Jinbei Automobile, with ambitious plans to sell 75,000 cars across the continent by 2010.</p>

<p>But the UK will have to wait for the cars as right-hand drive production is not scheduled until after 2010. In any case, European distributor HSO Motors Europe has a task on its hands to meet its targets in Europe &#8211; it wants to sell 15,000 of the cars this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Geneva Show opens the door to Europe for Brilliance,&#8221; said Hans-Ulrich Sachs, head of HSO. &#8220;It represents a huge milestone on the journey to make Chinese cars popular in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first model is the BS6, a large saloon styled by Giorgio Giugiaro&#8217;s ItalDesign organisation and with ride and handling &#8220;optimised&#8221; by Porsche. Two-litre, 122bhp and 2.4-litre, 130bhp petrol engines are provided by Mitsubishi, and are Euro-IV compliant. Prices will start at around &#8364;20,000 &#8211; or &#163;14,000.</p>

<p>Later this year the BS6 will be followed by the smaller BS4 mid-range saloon and a coupe called BC3. The BS4, also penned by Giugiaro, is based on a shortened version of the BS6 platform. It has a 1.8-litre Mitsubishi engine and five-speed gearbox. The engine comes in turbocharged guise too, coupled to Brilliance&#8217;s own four-speed automatic gearbox.</p>

<p>The BC3 was styled by Pininfarina and also has a 1.8-litre turbo &#8211; but this is Brilliance&#8217;s own design, developing 170bhp. It also meets Euro IV standards. All these cars were displayed at Geneva. And a diesel engine for BS6 and BS will be added by the end of 2007. Future models include a compact car called BS2 and an SUV.</p>

<p>Brilliance has experience of building quality cars &#8211; it&#8217;s BMW&#8217;s Chinese assembler. It has invested heavily in manufacturing facilities in Shenyang, and will build 200,000 vehicles this year &#8211; 20,000 of them BMWs.</p>

<p>HSO Motors is currently signing up European distributors, including Belgian car supermarket operator Cardoen and France&#8217;s AsieAuto, which already distributes Chinese Landwind SUVs through a 100-strong network of dealers. HSO plans to handle German sales itself. Brilliance wants 700 European dealers by the end of 2008.</p>

<p>-          Altea Freetrack Prototype on display at Geneva Motor Show</p>

<p>-          Based on recently-launched Altea XL</p>

<p>-          4x4 concept suggests design of future SEAT production model</p>

<p>SEAT is tantalising those visiting its Geneva Motor Show stand this year with a dramatic concept that points the way to a future production car: the Altea Freetrack Prototype.  Far from being a mere styling exercise for the Technical Centre in Martorell, the concept gives a preview of the design and technological innovations of the Altea Freetrack, destined to arrive in the near future.</p>

<p>The Freetrack Prototype is 185 mm higher than the Altea XL on which it is based, which results in impressive approach, departure and ramp breakover angles.  These features, combined with its full four-wheel-drive system, make the Freetrack Prototype a genuine off-roader.</p>

<p>The Altea Freetrack Prototype has an aggressive look that reflects its adventurous character, and yet it retains the dynamic look that is expected of the Spanish brand.  Moving inside, the model&#8217;s 2+2 layout and racing-style bucket seats are the most eye-catching details.  In addition, there is a storage area situated between the rear seats, incorporating two practical foldaway trays.</p>

<p>Power comes from SEAT&#8217;s 240 PS 2.0 T FSI engine, which recently debuted in the new Leon Cupra, coupled to a six-speed manual gearbox.   With this potent engine, the Freetrack Prototype is a car that can satisfy many demands: it has the loading capacity and interior space of a family vehicle, the technology and capability of a 4x4, and the thrills and performance of a sports car.</p>

<p>The principal change is a chassis with 310 mm of ground clearance.  The Altea Freetrack Prototype measures 1,766 mm in total, making its angles of approach and departure and its ramp breakover angle those of a true off-roader: 26&#176;, 29&#176; and 23&#176; respectively.  The model&#8217;s width has also been increased by 60 mm, mainly to accommodate the imposing 255/50 tyres mounted on 8J x 19&#8221; wheels.</p>

<p>Plastic side guards with aluminium inserts, which protect the body against knocks from rocks and other obstacles, leave no doubt as to the robust nature of the Altea Freetrack Prototype.</p>

<p>At the front, there is an attention-grabbing exclusive bumper with square grille air intakes, a new feature compared with recent SEAT design.  The bumper itself is totally smooth with no moulding or edges, while the lower section incorporates two LED fog lights with aluminium casings.  </p>

<p>At the rear of the vehicle, the standout feature is the spare wheel which is fitted into the hatchback, covered with trim bearing the SEAT logo.  Two triangular-shaped tailpipes integrated into the bumper also catch the eye, while the tail lights are made with transparent glass.</p>

<p>Viewed side on, the impressive five-spoke 19&#8221; wheels really demand attention.  Plastic guards located on the lower part of the doors and over the wheelarches give the Altea Freetrack Prototype the undeniable air of a 4x4.  A further noteworthy element are the door mirrors, featuring integral indicator lamps, which are located on the doors and not on the A-pillars.</p>

<p>The Altea Freetrack Prototype has been designed to enable customers to enjoy the great outdoors and access areas which are out of reach of most vehicles.  A stunning panoramic tinted roof makes the most of the view, while also preventing too much sunlight from entering the cabin and overheating the interior.  The luggage rack, exclusive to this model, is also located on the roof.</p>

<p>One feature that cannot be missed is the colour used for the concept: an exclusive matt white finish, developed exclusively for this prototype.</p>

<p>The interior is truly luxurious, with two-tone brown and white leather upholstery, individual bucket seats, and front seats that can be electronically adjusted. </p>

<p>The centre console really catches the eye.  Two screens concentrate driving data in the upper section, including that for off-road driving, with air conditioning information in the lower section.  The air vents are a new design, exclusive to Freetrack.</p>

<p>The 2.0 T FSI engine's power is directed to the four wheels via a Haldex-type arrangement with a hydro-mechanical connection and electronic control, to ensure that the tractive force is distributed permanently in a progressive and precise manner.</p>

<p>As such, the Altea Freetrack Prototype represents the ideal solution for anyone who wants to explore the most challenging off-road terrain with the whole family, but is also looking for a high-performance car that allows them to enjoy on-road motoring to the full.</p>

<p>Timing</p>

<p>    * Launched initially in North America in 2008<br />
    * No current plans for introduction to Europe</p>

<p>Key facts</p>

<p>    * New Selective Catalytic Reduction system (SCR) reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 90 per cent, making it one of the cleanest diesel engines on the market<br />
    * Mated to the 3.0-litre V6 TDI 225 PS diesel engine<br />
    * The Touareg SCR meets the stringent emission limits set by several American states including California<br />
    * Euro IV standards dictate a NOx limit of 0.25 g/km &#8211; the Touareg equipped with SCR meets the 0.043 g/km US limit <br />
    * The system works to convert selectively nitrogen oxide into harmless nitrogen and water.  This conversion is made possible by spraying a film of AdBlue urea solution stored in an auxiliary tank into the exhaust stream before it reaches the new catalytic converter.  A reaction then occurs within the exhaust system to split the nitrogen oxide apart, the result being nitrogen and water.  The supply of AdBlue stored within the vehicle is such that it should not need to be replenished until the vehicle visits a retailer to be serviced<br />
    * The SCR system works in conjunction with a diesel particulate filter and a conventional catalytic converter to reduce emissions further<br />
    * New sensors within the engine&#8217;s combustion chamber monitor performance and adapt its characteristics to allow it to run more efficiently<br />
    * Although SCR is unique to the Touareg, a NOx trap will be fitted to the Jetta in the North American market from next year<br />
    * Touareg BlueTDI forms part of Volkswagen&#8217;s BlueMotion park exhibit at the Geneva Motor Show &#8211; highlighting current and future drivetrain and fuel technologies being developed by Volkswagen</p>

<p>    * Luxury brand synergy<br />
    * Sumptuous features provide exclusive ambiance<br />
    * Adventure and capability are integrated features</p>

<p>To coincide with the public world premiere of the 4007 at Geneva, Peugeot is unveiling a highly exclusive exercise in style produced in collaboration with luxury manufacturer Holland&amp;Holland, recognised for its spirit of adventure.</p>

<p>Exterior</p>

<p>The pearlescent Hag&#233;nias Bronze body colour paintwork combines harmoniously with the vehicle&#8217;s chrome detailing to accentuate the exclusive nature of this 4007 by emphasising its power and feline qualities combined with the presence of its style and &#8216;all-terrain&#8217; character.</p>

<p>Water-resistant leather features on the door mirror casings and roof bars, while the &#8220;Holland&amp;Holland&#8221; logo, the hood of a royal falcon, is applied to the rear quarter panels.</p>

<p>Large 20" alloy wheels, machined from a single block in a unique fourfold design, add presence to the vehicle&#8217;s exclusivity.</p>

<p>Interior</p>

<p>Only when you are in the vehicle does the creative alliance between the Peugeot Style Centre and Holland&amp;Holland teams become more apparent.  A blend of "Ebony" and "Chartreuse Green" leathers (Holland&amp;Holland colour codes) enhanced by smooth leather edging and original stitching, creates a natural, exclusive and innovative feel.</p>

<p>The leather trim covering the passenger compartment is entirely hand-crafted by leather craftsmen from the Peugeot Style Centre.  It blends harmoniously with the shape of the fascia panel, the special finish of the seats and the design of the door panels.</p>

<p>The Ebony wool felt floor and its embroidered carpets create a soft and warm environment.</p>

<p>Ruthenium styled parts in dark chrome reinforce the exclusivity of the vehicle, particularly around the console and drive mode selector (two-wheel drive, 4x4 or "lock" modes).</p>

<p>At the rear, behind the split tailgate which opens in two sections, a large boot concealing two retractable seats houses a fantastic luggage compartment specially made by Holland&amp;Holland.</p>

<p>Under the bonnet of this exclusive 4007 lies the 2.2-litre HDi engine developing a power of 115 kW (156 bhp) and a high torque of 380 Nm.  A Diesel Particulate Filter System (DPFS) is also included as standard. </p>

		LAND ROVER ANNOUNCES FIRST PROJECTS IN ITS CO2 OFFSET PROGRAMME		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	
<p>Geneva, 6 March 2007 &#8211; Land Rover today announced the first projects in its industry leading CO2 Offset Programme, which enables both Land Rover and its customers to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>It is the largest and most comprehensive programme of its kind ever undertaken by an automotive manufacturer and offsets emissions generated by Land Rover production operations in Britain and the first 45,000 miles vehicle use by UK customers.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal is CO2 neutrality with investments being made in renewable energy projects such as wind and solar, technology change and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>The first projects will include providing hydro-electric power to a remote area of Tajikistan and funding a wind farm in China. Together these projects will offset 150,000 tonnes of CO2 a year and bring social and environmental benefits to thousands of people. In addition, we are evaluating projects in Uganda, India, Turkey and the Dominican Republic. Details of these projects will be available once they are confirmed.</p>

<p>Phil Popham, Land Rover&#8217;s Managing Director, said, &#8220;We&#8217;re taking an integrated approach to help reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. We&#8217;ve cut emissions from our vehicles and are working on technologies, like hybrids, that will make even bigger reductions. These offset schemes will make a difference now and will be of real benefit to communities, the environment and wildlife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Projects<br />
Tajikistan &#8211; Installation of two hydro electricity generators supplied by naturally formed lake.</p>

<p>After the Soviet era diesel supplies to the region became intermittent. For the past 15 years residents of the city of Khorog have suffered intermittent power supplies. This project brings a reliable source of power and light to the region. Customers in the city are now able to keep warm and cook without wood fuel for the first time in many years during which 70% of the region&#8217;s trees have been cut for firewood. In addition schools and the local hospital will have a reliable energy supply. This project will offset 50,000 tonnes of CO2 a year.</p>

<p>China &#8211; Wind Energy Hebei Province (250 km north of Beijing)<br />
China is reputed to be commissioning a new coal fired power station every five days as the economy expands. Hebei province is one of the windiest in China and the project offsets nearly 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year.</p>

<p>Land Rover&#8217;s Carbon Dioxide Offset Programme<br />
The CO2 Offset Programme has been established specifically for Land Rover and supports a multi-billion euro investment by Ford Motor Company across its European operations to develop environmental technologies. Land Rover engineers are at the forefront of that development work.</p>

<p>The CO2 Offset Programme is run by Climate Care and overseen by an independent Board of Governance. Other offset schemes will be announced in due course.</p>

<p>    * Customers of all new Land Rover vehicles sold in the UK pay to offset the CO2 emissions produced by their vehicle, calculated on the certified CO2 emissions level for each Land Rover model up to 45,000 miles, typically three years use. The cost is from &#163;85 to &#163;165 depending on model.</p>

<p>    * New Land Rover vehicles all have lower emissions than predecessors in their model range. The all-new Freelander 2, for instance, has 11% less CO2 emissions in petrol form and the diesel version emits 5% less than the outgoing Freelander. The combined fuel cycle for Freelander 2 TD4 manual is 37.7 mpg (7.51 l/100km).</p>

<p>    * The new Range Rover TDV8 has performance figures to match the V8 petrol model but has 32% better fuel economy.</p>

<p>    * Emissions from Solihull have been cut by 30% since 1997.</p>

<p>    * The overall UK fleet average for Land Rover is 32 mpg (8.8 l/100km).</p>

<p>The Jeep brand is continuing its expansion into new territory with the European premiere of the new Jeep Patriot at the Geneva Motor Show this week.</p>

<p>The Jeep Patriot will be the new, entry-level price point for the Jeep brand in the UK when it launches this summer. Patriot combines the packaging and interior flexibility of an SUV with the performance, handling, fuel economy and price of a family hatchback.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert, Managing Director of Chrysler Group UK, said &#8220;You can&#8217;t escape the fact that the new Jeep Patriot looks like a classic Jeep &#8211; but there is nothing old-fashioned about the performance and fuel economy of this compact SUV or its state-of-the-art four-wheel drive system.</p>

<p>&#8220;The market place is changing and the Jeep brand is leading that change as the Compact SUV market grows. Our research shows that the Jeep Patriot appeals to younger customers that want more from their traditional family car &#8211; young families want a vehicle that looks different but still offers plenty of room and practicality, together with great performance and fuel economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Safety is also increasingly important for customers and the Jeep Patriot is loaded with many standard safety features, including side-curtain airbags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) with Electronic Roll Mitigation and the &#8216;Freedom Drive I&#8217; full-time, active four-wheel drive system, all of which add to Patriot&#8217;s tremendous value.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert added: &#8220;Small family cars with four-wheel drive systems are becoming more sought after as they offer better handling and enhanced safety on the road. The higher seating position of the Patriot, together with the new four-wheel drive system that automatically switches from front to four-wheel drive if you lose traction, offers drivers a real advantage in everyday driving conditions. The Patriot is as much at home on wet and icy tarmac as on mud, sand or snow and still manages to achieve a class-leading 43.5 mpg*.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two Jeep Patriot models, Patriot Sport and Patriot Limited, will be offered in the UK and will be priced below the Jeep Compass Limited model. The Patriot range will launch in the UK in July 2007 with a VW-sourced 138 bhp 2.0-litre six-speed manual diesel engine and a 168 bhp 2.4-litre petrol engine with a five-speed manual or a CVT automatic gearbox.</p>

<p>* 43.5 mpg on the combined cycle with the 2.0-litre diesel engine.</p>

<p>&#183;          Freelander 2 TD4 diesel automatic makes Geneva debut</p>

<p>&#183;          New Freelander 2 personalisation programme introduced</p>

<p>&#183;          Improved cabins in Discovery 3 and Range Rover Sport for 2008 model year</p>

<p>&#183;          Due to the continued success and demand for our new TDV8 and TDV6 diesel engines, the sale of naturally-aspirated petrol models will cease from 2008 model year</p>

<p>&#183;          The 2007 Defender &#8211; with new 2.4-litre common rail diesel engine</p>

<p>Gaydon, Warwickshire, 2 March 2007 &#8211; Following on from the most important period of product launch for Land Rover and another record sales year, Land Rover will show its all-new product line-up at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show.</p>

<p>Making its debut at the show is the Freelander 2 TD4 diesel automatic. Using the same six-speed automatic transmission as the 3.2-litre i6 petrol Freelander 2, the TD4 is powered by the all-new 160 PS 2.2-litre four-cylinder engine.</p>

<p>It has a combined average fuel consumption of 33.2 mpg and as with all Land Rovers, the carbon dioxide generated by Land Rover&#8217;s manufacturing activities and UK customers' vehicle use for the first 45,000 miles has been balanced through an industry leading offset programme run by Climate Care.</p>

<p>The automatic transmission features Land Rover&#8217;s CommandShift for manual sequential gearchanging and a sports mode for more spirited driving.</p>

<p>The Freelander 2 TD4 automatic goes on sale in the UK in April 2007, starting from &#163;22,305 on the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since sales of the diesel manual and i6 petrol model began in December 2006, demand for the Freelander 2 has been really encouraging,&#8221; commented John Edwards, Land Rover UK managing director.  &#8220;And it is already a multi-award winner, picking up the BBC Top Gear SUV of the Year and What Car? Best Compact 4x4 awards. A tremendous achievement.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the personal touch, Land Rover has also introduced an accessories programme for the Freelander 2.</p>
<div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/blogs/4x4newz/52396alr.jpg" alt="Landrover Freelander 2" title="Landrover Freelander 2" width="350" height="261"  align="left"/></div>
<p>&#8220;Land Rover has a long tradition of allowing customers to order vehicles to suit their needs but this new programme allows the greatest degree of personalisation ever offered to Freelander customers,&#8221; Edwards added. </p>

<p>The list of options includes: 19-inch sports wheels, a sports styling pack, Audio Connectivity Module (ACM) for iPod/MP3 connectivity, Rear Seat Entertainment (rear screens and DVD player), body colour mirror caps and sill strips, all shown at Geneva.</p>

<p>For 2008 model year, the Range Rover Sport &#8211; Land Rover&#8217;s best selling vehicle worldwide in 2006 &#8211; offers new refinements and subtle cabin enhancements. A new Ebony colour centre stack is standard, an improved Brunel metallic finish replaces the Rhodium finish and dark stained Zebrano is available as a new wood finish. A new tan premium leather upholstery colour is now available, with improved carpet mats and a stainless steel tread strip.  </p>

<p>8-way electric passenger seats and electric lumbar support adjustments for driver&#8217;s seats will be introduced on all top end SE and HSE spec vehicles and satellite navigation will become standard on all SE models.</p>

<p>The Discovery 3, winner of 95 international awards, is also upgraded for the 2008 model year.</p>

<p>For the first time, straight grain satin walnut or piano black wood finishes are available as standard on all HSE models, as are premium ruched leather seats, driver seat cushion pockets, eight-way passenger seat adjustment and powered lumbar support adjustment for the driver. Further upgrades across the model range include a more premium Ebony centre stack and centre floor console, &#8216;noble&#8217; plating finish to facia air vents and other controls and silver plated finish to the speaker bezels.</p>

<p>Due to the overwhelming demand for Land Rover&#8217;s efficient Discovery 3 TDV6, and the 32 per cent more economical Range Rover and Range Rover Sport TDV8 models, the sale of naturally-aspirated petrol models will cease from 2008 model year. This means that Land Rover's UK diesel sales look set to exceed 90 per cent of our total this year.</p>

<p>Last but by no means least, the significantly enhanced 2007 Defender completes the line-up on the Land Rover stand featuring a new 2.4-litre common rail diesel engine, six-speed gearbox with wide ratio spread, a fully integrated facia, new seating configuration and high output heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system.</p>

<p>Geneva Debut for the Audi Q7 4.2 TDI</p>

<p>326PS and 760 Nm of torque &#8211; Audi proudly presents the most powerful diesel SUV on the world market. A state-of-the-art eight-cylinder engine with common rail fuel injection and Piezo injectors not only stands out on account of its sheer output but also demonstrates outstanding efficiency: the 4.2 TDI achieves a combined fuel economy figure of 25.4mpg.</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 places the concentrated power of the V8 TDI, an engine with a displacement of 4.2 litres, into a vehicle concept that impresses with its versatile sportiness. Even at its debut, the Q7 model series set new standards in its segment. Now the 4.2 TDI is moving the bar even higher.</p>

<p>Under the bonnet of the new Audi Q7 4.2 TDI is the most powerful diesel engine the brand has to offer. The 4.2-litre capacity of the V8, which already powers the A8 luxury saloon, generates an output of 326PS and 760 Nm of torque at engine speeds between 1,800 to 2,500 rpm. The most powerful SUV on the market has the drivability of a sports car. The Audi Q7 accelerates from standstill to 62mph in 6.4 seconds and has a top speed of 146mph. These figures are also the new best marks in its segment.</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 4.2 TDI transmits its power through a six-speed tiptronic gearbox and a sportily tuned quattro driveline, which in normal situations splits propulsive force 40 percent to the front wheels and 60 percent to the rear axle. Audi's "adaptive air suspension" is standard on this most powerful of diesels &#8211; it unites dynamic handling with the ride comfort of the luxury class.</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 4.2 TDI is also at the top of the tree with its standard convenience equipment. The leather design package gives the interior a noble feel.</p>

<p>The electric tailgate makes lighter work of loading. A new feature is the</p>

<p>Audi lane assist system, which emits a pulse to inform the driver before he inadvertently crosses a line on the carriageway.</p>

<p>The engine: concentrated pulling power</p>

<p>Like all the engines in the Audi Q7 series, the 8-cylinder diesel heralds from Audi's new V-engine family. With a displacement of 4,134 cc, the large TDI has a maintenance-free chain drive on the gearbox side for its four camshafts and ancillaries. The angle between the cylinder banks is 90 degrees, the cylinder spacing 90 millimetres, the overall length just 520 millimetres. The crankcase is made of the high-tech material vermicular graphite cast iron. This forms the basis for the light weight of the engine &#8211; just 257 kilograms.</p>

<p>The V8 TDI is a masterpiece of engineering. The best examples: the crankshaft is forged from chrome-molybdenum alloy steel; the cylinders are of cast aluminium. Low-friction roller cam followers actuate the 32 valves; electronically actuated flaps give the intake air into a defined swirl.</p>

<p>Two turbochargers with variable-geometry turbines provide solid torque even at low engine speeds while still allowing a high power output. Large charge-air coolers reduce the temperature of the compressed air. The common rail fuel injection system contains compact Piezo inline injectors that are extremely precise and fast switching. They are capable of up to five injection sequences per working cycle.</p>

<p>The 4.2-litre TDI develops 326PS at 3,750 rpm. Between 1,800 and 2,500 rpm it induces its impressive pulling power onto the crankshaft &#8211; 760 Nm of torque. The most powerful diesel engine in the SUV segment gives the Audi Q7 the sportiest performance of all diesels. The premium SUV sprints from 0 to 62mph in just 6.4 seconds. On the motorway it can reach a top speed of 146mph.</p>

<p>The driveline: dynamic character</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 4.2 TDI is equipped as standard with the six-speed tiptronic automatic gearbox. The dynamic shift program (DSP) manages the gearshifts, whereby it orientates itself to the driver's style and to the characteristics of the road. A special sport programme &#8211; the S programme &#8211; supports a particularly dynamic driving style. The driver can intervene at any time, either at the gear gate for the selector lever or at the optional paddles on the steering wheel. As the tiptronic in the Audi Q7 was designed for high torque from the very outset, it does not need to be specially reinforced to team up with the V8 diesel engine.</p>

<p>Like all Audi Q7 models, the 4.2 TDI has a self-locking centre differential with asymmetric/dynamic torque split. In regular operation, it transmits the drive force with a ratio 40:60 to the front and rear axles respectively. If needed, torque is distributed at varying ratios between the front and read axles according to the level of grip: optimum traction is provided at all times. This ultramodern quattro technology provides for sporty characteristics reminiscent of a rear-wheel drive vehicle, for exceptional agility and for a steering precision that is to the greatest possible extent free of influences from the driveline.</p>

<p>The running gear: sporty performance</p>

<p>The running gear on the Audi Q7 4.2 TDI supports this dynamic presence. And it superbly masters all of these challenges &#8211; whether in rough terrain or on the road, where handling characteristics, driving safety and comfort set the standards. Adaptive air suspension, fitted as standard, rounds off the outstanding character &#8211; the combination of pneumatic suspension and electronically controlled damping with dynamic roll stabilisation forms the perfect synthesis of sportiness and maximum rolling comfort.</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 4.2 TDI driver can set the adaptive air suspension to any of three maps, from very sporty to very comfortable. In addition, the system allows five ground clearance settings. Up to 205 millimetres of air under the vehicle (offroad mode) is usually enough even on demanding terrain. The rear can be lowered by 71 mm for comfortable loading.</p>

<p>The Audi Q7 running gear is characterised by its high degree of sophistication. All four wheels are independently mounted on double wishbones. The axle components are made largely of aluminium. The servotronic steering is distinctively direct and precise, giving a feeling of excellent road contact. The Audi Q7 4.2 TDI runs on sporty 18-inch alloy wheels with size 255/55 tyres. Behind them, the four brake discs are internally ventilated and generously dimensioned &#8211; 350 millimetres in diameter on the front axle and 358 millimetres on the rear axle. The front brake callipers employ 6-piston technology, like on a top sports car.</p>

<p>The equipment: intelligent luxury</p>

<p>The leather design package is standard on the new Audi Q7 4.2 TDI. It includes inlays in three different types of wood or aluminium, and seat upholstery in Cricket leather. The front seats are electrically heated as standard. An on-board computer, cruise control system and multifunction steering wheel enhance comfort for the driver. The much-praised "MMI basic" control system is also fitted as standard. A practical tool is the electrically driven tailgate, whose opening angle can be programmed.</p>

<p>A range of assistance systems makes driving in Audi's performance SUV even safer.</p>

<p>A new technology that is enjoying its debut in the Audi Q7 4.2 TDI is Audi lane assist. It informs the driver if the lane is inadvertently left upwards of a speed of around 40mph. If the system is activated and the driver has not indicated, then shortly before the vehicle crosses the line marking, which is detected by Audi lane assist, the system alerts the driver by making the steering wheel vibrate (only in conjunction with the 4-spoke multifunction steering wheel).</p>

<p>Optional Audi adaptive cruise control is a radar-supported cruise control system incorporating active distance control. If required it can be combined with the "braking guard" brake assist system.</p>

<p>Audi's "side assist system" employs radar technology to monitor the blind spot and inform the driver if it is dangerous to change lanes. The "Audi parking system advanced" uses a camera for the view to the rear. The aid lines on the monitor make parking an enjoyable task.</p>

<p>Numerous interesting features are available for the dynamic lines of the exterior and for the spacious interior of the 5.09-metre-long Audi Q7: 21-inch wheels, the "open sky system" glass roof or the rail system for the generous luggage compartment, which has a capacity of up to 2,035 litres. A deluxe climate control system is standard. The seats are extremely variable. Like all Audi Q7 models, the 4.2 TDI is available as a 5, 6 or 7-seater. A 4-seater version will be available at a later date.</p>

<p>The new Audi Q7 4.2 TDI is scheduled to open for UK order in April, and first deliveries are expected in late June 2007.</p>

<p>World premiere of all-new European C-segment hatchback Hyundai i30</p>

<p>Hall 6 of the Palexpo fair grounds, on 6 March, at 17:00 hrs</p>

<p>Hyundai will reveal perhaps its most significant car to date &#8211; the all-new Hyundai i30 &#8211; at the Geneva Motor Show on Tuesday 6 March 2007.</p>

<p>Designed specifically for the European C-segment, the i30 will come with a choice of three gasoline and three diesel engines, combined with manual or automatic transmission, meaning it can meet virtually every driving, or powertrain preference.  With one of the longest wheelbases in its class, the i30 can also match above average occupant space with generous, easy access luggage capacity.</p>

<p>The i30&#8217;s styling is a continuation of the &#8220;wave-like and sculpted&#8221; design of the Arnejs concept car, shown at last year&#8217;s Paris Motor Show.  Flowing curves, emphasised by strong character lines, highlight the purposeful stance and long wheelbase of the car.</p>

<p>Thomas B&#252;rkle, Hyundai European Chief Designer, said: &#8220;The i30 offers dynamic and sporty styling, whilst retaining the chic and elegant touch of the Arnejs concept car.&#8221;</p>

<p>The i30 will go on sale across Europe in summer 2007. Initially available as a 5-door hatchback and later as an estate car, the i30 opens a new chapter for Hyundai in Europe, as it is the Korean manufacturer&#8217;s first dedicated European C-segment vehicle.<br />
New name signifies new thinking</p>

<p>The launch of i30 marks the start of a new global naming strategy for Hyundai models going forward.  While in the past, names have been chosen to express the values inherent in, or associated with, individual Hyundai models, Hyundai is now taking a more holistic approach to its nomenclature. The new alpha numeric names will display a clearer technology-orientation and be closely linked to Hyundai&#8217;s brand promise of &#8216;Quality, Self-assurance, and Inspiring&#8217;.</p>

<p>Full details of the new naming strategy will be revealed along with the car at Hyundai&#8217;s press conference at 5pm on 6 March in hall 6.<br />
Crossover Concept</p>

<p>Hyundai will also present a concept Crossover Utility Vehicle (CUV), code-named HED 4.  As a joint project with GE Plastics, the HED 4 endowed designers with greater expressive freedom to create complex three-dimensional shapes that could not have been achieved with conventional production methods and materials such as metal and glass.</p>

<p>Current composite technology is usually thought too expensive and too difficult to fabricate to be of use anywhere but the aerospace and motor racing industries. Hyundai&#8217;s CUV is physical proof that this need not be so.</p>

<p>The wrap-around GE Lexan&#8482; windscreen and extensive use of GE polycarbonate glazing materials provides a weight saving of up to 50 percent in relation to glass, while simultaneously allowing more adventurous shapes than flat glass. The glazing features a unique technology from Exatec&#8482; which deposits a thin protective layer of glass on the Lexan&#8482; to add protection from scratching and the effects of weathering.</p>

<p>The HED 4 also introduces new curved and moving side glazing in Lexan. As well as allowing such advanced applications, the impact resistance and other properties of this material also helps increase both occupant and pedestrian safety. Improving the latter is of utmost importance to Hyundai, due to its high percentage of European SUV sales.</p>

<p>HED 4&#8217;s Elastic Front&#8482; safety system, which encompasses the whole front end of the vehicle, is arguably the world's first global pedestrian protection solution on a CUV. Three energy-absorbing structures are fully integrated underneath the futuristic styling of the HED 4 and this system takes advantage of several advanced materials that offer inherent energy absorbing properties. The HED 4&#8217;s body panels have been designed to work in concert with energy-absorbing systems on the underside of these panels to manage and dissipate the force of a pedestrian/CUV collision. The Elastic Front&#8482; has been engineered to meet EEVC WG17 Phase2, Euro NCAP, and JNCA pedestrian impact requirements and is currently undergoing testing for final validation.</p>

<p>    * New Sc&#233;nic Conquest combines space and practicality of a compact MPV with more aggressive, rugged style of an SUV<br />
    * Revised chassis includes 20mm higher ride height and stiffened suspension - ideal for both city streets and country roads<br />
    * Choice of four engines - two diesel and two petrol, offering 106hp to 136hp<br />
    * Priced from &#163;16,765 to &#163;18,965<br />
    * Available to order from 1st June 2007</p>

<p>Never shy to explore new market territories, Renault is now gearing up for a new voyage of discovery with the launch of the Sc&#233;nic Conquest. Combining the space and practicality of a compact MPV with much of the look and driving benefits of an SUV, the new model will be available to order in the UK from 1st June 2007, with prices starting at only &#163;16,765, up to &#163;18,965.</p>

<p>Increased on-road ability<br />
Making its debut at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, Sc&#233;nic Conquest is a car aimed at a wide range of customers, including those with a passion for leisure pursuits and the great outdoors. The new addition to the Sc&#233;nic range is sure to have a broad appeal through its fusion of MPV practicality and low running costs, allied to the rugged look and greater on-road capability of an SUV.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be clear. Sc&#233;nic Conquest is not trying to be a 4x4 SUV with off-road ability, as Renault will launch an SUV in 2008 based on its Koleos Concept. Countryside dwellers using unmade or poorly maintained roads and city slickers tackling giant potholes and speed bumps need the raised driving position and ride height with stronger suspension, but not the 4x4 transmission that comes with an SUV.</p>

<p>Sc&#233;nic Conquest provides this increased level of on-road ability without the weight penalty, fuel economy reduction and CO 2 emission increase associated with SUVs. If you really don&#8217;t need four-wheel drive but like all the other abilities of an SUV then Sc&#233;nic Conquest could be the answer, especially as it costs several thousand pounds less than equivalent-sized and equipped SUVs like the Land Rover Freelander and Toyota RAV4.</p>

<p>Adventurous looks</p>

<p>You couldn&#8217;t mistake Sc&#233;nic Conquest for any other member of the Sc&#233;nic range. Conquest is front wheel drive, yet nevertheless, will be able to take the rough with the smooth as its chassis has been adapted to cope with life away from the beaten track.</p>

<p>At first glance, the most obvious sign of the Conquest's rugged nature is its 20mm higher ground clearance than a standard Sc&#233;nic. The car's taller stance should prove a boon for city dwellers tackling the urban jungle, as well as those who live in the country who would benefit from a better view of the road ahead when negotiating muddy tracks and B-roads with high hedgerows.</p>

<p>In addition to the increased ground clearance and twin skidplates protecting the underbody, the suspension has been modified to improve comfort on rough terrain. The front and rear dampers have an increased range of travel and smaller anti-roll bars have been fitted. Finally, the special settings of the ESP electronic stability programme and ASR traction control enhance Sc&#233;nic Conquest&#8217;s all-terrain character.</p>

<p>At the front, the lower part of the bumper has a protective black graphite coating while the radiator grille and air intake have been revised and a satin chrome-finish skidplate shields the engine. Making the Conquest even more distinguishable from other Sc&#233;nics, it features dark lens headlamp covers, 16&#8221; alloy sports wheels, while at the rear, the black graphite bumper incorporates a satin chrome-coloured skidplate.</p>

<p>Sc&#233;nic Conquest&#8217;s profile also reveals its fondness for off-road adventure or city parking through chunky rubbing strips which protect the side bodywork, while the wheel arch inners are protected by black graphite plastic and it also features robust door sill guards. Finished in chrome and black, the longitudinal roof bars are ideally suited to transporting outdoor leisure equipment.</p>

<p>Sc&#233;nic Conquest will be offered in a wide range of colours, one of which will be exclusive to this model &#8211; Cayenne Orange.</p>

<p>Subtle but distinctive interior</p>

<p>Inside Sc&#233;nic Conquest, splashes of orange differentiate the cabin from other Sc&#233;nics.  The dark grey centre console features orange graphics which echo the contours of a map and hint at the car's adventurous nature, while other unique touches include the blood-orange seatbelts and stitching for the gearlever gaiter and steering wheel. The carpets are also protected by Conquest-badged rubber mats.</p>

<p>Based on the best-selling Dynamique trim level, Sc&#233;nic Conquest costs &#163;550 more but adds extra equipment in the form of rear parking proximity sensors, ESP and roof bars, worth &#163;700 if bought separately. The parking sensors in particular should prove invaluable for urban driving and the school run, as well as avoiding trees and gateposts!</p>

<p>Adding a personal touch to Sc&#233;nic Conquest, Renault has developed bespoke accessories that can be purchased as a range of kits. They include an interior bike rack, additional storage units, guards for the door and boot sills, a compartmentalised boot box and so on.</p>

<p>A major factor in Scenic&#8217;s sales success is its interior versatility. All of its hallmarks remain in Conquest, such as the rear row of individual seats which can be slid forward, back, folded or removed completely, plus the numerous cabin stowage cubbies, rear aviation tables and underfloor storage, particularly as there is no 4x4 transmission taking up extra space. Customers can add even greater flexibility by specifying extras such as the opening tailgate window, panoramic glass sunroof and sliding centre storage unit. The Conquest will not be offered in Grand Sc&#233;nic guise.</p>

<p>Power to explore</p>

<p>Sc&#233;nic Conquest is available with a choice of two economical petrol and two diesel engines, ranging in power from 106hp to 136hp. All versions come with six-speed manual transmission as standard.</p>

<p>The entry-level petrol, 1.6 VVT, develops 111hp at 6,000rpm and 152Nm of torque at 4,250rpm, with combined cycle fuel consumption of 37.2 mpg. The more potent 2.0 16V petrol engine produces 136hp at 5,500rpm and 191Nm of torque at 3,750rpm. On a combined cycle, it returns fuel economy of 35.3 mpg. On the diesel side, the 106hp version of the 1.5 dCi diesel, generates peak power at 4,000rpm and 240Nm of torque at just 2,000rpm, returning 54.3 mpg on a combined cycle and emits CO2 of just 138 grams per kilometre. The second diesel option - 1.9 dCi 130hp offers maximum performance at 4,000rpm and 300Nm of torque at 2,000rpm. Offering a particularly wide power band, this engine sips fuel at a rate of just 47.1 mpg on a combined cycle and emits CO2 of 159 grams per kilometre.</p>

<p>Volvo strengthens its V and XC ranges at the Geneva Motor Show in March with the world premiere of two all-new premium estate cars, the Volvo V70 and the Volvo XC70, and the European premiere of the Volvo XC60 concept.</p>

<p>Following an exclusive pre-show sneak preview in Geneva on Monday 5 March1, the all-new Volvo V70 and the all-new Volvo XC70 will be revealed to the world on the Volvo stand on Tuesday 6 March.</p>

<p>The Volvo press conference takes place at 16.30 on Tuesday 6 March. Interviews with Volvo senior executives and the all-new V70 and XC70 project teams2 are available during both press days and can be booked in advance by contacting the Volvo UK press office.</p>

<p>All-new Volvo V70<br />
The all-new Volvo V70 redefines Volvo&#8217;s leadership of this segment and adds even more luxury, style and refinement than its predecessor. The all-new V70 also promises sharper handling and even better versatility (it&#8217;s longer, wider, taller and has a longer wheelbase) with 40-20-40 split folding rear seats, a wider opening tailgate and 60 litres of extra load space.  </p>

<p>All-new Volvo XC70<br />
Rugged and capable, the all-new Volvo XC70 has an individual style which combines AWD (All-Wheel Drive) technology and higher ground clearance with all the flexible, practical features of a traditional estate car.  More details will be released on Monday 5 March.</p>

<p>With a range of powerful 5 and 6 cylinder petrol and diesel engines, prices for both models will be announced in the summer and the cars will go on sale in the UK in September.  </p>

<p>Volvo XC60 concept<br />
Following its successful world debut in Detroit in January, the Volvo XC60 concept now hits Europe. This charismatic crossover vehicle integrates both the unmistakable, muscular XC-versatility and the sporty charisma of a coupe.  The production version of the XC60 concept will be in sale in the UK in spring 2009. </p>

		CITRO&#203;N&#8217;S C-CROSSER TO BE UNVEILED AT GENEVA MOTOR SHOW		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

Citro&#235;n&#8217;s bold, innovative and versatile C-Crosser is to make its World Show debut at the Geneva Motor Show next month.  Citro&#235;n&#8217;s first ever SUV will then go on sale in Europe later this summer.</p>

<p>With its strong styling, flexible 5+2 seating configuration, powerful yet environmentally friendly diesel engine (capable of virtually 40mpg on the combined cycle), together with its 4-wheel drive capability, the C-Crosser will complement Citro&#235;n&#8217;s range and offer a vehicle to appeal to drivers with a love of outdoor pursuits.</p>

<p>The C-Crosser&#8217;s exterior styling radiates vitality and robustness with the front of the vehicle dominated by the familiar Citro&#235;n chevrons that stretch across the multiple-ribbed bonnet to unite with the streamlined headlights. The chunky wheel arches, elegant chrome detailing and striking two-tone wheels further emphasise the C-Crosser&#8217;s muscular design. </p>

<p>Citro&#235;n&#8217;s impressive, new generation 156bhp 2.2HDi engine produces a massive 380Nm of torque at just 2,000rpm.  Mated to a six-speed manual gearbox, the engine has strong green credentials with its low fuel consumption, ultra-clean Diesel Particulate Filter System and ability to run on 30% bio-diesel.</p>

<p>To ensure an optimum blend of comfort, road holding and off-road capability, drivers have a choice of three transmission settings that can be changed depending on road conditions and driving style. Drivers can switch between two-wheel drive, electronically controlled four-wheel drive and a lock setting for low-grip conditions, all of which can be selected using a control mounted on the central console.</p>

<p>Occupants benefit from the versatile second and third row of seats, which feature an easy-to-use modular design allowing seating changes to be made quickly and effortlessly to provide a flat floor and vast load space. The vehicle&#8217;s generous dimensions offer comfortable passenger space, over 20 storage compartments and a large boot with a useful split-opening tailgate for easy loading.</p>

<p>This tailgate optimises the advantages of the flat boot space so heavy objects can simply slide in.  Opening in two sections, the lower part is able to support up to 200kg, allowing it to double up as an al fresco seat, perfect for owners with a love of outdoor pursuits.</p>

<p>To further enhance passenger comfort the C-Crosser offers a selection of optional hi-tech equipment, including a useful reversing camera which assists with manoeuvring and parking in tight spaces. Located above the number plate, the camera is automatically activated once the vehicle is shifted into reverse and the image is displayed on the smart navigation screen.</p>

<p>Citro&#235;n&#8217;s managing director Xavier Duchemin commented; &#8220;The C-Crosser will add a new dimension to the already diverse Citro&#235;n range and ensures that we have a vehicle to suit all our customer needs, whether it be an SUV, a compact MPV or a supermini.&#8221;</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s first horizontally-opposed turbo diesel engine &#8211; offering exceptional refinement and smoothness &#8211; makes it debut at the 77th Geneva International Motor Show next month on the Subaru stand.</p>

<p>The Japanese all-wheel drive specialist &#8211; renowned for producing cars with outstanding chassis dynamics and active safety &#8211; will be displaying an entire drivetrain at the &#8217;show.</p>

<p>Subaru believes passionately in its &#8216;boxer&#8217; engines which are more compact than in-line units and provide a much lower centre-of-gravity.</p>

<p>This reduces body roll for safer cornering and also enhances handling precision such as during a sudden lane-change manoeuvre on a motorway.</p>

<p>Due for its first vehicle application early next year, the Subaru &#8216;boxer&#8217; turbo diesel is a highly rigid unit with low levels of noise and vibration.</p>

<p>Not only does this eliminate the need for a balancer shaft which counters uneven combustion pressures and general roughness, but Subaru&#8217;s first diesel is as compact as its petrol sisters and combines unusually strong pulling power at low engine speeds with high-rev throttle-response.</p>

<p>Both the engine and symmetrical all-wheel drive drivetrain will be unveiled as part of Subaru&#8217;s press conference at the &#8217;show on March 6 at 10.15 am.</p>

<p>"Highlander holds a unique distinction within the Toyota brand and within the industry," said Don Esmond, TMS senior vice president, automotive operations. "Along with the 4Runner and the FJ Cruiser, it anchors one of the industry's only three-vehicle, mid-size SUV line-ups. Equally important, along with Prius and Camry Hybrid, it is a key component in the industry's only three-vehicle hybrid strategy."</p>

<p>The 2008 Highlander is significantly larger, roomier and more powerful than the vehicle it replaces. Yet its fuel efficiency will be virtually unchanged. It is noticeably quieter, smarter, with improved versatility and ride comfort. It will offer the highest level of standard safety equipment in a segment where safety is at the top of purchase considerations. And, it's all wrapped in a package designed for buyers who want to stand out and make a statement.</p>

<p>Highlander will have no equal to its comprehensive list of standard safety features. It will provide a segment-leading total of seven airbags, including a driver's knee airbag and roll-sensing side curtain airbags for all three rows.</p>

<p>As with all Toyota SUVs for the last three years, Highlander will provide Toyota's STAR safety system, featuring:<br />
&#8226; anti-lock brakes,<br />
&#8226; traction control,<br />
&#8226; electronic brake-force distribution,<br />
&#8226; brake assist,<br />
&#8226; and for the first time, enhanced vehicle stability control,<br />
&#8226; with electronic power steering.</p>

<p>On all models except the base models, it will provide a stand-alone backup camera with a multi-information screen, not tied to a navigation system. And, Highlander will have the distinction of being the first Toyota division vehicle to feature both active head restraints and a new hood and fender system designed to crumple on impact with a pedestrian.</p>

<p>On the outside, Highlander moves away from traditional SUV styling cues with a statement of strength instead of ruggedness; of intelligence over toughness. Calty Design Research in Newport Beach, Calif. sculpted clean, crisp lines, a wide, stable stance and muscular contours to give Highlander an advanced, contemporary, forceful and dynamic personality.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/08highlander_01.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="Toyota Highlander" /><br />
Highlander rides on an all-new chassis derived from the current Camry and Avalon. It is nearly four inches longer and three inches wider, with an inch more ground clearance and three inches of additional wheelbase.</p>

<p>Interior designers took full advantage of Highlander's substantial dimensions. Design intelligence is carried through to the refined interior, where smart and sophisticated blend with practical, flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>The passenger compartment is open and airy. Convenient and innovative interior features such as flexible seating arrangements, and ease of entry and exit, were directly related to customer input.</p>

<p>For example, Highlander's second-row features captain's chairs with armrests that, if needed, can be converted to a bench seat for three passengers. A "Center Stow" seat, when not in use, is hidden in a compartment under the front center console. In its place, passengers can easily snap in the provided center stow center console or choose to leave the area open as a walk-through to the third row. The second row also slides forward and back 4.7 inches and reclines.</p>

<p>Clever and convenient standard features include:<br />
&#8226; a third-row bench seat with foldable headrests for a flat rear cargo area,<br />
&#8226; a rear glass hatch for quick access to the back (optional on base grades),<br />
&#8226; and Smart Start and Entry for Limited and all hybrid models.</p>

<p>When Highlander arrives in July, it will be offered in Base, Sport and Limited grades. All three grades will be powered by a new 3.5-liter V6 that delivers an impressive 270 horsepower -- a 55 horsepower gain over the previous generation's 3.3-liter engine.</p>

<p>Two months later, the all-new Highlander Hybrid will arrive at dealerships. Offered in both Base and Limited grades, all Highlander hybrids will feature Toyota's advanced VDIM stability system. The system integrates:<br />
&#8226; full-time four-wheel drive with intelligence,<br />
&#8226; electronic brake and throttle control,<br />
&#8226; with true electronically-controlled active steering.</p>

<p>Highlander's advanced Hybrid Synergy Drive system has been extensively upgraded and refined for 2008 for both power and economy. The new Highlander gained about 500 pounds, growing significantly in every dimension and receiving extensive body and chassis reinforcement, aimed specifically at achieving best-in-class crash ratings. Not only were engineers able to increase output to 270 net horsepower, they were able to maintain Highlander Hybrid's impressive fuel economy at 31 city and 27 highway.</p>

<p>The Highlander will be loaded with standard-equipped comfort and convenience features. Nineteen-inch alloy wheels will be standard on both Sport and Limited gas models and both hybrid models.</p>

<p>An array of options and accessories will be offered, such as a power backdoor that can be opened and closed with a key fob, a navigation system with an eight-inch screen, a rear-seat entertainment system with a nine-inch screen, and three-zone air conditioning.</p>

<p>Other options include:<br />
&#8226; JBL audio with six-disc changer and nine speakers with Bluetooth,<br />
&#8226; third-row seat delete to create a second-row model,<br />
&#8226; leather seat trim and heated seats,<br />
&#8226; and a tow package with a 5000-lbs. maximum towing capacity (class-leading for car &amp; van-based mid SUVs).</p>

<p>"The 2008 Highlander takes the car-based SUV concept to a new level," said Esmond. "I say that with conviction, because it's a category we invented."</p>

<p>The Toyota RAV4, now in its third generation, was the world's-first car-based SUV. In 1998, Lexus established a whole new category of car-based luxury SUVs when it launched the RX300. The debut of Highlander in 2001 marked the beginning of a shift in the mid-size SUV segment, from truck platforms to car platforms.</p>

<p>"As you can see, the new Highlander has raised the bar significantly," said Esmond. "Last year we did the same with RAV4. And in about a year, we'll do the same with both Land Cruiser and Sequoia. The Toyota division now markets a six-vehicle SUV lineup that appeals to specific buyer demographics and life-stages. It is a lineup that gives us enormous flexibility in responding to shifts in the marketplace. We are committed to keeping our products fresh and at the front of the pack."</p>

	<p>In this video clip, learn how Jeep mounted their new Wrangler vertically to the wall. Internally, it&#8217;s known as the &#8220;Wall Jeep.&#8221; The new, four-door Wrangler had to be modified and lightened in order to hang on the wall safely. The engine and transmission are removed and the suspension is locked in place. Music lovers will notice the odd use of Wesley Willis at the end of the clip.</p>

DETROIT (Jan. 7, 2007) &#8211; Following a record setting sales trend and the successful launch of the all-new G sedan, Infiniti is keeping the momentum going with today's unveiling of the 2008 Infiniti QX full-size luxury sport utility vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.</p>

<p>With a new interior and refined exterior, Infiniti is enhancing and improving what customers already love about the QX &#8211; styling, technology, comfort &#8211; without compromising its towing capacity and interior roominess.</p>

<p>"Like the all-new G Sedan, the 2008 QX demonstrates Infiniti's philosophy of constantly evolving in the competitive luxury segment," said Mark Igo, vice president and general manager of Infiniti. "Despite being voted by consumers as top in its class in the J.D. Power and Associates 2006 Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout (APEAL) Study, we've given the new QX significant upgrades in the areas of interior design, performance, luxury features, and technology."</p>

<p>The new QX, which goes on sale at Infiniti retailers nationwide in April 2007, is the first major revision since it joined the luxury SUV scene in 2004 with a number of class-leading standard features. The exterior enhancements to the new QX include new front and rear fascias, new front fog lamps, new roof rack, standard 20-inch chromed aluminum-alloy wheels, and two new exterior colors &#8211; Lakeshore Slate and Serengeti Sand.</p>

<p>The QX's new interior is highlighted by a new instrument panel cluster design with Fine Vision electroluminescent instrumentation and a new genuine wood grain interior trim. Comfort and convenience is enhanced with a new 3rd-row power folding seat, standard heated steering wheel on the 4WD model, and a new stone interior.</p>

<p>Technological advancements include a new standard Premium Audio System with Bose&#174; Speakers, Burr-Brown Digital Audio Converter and 9.5-gigabyte Music Box hard drive and compact flash slot for playing MP3 files, Infiniti Navigation system and Intelligent Key.</p>

<p>Also available is an Infiniti Mobile Entertainment System with a larger screen (8.0 inches versus the previous 7.0), and a standard XM&#174; NavTraffic&#8482; system with real-time traffic information (requires active XM&#174; satellite radio subscription) &#8211; which allows drivers to chose the most efficient route to get to their destination.</p>

<p>The QX maintains its class-leading 2nd row roominess, go-anywhere ruggedness and the abundant power and up to 9,000-pound towing capability (when properly equipped) of the standard 320-horsepower DOHC 5.6-liter V8 engine.</p>

<p>Infiniti is keeping to its promise of delivering three new cars in thirteen months by introducing the next-generation Infiniti G Coupe and a new crossover sport utility concept at the 2007 New York International Auto Show in April.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>As a prime example of how the motorsport industry can help manufacturers build more environmentally friendly road cars, Xtrac, the specialist transmission technology company, will showcase the world's first commercially viable diesel-electric powertrain developed for a small family car at the Autosport International Show being staged at the NEC this week. </p>

<p>Xtrac&#8217;s experience of designing high-performance motorsport transmissions has resulted in a compact, mechanically efficient, fully integrated gearbox for the Zytek developed powertrain, which meets the programme&#8217;s low cost requirement for high volume series production.</p>

<p>The powertrain will form the centrepiece for a significant display of new transmission developments from Xtrac including its brand new 529 gearbox for sportscar racing, 516 gearbox for touring cars, and the transmission system developed for the JCB DIESELMAX land speed record.   The show runs from 11-12 January at the NEC, where the company will be exhibiting in Hall 19 on stand number E351. </p>

<p>The Zytek Xtrac hybrid showpiece fully meets the requirements of the Ultra Low Carbon Car Challenge.  This &#163;10m UK government initiative is aimed at producing an energy-efficient small family car with exceptionally low CO2 emissions of under 100g/km, equivalent to a fuel consumption of at least 75mpg (3.8l/100km). <br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/52042xtrac+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="xtrac hybrid powertrain" /><br />
Zytek&#8217;s novel solution is a dual-mode system which combines the high efficiency of series hybrids at low vehicle speeds with the high efficiency of parallel hybrids at high vehicle speeds.  It eliminates the compromises of other dual-mode hybrids by using sophisticated control strategies to replace clutches and complex epicyclic gearsets. The gearbox design and electronic controls allow the diesel engine and electric motors to be fully optimised for their function within the drivetrain.</p>

<p>Xtrac managing director Peter Digby commented: &#8220;This new and innovative hybrid driveline really does drive home the technological capabilities of the motorsport industry and its ability to deliver energy-efficient solutions to the mainstream automotive sector.&#8221;<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/52042-a-xtrac+.jpg" width="350" height="495" alt="xtrac hybrid powertrain" /><br />
Another highlight of the Xtrac display is the transmission system developed for the 350mph record breaking performance of the JCB DIESELMAX project, which smashed the diesel land speed record at Bonneville in August last year.  Xtrac supplied both gearboxes and differentials specified for the vehicle, which features two complete powertrain systems, one driving the front wheels and another driving the rear wheels. </p>

<p>&#8220;Within the demanding timescale for this project we took a derivative of our existing 427 sportscar transmission, packaged the automated clutch system from the JCB Fastrac vehicle and designed a bespoke differential assembly,&#8221; said technical director Adrian Moore.  &#8220;It was true concurrent engineering between Xtrac, Visioneering and JCB utilising our Unigraphics NX4 CAD system, without our motorsport approach I doubt the project could have been completed to schedule.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you can imagine, there was significant development work involved in synchronising the automated clutch and gear changes, which clearly had to occur simultaneously and with absolute precision,&#8221; said Moore.  &#8220;Any error whatsoever could have resulted in the gearboxes being in different gears, with potentially catastrophic consequences.  Our laboratory test rigs were fully deployed beforehand running both transmissions and control systems simultaneously to prove the system&#8217;s integrity before venturing onto the airfield and subsequently the salt flats, thereby ensuring the safest possible passage for driver Andy Green.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also on display is Xtrac&#8217;s new 529 series gearbox, which is suitable for LMP1, LMP2 and GT1 class vehicles, and recently entered production at the company&#8217;s UK facility at Thatcham in Berkshire in readiness for the 2007 race season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our new gearbox for endurance sports car racing is based on our Le Mans winning 229 transverse design, which has been one of the most reliable and successful gearboxes to be produced by Xtrac,&#8221; said development director Cliff Hawkins.  &#8220;In developing the new 529 gearbox, we deliberately specified a significant number of well proven carryover parts for optimum reliability, combined with technical improvements in a number of key areas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 529 gearbox is 3.4kg (7.5lb) lighter than its predecessor and its development has led to a narrower lightweight cluster, a revised gear-change rack &amp; pneumatic actuator, improved oil feed galleries and, for ease of maintenance, a side mounted alternator and rear mounted starter.  The new gearbox can fit inside the minimum diffuser size permitted by the latest Le Mans Prototype regulations without any modifications, and the narrow viscous-coupling plate differential permits longer driveshafts.  Options include a low loss bevel bearing for increased mechanical efficiency.</p>

<p>Another state-of-the-art racecar transmission being shown is Xtrac&#8217;s &#8216;516&#8217; front wheel drive gearbox developed for the World Touring Car Championship and other worldwide touring car championships.  Presented as a resin mock-up last year, the new transmission makes it to this year&#8217;s show as a fully finished production gearbox, which has already been delivered to the launch customer. </p>

<p>The new gearbox makes use of reduced centre distance F1 derived gear ratios to minimise its mass, size and inertia, and the complete transmission weighs just 30.5kg.  The gear-change system incorporates the latest polynomial barrel track design and a low inertia rack to improve gear-change response and driver feel.  The low positioning of the gear cluster lowers the centre of gravity and enables easy removal from the car under the chassis rail.  The gear cluster is fully exposed when removed from the gearbox allowing quick inspection and ease of access for ratio changes.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/52042-b-xtrac+.jpg" width="350" height="249" alt="xtrac hybrid powertrain" /><br />
Xtrac will also display its 6-speed synchromesh gearbox developed specifically for high performance supercars.  Intended for road use, such vehicles demand high levels of refinement and shift quality, which can be difficult to achieve with a bespoke design that may lack adequate engineering development because of ultra low volume budgetary constraints.  Xtrac&#8217;s solution is a highly refined &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; transverse transaxle system, which can be specified for virtually any supercar, and is the result of a major engineering development programme.  Its first application is the Brammo Rogue GT; the first 1,000 Nm V12 supercar designed and built in the USA. </p>

<p>Further demonstrating that the motorsport industry can work to very short timescales, Xtrac has already responded to feedback from customers attending the recent Professional Motorsport World exhibition in Cologne, with a new production ready endurance kit for its 406 gearbox.  Designed primarily for use in front wheel drive touring car applications, this transverse six-speed sequential racing gearbox is being used increasingly for longer races such as the VLN series in Germany.  The endurance kit upgrade helps preserve the 406 transmission&#8217;s renowned durability for these longer races, while maintaining its ease of servicing; ratio changes are accomplished on the bench after the ratio cluster has been removed as one unit on its cluster plate.  Value engineered to meet strict cost constraints, this gearbox offers the highest quality at a cost effective price.</p>

<p>Xtrac has also introduced recently a new range of specially developed lubricants. Working closely with the Neo Synthetic Oil Company, Xtrac has helped develop specific oils and greases from this American supplier tailored to meet the requirements of Xtrac&#8217;s high performance transmissions, limited slip differentials, driveshaft assemblies and hypoid axles. </p>

<p>The new XL1 synthetic oil is rated SAE 75W-90 and includes a newly developed additive to extend gear life and improve gearbox efficiency by reducing sliding friction, oil temperature and the impact of shock loads.  The oil&#8217;s characteristics include excellent low temperature viscosity and high temperature stability. </p>

<p>The new XG1 synthetic grease similarly minimises the impact of high shock loads typified by the high torque reversals and large speed variations generated by constant velocity and tripod joints in motorsport applications.  The grease also has bearing applications and is specified for uses involving high rolling contact.</p>

<p>Other products on display at the show underscore the breadth and depth of Xtrac&#8217;s experience in designing axles, differentials, gearboxes, steering rack-and-pinion components and systems, as well as other driveline components not only for the motorsport industry but increasingly for high performance applications in the aerospace, automotive, defence and marine sectors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Kia Motors America (KMA) has unveiled the all-new Kia Kue crossover concept vehicle at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, USA.  The V8-powered, all-wheel drive, high performance Kue is designed to deliver an exhilarating drive, in and out of town, on- and off-road.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>&#8220;In recent years Kia has instilled growing confidence and integrity in our customers&#8217; minds with vehicles that provide quality, value and safety,&#8221; said Len Hunt, executive vice president and COO of KMA.  &#8220;Now the Kia Kue embodies the next phase of our brand evolution, which will inspire pride and passion in our customers through its great design.&#8221;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The 4.7-metre long Kia Kue employs a different approach to the crossover utility vehicle segment by taking elements of what makes a great Crossover Utility Vehicle (CUV) to a new level, namely performance.  Kue is designed first and foremost as a driver&#8217;s vehicle.  While possessing many SUV characteristics and capabilities, the Kia Kue focuses more on giving the driver an exhilarating driving experience &#8211; on the open road and on the way to the DIY centre &#8211; rather than on how much it can carry.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Kia Kue has a monocoque platform that sits on giant 22-inch diameter wheels with a 2,900 mm wheelbase, packaged into an overall length of 4,724 mm.  Though purely a concept, the Kia Kue does, however, hint at future styling directions for Kia Motors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>&#8220;Good design shouldn&#8217;t look like you are trying too hard,&#8221; said Tom Kearns, KMA chief designer.  &#8220;The future Kia direction will incorporate the &#8216;less is more&#8217; philosophy but still include a heavy dose of boldness to be distinct.&#8221;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the inside, Kue continues the clean, athletic theme with bold understated simplicity.  With a four-seater interior arrangement and individual custom-built bucket seats, Kue is a vehicle both driver and passengers can enjoy.  A technology-driven interface designed to adjust to driver and passenger preference is the focus of the interior functions.  Touch pad and motion-sensing controls are used to adjust systems such as audio and climate control.  The entire touch-pad set up is programmable so that one surface may activate the stereo for one driver and temperature for another.  Rear passengers have their own, separate interface.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The generation-next functionality of the interior is complemented by the use of sophisticated seat and surface materials and a modern colour palette.  Carefully selected materials and textures are vital elements of the interior design of Kue and they create a luxury feel that is both modern and inviting.  A mid-dark interior theme with highlights was chosen in place of the typical light interior common to many concept cars.  Overall, the Kue interior presents a new perspective with an emphasis on comfortable, user-friendly interaction. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Just as inviting is Kue&#8217;s appeal to be driven in a sporty fashion.  Fitted with a 400 bhp DOHC, supercharged 4.6-litre V8 petrol engine that manages 400 lb ft (542 Nm) of torque, Kue is a true high performance vehicle.  Helping the driver harness all that power is a full-time all-wheel drive system yielding predictable driving characteristics both on- and off-road. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Developed by the KMA design team as an expression of Kia&#8217;s global design language, the Kia Kue is a true reflection of the Kia brand and the passion it embraces.  </p>

	<p>Veracruz Unites Space, Powerful Performance, Interior Elegance and Safety Satisfying the Most Demanding Customer<br />
Veracruz Unites Space, Powerful Performance, Interior Elegance and Safety Satisfying the Most Demanding Customer</p>

<p>DETROIT, Mich., January 8, 2007 &#8211; The new Veracruz midsize crossover made its North American debut today at the 2007 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). Just as the Hyundai Azera is altering perceptions about premium sedans, Veracruz breaks new ground in premium crossovers. Hyundai has once again made luxury and performance attainable in previously unthinkable ways: with standard Electronic Stability Control (ESC), upscale amenities and more cargo volume than the full-size Mercedes-Benz GL, Veracruz uniquely blends substance with style.<br />
Veracruz takes on the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander and beats them in terms of powertrain performance and standard safety features while adding sophisticated design, high-quality craftsmanship and seating for seven adults.<br />
"Veracruz is an exceptional vehicle at the right time for this developing segment," said Steve Wilhite, chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor America. "The vehicle's designers recognized that the needs and desires of traditional SUV buyers weren't being met and focused on meeting those needs in an elegant and ingenious way. The result is a spacious crossover that delivers both refined style and first-rate performance."</p>


<p>BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL<br />
The Veracruz continues Hyundai's product expansion and global design evolution through the continued use of fluid and organic forms to create a refined, and luxurious exterior appearance.<br />
"We are very proud of Veracruz and feel this design will not only reinforce our design direction as a company, but also greatly enhance our escalating brand image on a global basis," said Joel Piaskowski, chief designer at the Hyundai Design Center in Irvine, Calif. "Fluid lines combined with the integrated headlights and taillights envelop Veracruz to create a unified aesthetic."<br />
Up front, the sculpted bumper creates the appearance of additional height. Three-tiered headlights complement the design. The grille combines a flat-lined upper chrome bezel and a curved lower bezel which houses the Hyundai flying-H logo. Distinctive character lines and a fast profile enhance the stylish yet functional imagery. The vehicle's seductive beltline ascends from the wraparound headlights and follows the tapering greenhouse to include the prominent taillights. Chrome trim is strategically applied to highlight some of its design features while giving Veracruz an elegant, luxurious presence. The prominent wheel arches house 17- or 18-inch wheels and tires.<br />
Smooth and solid in its stance, the Veracruz even impresses as it departs. The integrated rear fascia has a sculpted section that blends seamlessly into the sides of the taillights. The taillights decisively angle towards the character line highlighting the rounded back glass. Dual chrome exhaust tips, a Hyundai design trademark, allow Veracruz's 3.8-liter V6 engine to breathe freely. A rear spoiler enhances the sporty profile.<br />

INTELLIGENT INTERIOR<br />
Inside, passengers are coddled in a rich, sophisticated environment that was inspired by boutique hotels. The result is an interior that could be found in the finest luxury sedans thanks to Hyundai's intelligent ergonomic engineering, intuitive design, and superior craftsmanship. Hyundai has combined space with elegance including conveniences that exceed expectations. For example, although the Veracruz is 9.7 inches shorter than the Mercedes Benz GL, it has more cargo volume.<br />
Every major component of Veracruz has been designed to reduce cabin noise below the whisper-quiet Lexus RX350. To isolate outside noise, Hyundai applies acoustic dampening sheets to the doors and unibody, a steel plate beneath the engine and four layers of carpet padding. Engine noise is reduced through electronically controlled engine mounts, a multi-curvature dash, custom hood insulation and a pillow tripod joint which lessens vibrations from the driveshaft at idle.<br />
Seating for seven adults is made possible thanks to the standard Hyundai Hideaway&#8482; third-row seat. Access to the third row is just a step away with the flip of a lever to slide the second row forward. Available dual-zone climate controls for driver and front-seat passenger further enhance the Veracruz's luxury credentials. Second- and third-row passengers will enjoy a new level of comfort, thanks to B pillar-mounted adjustable vents, rear HVAC controls and roof-mounted vents.<br />
Brushed metal accents and blue backlighting for all interior gauges, switches and buttons highlight the modern, integrated interior design. Even the front cupholders are ringed with blue light to aid nighttime driving, while a soft blue spotlight in the overhead console provides subdued task lighting. Hyundai's focused attention to detail can be seen throughout the interior &#8211; console bins and the glovebox are lined with soft flocking material. Powerpoint caps, seatbelt buckles and cupholder inserts are color-keyed for design harmony. Soft-touch, high-quality materials, low-gloss surfaces and zero-tolerance net-fits are used throughout the interior.<br />
An AM/FM/XM/CD/MP3 audio system that includes an internal amplifier and six speakers comes standard in the Veracruz GLS and SE. The 315-watt Infinity&#174; AM/FM/XM/CD-changer/MP3 audio system with subwoofer and external amplifier is standard on the Limited trim and optional in the SE. Audiophiles with even more demanding tastes will be impressed by the available Infinity AM/FM/XM/CD-changer audio system that includes a 605-watt external amplifer, 10 speakers and Logic 7&#174; surround sound available on the SE and Limited trim levels.<br />
Other thoughtful convenience features include a proximity key, rain-sensing wipers, auto dimming exterior mirrors, mirror-mounted approach lights, adjustable pedals, memory settings for the power mirrors, driver seat and steering wheel, backup warning system, power liftgate, and a rear-seat entertainment system that includes a DVD player and eight-inch overhead screen.</p>

<p>INNER POWER<br />
On the street, the new Veracruz has thrilling performance courtesy of the same 3.8-liter DOHC V6 engine that powers the Azera. It delivers an estimated 260 horsepower and 257 lb-ft. of torque. To maximize the power spread, the engine utilizes Continuously Variable Valve Timing (CVVT) on the intake valves and a Variable Intake System which helps cylinders breathe efficiently at both low and high RPM. The engine uses an aluminum block and cylinder heads for light weight and thermal efficiency, and features timing chains with no scheduled maintenance.<br />
To reduce vibration, the engine rides on newly developed semi-active engine mounts, which consist of three passive mounts integrated with a controllable element, rpm sensor and solenoid valve. The mounts harness engine vacuum to create a dynamic response which offsets engine vibrations. In fact, Veracruz has less idling vibration and noise than the Lexus RX350.<br />
To help put the power to use, the engine is mated to an Aisin six-speed gearbox with SHIFTRONIC&#174; manual control. The transmission offers silky smooth shifts and a wide spread of ratios that ideally suit the engine's capabilities. Drivers can access the SHIFTRONIC&#174; feature by moving the gear selector into a separate gate. Pushing the selector forward or pulling it rearward will shift the transmission up or down sequentially, adding to driver control. A clear LCD readout on the instrument panel shows the gear that's in use. The transmission uses an integrated transmission control unit and low noise gears which reduce friction.<br />
All of this powertrain technology is put to efficient use in the Veracruz, with an EPA highway fuel economy estimate of 25 miles per gallon, exceeding the smaller, less powerful Honda Pilot. Veracruz also delivers clean air, with an anticipated Ultra-Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) classification.</p>

<p>CHASSIS FEATURES<br />
Hyundai engineers benchmarked the best crossovers in the world before designing Veracruz's unibody and four-wheel independent suspension system. The rigid chassis and suspension geometry were specifically designed to deliver a supple, confident ride and help isolate the passenger cabin from imperfection in the road. The underpinnings are governed by a MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension system.<br />
Upfront, reverse L-shaped lower control arms and high caster angles provide superior steering feel and excellent straight-line stability. Large subframe bushings improve the ride and isolate unwanted noise, vibration and harshness. All four wheels are controlled by coil springs, fade-resistant, gas-charged dampers and front and rear stabilizer bars. The Veracruz GLS uses 17-inch, five split-spoke aluminum wheels and 245/65R17 tires, while the SE and Limited trims ride on 18-inch, five-spoke aluminum wheels and 245/60R18 tires. Add in rack-and-pinion power steering, with a tighter minimum turning radius than the shorter Lexus RX350 and Nissan Murano, and the end result is a vehicle with precise steering and handling, and a well-controlled yet comfortable ride.</p>

<p>ELECTRONIC ALL-WHEEL DRIVE<br />
Hyundai has added an Intelligent Torque Controlled Coupling All-Wheel Drive (AWD) system to propel Veracruz through the elements. Using wheel speed sensors to monitor the road and the driver, this electronic system can sense when and where more torque is required and route it there automatically. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels through a multi-plate clutch without any extra effort from the driver. An AWD lock mode can be engaged with the touch of a button providing a 50:50 torque ratio when needed.</p>

<p>SOPHISTICATED SAFETY SYSTEMS<br />
"The 2007 Veracruz embraces both active and passive safety with a host of leading-edge technologies," said John Krafcik, vice president of Strategic Planning and Product Development, Hyundai Motor America. "Electronic Stability Control, six airbags including side curtain airbags protecting all three rows, and active front head restraints are found standard in Veracruz and are some of the industry's most effective technologies."<br />
Veracruz's advanced engineering provides a high level of precision during all aspects of driving, and is anchored by standard Electronic Stability Control (ESC), the industry's most important new safety technology. By continually analyzing road speed, steering input, throttle position, lateral yaw rate and other factors, an onboard microprocessor determines if the vehicle is starting to understeer or oversteer, and automatically engages one or more brakes. The system also reduces engine output to help the driver maintain the intended path.<br />
In addition, Veracruz adds large four-wheel disc brakes with a 10-inch tandem brake booster and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) for impressive stopping distance for a vehicle of its size. Brake Assist maximizes braking force when an emergency stop is detected.<br />
Veracruz's passive safety features are equally impressive, beginning with six total airbags, including advanced dual front airbags, front seat-mounted side-impact airbags and roof-mounted side curtain airbags for all three rows of seating. In addition, active front head restraints help prevent whiplash. All seating positions feature three-point seatbelts, while the second and third row also have adjustable head restraints. Security is further provided through the standard alarm system and available engine immobilizer.<br />
To absorb impacts to the passenger cabin, Hyundai engineers optimize crumple zones and reinforce the architecture's rails, side sill frame, floor cross-members and center pillars. These reinforcements have been tested thoroughly in laboratory and computer simulations. Veracruz has been designed and tested to receive the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) top five-star crash test rating for front and side impacts.<br />
Convenient Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) points allow child seats to be secured in the second-row seats. Additional standard safety equipment includes a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), which alerts drivers if one or more tires are under inflated. An illuminated readout on the dash lets drivers know the exact tire needing inflation so corrective action can be taken.</p>

<p>THE DIFFERENCE IS IN THE DETAILS<br />
As with all Hyundai vehicles, Hyundai put a great deal of thought and attention to detail into every aspect of Veracruz. One touch opens and closes the available power tailgate, and the proximity key means no more fishing for keys with groceries in hand. Puddle lamps save your best pair of shoes. An integrated memory system returns the driver's seat to a default setting. Lining the rear bumper with rear distance warning sensors makes parallel parking a snap. Aerodynamic wiper blades improve visibility, and two-way nozzles, each with four streams of fluid, provide for remarkably clean windshields.</p>

<p>MODEL LINEUP<br />
The Hyundai Veracruz comes in three distinct trim levels: The well-equipped GLS, sporty SE and premium Limited.</p>

<p>VERACRUZ GLS<br />

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Chinese invasion of the US car market was widely predicted &#8211; but so far it hasn&#8217;t materialised, with manufacturers such as Chery and Geely backing off from plans announced by their US distributors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Neither showed up at Detroit this year, and nor did Landwind or Great Wall, two other Chinese firms that had a strong presence at last year&#8217;s Paris show.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But one Chinese manufacturer did make an appearance &#8211; Changfeng Motor drew a big crowd to announce its intention to begin exports to the US within the next couple of years, together with a number of new models, mainly SUVs and pick-ups.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a slightly comical presentation, the attendant media was treated to a &#8220;propaganda film&#8221; entitled &#8220;Developing through innovations in pursuit of the great&#8221;. Eat your heart out, Borat!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This gave details of the company&#8217;s history and impressive manufacturing capabilities, which have been built since 1996, when the company switched from the defence sector to car manufacture, though its presentation raised a few smiles as the voiceover man barked &#8220;Dragons are taking off! Cheetahs are leaping forward!&#8221; over a stirring oriental soundtrack of &#8216;Jerusalem&#8217;.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Changfeng&#8217;s chairman Li Jianxin said the company was the largest maker of SUVs in China. Most of its sales are of cars derived from Mitsubishi Shogun models, built under licence from Mitsubishi, though the company has sin e 2004 been building cars it designed itself as well. It&#8217;s a small company by Chinese standards, claiming to have a capacity to build 100,000 cars a year at three plants.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Its most significant launch at Detroit was a large SUV called the Liebao CS6, which was unveiled along with a small pick-up called the Feibao CT5. A much weirder concept was the Rhombus, which looks like two Reliant Robins joined together. This odd-ball car is a design study by a Chinese university which works closely with Changfeng.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The company already exports to other emerging markets in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, and while Li did not specify when US sales would start, he said one of the main reasons for coming to the Detroit Show was to forge links with suppliers and potential partners.</p>

	<p>CONCEPT DEBUT AT 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL AUTO SHOW</p>

<p>DETROIT (Jan. 7, 2007) &#8211; Nissan North America, Inc. (NNA) today unveiled two new vehicles at a press conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit &#8211; Nissan&#8217;s first entry into the small crossover SUV market, the 2008 Rogue, and an advanced design study, the Nissan Bevel Concept.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud to present two vehicles that exemplify Nissan&#8217;s synergies between design and production, between being current and staying current,&#8221; said Brad Bradshaw, senior vice president, sales and marketing, NNA.  &#8220;Our production model Rogue and our advanced Bevel Concept are built for the same active, enthused drivers, just at different stages of their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The all-new Nissan Rogue, with its balance of sleek functionality, aggressive styling and sporty performance, appeals to an untapped segment of the crossover SUV market, providing a vehicle that fulfills the functional needs of young, active drivers while still indulging in the emotional aspects of style and performance that allow these drivers to fully enjoy the driving experience.</p>

<p>The dramatic Bevel Concept was conceived at Nissan Design America, Inc. (NDA) in La Jolla, Calif. for the same driver, but at a different stage of life.  With its driver-centric interior that is more a workshop-on-wheels than a traditional SUV, the Bevel was created for &#8220;empty-nesters&#8221; who spend their new-found free time on hobbies, recreation and community service.</p>

<p>Brief overviews of the 2008 Nissan Rogue and Bevel concept follow.</p>

<p>2008 Nissan Rogue</p>

<p>The 2008 Nissan Rogue is built on Nissan&#8217;s &#8220;C&#8221; platform and mates Nissan&#8217;s QR25DE 2.5-litre DOHC 16-valve inline 4-cylinder (rated at 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft torque) to a standard Xtronic CVT&#228; (Continuously Variable Transmission) with available paddle shifters for sporty, efficient performance.  An all-new all-wheel drive system with yaw rate control is also available.</p>

<p>Every Rogue comes standard with Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) with Traction Control System (TCS), a responsive Electric Power-assisted Steering (EPS) system and 4-wheel disc brakes that feature an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake force Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist (BA).</p>

<p>Inside, Rogue offers a balance of sleek surface continuity and ultra-functionality, offering available leather-appointed seating, front heated seats and mirrors and steering wheel-mounted Bluetooth&#226; Hands-Free Phone System and audio controls.  Standard convenience features include a fold-flat front passenger seat, 60/40 split fold-down rear bench and oversized glove box with partition, while available features like a dual-level centre console storage with hidden functionality features, a hidden one-touch pop-up cargo organiser and removable easy-clean cargo tray add to the diverse utility of the new Rogue.</p>

<p>Among the advanced technology available on Rogue are an Intelligent Key, a powerful Bose&#174;-developed audio system with 7 speakers and subwoofer with MP3 capability and satellite radio, a Bluetooth&#174; Hands-Free Phone System, HomeLink&#174; Universal Transceiver garage door opener and Xenon headlights.</p>

<p>Standard safety features for the new Rogue include Zone Body Construction, Advanced Air Bag System (AABS) with dual stage front airbags and occupant classification system for the front passenger seat, and front seat Active Head Restraints. </p>

<p>Front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental airbags and roof-mounted curtain supplemental airbags (for front and rear outboard occupant head protection) with rollover detection are also standard.</p>

<p>The 2008 Rogue is expected to be priced starting around $20,000 when it goes on sale in autumn 2007.<br />
Nissan Bevel Concept</p>

<p>The Nissan Bevel Concept is a dynamic, multi-purpose vehicle that, unlike currently available sport utility vehicles or minivans that emphasise passenger needs and comfort, places its focus strictly on the primary user &#8211; male empty-nesters actively engaged in hobbies, recreation and community service.  Bevel offers unique, function-inspired asymmetrical styling, a high-utility three-zone interior and technology ranging from glass roof-mounted solar panels to drive-by-wire steering, throttle and braking.</p>

<p>Bevel&#8217;s exterior design begins with the two passenger-side doors, featuring a rear door hinged at the rear to provide an exceptionally wide door opening of nearly five-and-a-half feet.  Bevel&#8217;s tall one-piece rear hatch features a special horizontal hinge arrangement, with a height when raised of 6&#8217;2&#8221; from the ground.  With the hatch open, a special tailgate-like work platform folds down and snaps into place, creating a sturdy workbench-like area.</p>

<p>Bevel features a pair of power outlets &#8211; a traditional 12V outlet and a 110V power tool recharging outlet, which is powered by Bevel&#8217;s integrated solar cells mounted beneath the large glass roof panels.  Bevel also utilises a unique roof cargo system designed to carry loads up to 250 pound and featuring six hexagon-shaped &#8220;pucks&#8221; with pop-up hooks.</p>

<p>Bevel&#8217;s interior combines comfort, utility and technology.  The driver&#8217;s area includes a comfortable, rich leather-appointed fixed seat and Bevel&#8217;s unique &#8220;ribbon&#8221; instrument panel, which moves four inches forward and back when the driver&#8217;s door is opened or closed. </p>

<p>The &#8220;command central&#8221; information/technology zone features a series of screens that<br />
display images from the sideview mirror cameras and five information menus &#8211; Vehicle<br />
Information, HVAC, Navigation, Entertainment and Home &#8211; through use of the ribbon-mounted controller.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Entertainment&#8221; control centre allows the driver to access phone settings, weather and traffic reports, Internet and personal e-mail accounts, and music, while also allowing the driver to access a home network and monitor locks and security system, heat and air conditioning, appliance, room lighting and garage door status.  </p>

<p>Bevel&#8217;s utility/pet zone provides maximum cargo space through the use of fold-flat front passenger and rear bench seating that creates a smooth, continuous cargo floor/work area.  The flooring itself is constructed from laminated recycled walnut, creating an extremely hard, workbench-like surface.</p>

<p>Bevel provides unique accommodation for pets, including a 360-degree pet leash swivel connection point and a large, removable &#8220;doggie hutch&#8221; pet carrier designed to fit securely in the rear cargo area.</p>

<p>Conceptually, Bevel would feature a small, efficient 2.5-litre V6 with HEV, combining driving pleasure with environmentally friendly design.</p>

<p>In North America, Nissan's operations include automotive styling, engineering, consumer and corporate financing, sales and marketing, distribution and manufacturing.

<p> </p>

<p>Volvo unveiled its compact XC60 SUV, and bosses of Ford&#8217;s Swedish luxury brand said the car signalled the start of a more &#8220;pumped-up&#8221; look for the company&#8217;s cars.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Volvo Cars design director Steve Mattin said the car contained &#8220;the DNA of future Volvos&#8221;. He added: &#8220;We&#8217;re about to elevate Volvo&#8217;s DNA to new levels by pumping up the volume.&#8221; This involves a bolder interpretation of the Volvo grille, with a large logo across the diagonal band, plus a more distinctive rear end with VOLVO spelled out in large letters and an innovative split tailgate that refines the one fitted to the C30 hatchback.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/080107-2-dms+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Voolvo XC60" align="left" /></p>

<p>&#8220;If you can recognise a Volvo from 50 metres today, I want to get to the point where people will be able to spot one from twice the distance in the future,&#8221; Mattin added.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Indeed, Volvo Car president Fredrik Arp added that the XC60 would likely be &#8220;the C30 owner&#8217;s next car&#8221;. Production versions will externally be very similar to the concept, though it remains to be seen whether the radical interior &#8211; most of the dashboard is a white &#8220;wall of ice&#8221; screen which conceals warning lights and driver information until the ignition is switched on. Mattin said it was designed to be like &#8220;a giant iPod&#8221;.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Arp stressed that traditional Volvo safety aspects would not be overlooked on the car &#8211; a low-speed adaptive braking system called City Safety is fitted, which prevents the XC60 from running into the car in front at low speeds. Volvo&#8217;s 3.-litre 6-cylinder flex-fuel engine, which allows ethanol to be used instead of petrol, will also be fitted, cutting emissions by up to 80%, Arp added.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The XC60 enters one of the fastest-growing sectors of the market, the compact premium SUV sector. In the next two years, this segment&#8217;s global sales volume is expected to grow by 75% to 443,000 cars, Arp said.</p>

	<p>KUE TO BE SEEN AT DETROIT MOTOR SHOW 2007<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51916kia+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="Kia Kue" align="left" /><br />
 </p>

<p>Kia has released a design sketch of its newest concept car &#8211; Kue.  The Crossover Utility Vehicle (CUV) will be revealed at the upcoming North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With distinctly grand SUV styling, the Kue majors on greater driving dynamics and performance.  The focus is very much about an exciting driving experience, as opposed to the typical SUV or CUV lifestyle.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Kue is based around a dynamically focused monocoque chassis and features bold seven-spoke 22-inch alloy wheels.  Size wise, the Kue measures up with an overall length of 4,720mm and a 2,900mm wheelbase.  This compares to 4,810mm and 2,890mm for Sedona and 4,590 and 2,710 for Sorento.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although Kue will be presented at the Detroit show as a pure concept, it will present a number of strong styling indicators to the direction of Kia&#8217;s future models.  The doors feature a distinctive, yet familiar, sill-to-waist door crease which can be clearly seen on the all new cee&#8217;d &#8211; the first Kia to be designed and built in Europe.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Kue will be unveiled at the NAIAS in Detroit in January 2007.</p>

	<p>Exclusive STARTECH Accessories for the Jeep Compass</p>

<p>The Jeep Compass has arrived and in time for the market introduction of the new compact SUV<br />
STARTECH already offers an exclusive customization program<br />
and powerful performance tuning for the turbodiesel model.</p>

<p>The STARTECH SD3 performance kit for the diesel model consists of an auxiliary module that<br />
modifies the engine electronics. With it maximum power output of grows from stock 140 hp / 103<br />
kW to 180 hp / 132 kW. At the same time peak torque increases to 360 Nm between 1,750 and<br />
2.500 rpm.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/starech_compass_01.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Startech Jeep Compass" align="right" /><br />
As an optimal complement to the STARTECH SD3 power kit there is the STARTECH sport<br />
exhausts system with a large oval chrome tailpipe on either side. The fully stainless-steel precise-<br />
fit exhaust is available for all engine variants of the Compass, and lends the Jeep a more thrilling<br />
exhaust note.</p>

<p>For customizing the exterior STARTECH offers a custom-tailored designer suit. In the front the<br />
Compass gets a new face with the STARTECH front fascia. Retaining the original mounting points<br />
means easy installation and optimal precise fit.</p>

<p>The sides of the five-door are refined by elegant STARTECH rocker panels that serve as running<br />
boards. The rear of the Jeep is modified with an element that attaches to the rear bumper. It<br />
features integrated cutouts for the STARTECH sport exhaust.</p>

<p>'20-inch diameter instead of the 18-inch stock wheels' is the motto of the exclusive STARTECH<br />
tire/wheel combination for the Compass. The Monostar IV five-spoke wheels are silver polished<br />
and in size 9Jx20 with size 245/35 R 20 tires they fill out the wheel houses nicely.</p>

<p>STARTECH also offers progressive-rate springs that lower the ride height of the American SUV by<br />
some 30 millimeters. The lowered center of gravity gives the Jeep sportier and even safer handling<br />
characteristics.</p>

<p>STARTECH also adds exclusive and individual interior highlights. These include stainless-steel<br />
door sills with illuminated STARTECH logo, high-quality velour floor mats and the STARTECH<br />
Lifestyle interior upgrade package that gives the entire Compass cockpit a more elegant<br />
appearance.</p>

		TOUGH COMPACT HCD10 Hyundai hellion Concept Debuts at Los Angeles Auto Show		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>LOS ANGELES, November 29, 2006 &#8211; The Hyundai Design and Technical Center and Hyundai Motor America presented the world debut of the HCD10 Hyundai Hellion concept during a press conference at the Los Angeles Auto Show today. Hellion is a compact three-door sport crossover designed with attitude and independence creating its unmistakable character.<br />
"The HCD10 Hyundai Hellion was designed to appeal to a diverse individualist customer," said Joel Piaskowski, chief designer at the Hyundai Design Center. "Mindset and attitude are becoming the modern way to define new market segments and we feel the Hellion concept will do that. Hellion brings a new attitude to the Hyundai family. It's the sibling who's a bit mischievous and always outspoken."<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/hyundai_hellion---02.jpg" width="449" height="299" alt="Hyundai Hellion" align="right" /><br />
ARCHITECHTURE<br />
Hellion's architecture was inspired by a tough, hardshell backpack that uses ribs to provide structural and visual strength. To support this, Hyundai used three ultra-lightweight structural ribs to create Hellion's safety cage. These ribs connect to a suspended surfboard-shaped spine. Hellion's ribcage not only provides protection for its occupants, but also adds visual rigidity and shape. By stretching the sheet metal skin away from the common body surface, the ribs give Hellion a new kind of organic ruggedness.</p>

<p>EXTERIOR DESIGN<br />
"The proportions of the HCD10 Hyundai Hellion make it look and feel tough," said Marc Mainville, senior designer at the Hyundai Design Center. "Short overhangs allow for excellent attack angles for off-roading and the skid plates, muscular wheel flares and tow hooks convey Hellion's strength."</p>

<p>The Hyundai Hellion's front design explores how new organic structural forms could look on future Hyundai trucks. Hellion's stance is wide and its face is assertive, with piercing headlights angled towards its dominant grille. A prominent hood scoop enhances Hellion's rally car demeanor while the clamshell hood utilizes exposed latches for easy access to the engine bay. The windshield's fast rake provides a very sporty character to an otherwise stout profile. Front and rear bumpers are distinguished from the organic body shape with a darker, durable wrinkle-finish paint supported by functional aluminum skid plates that wrap underneath the vehicle.</p>

<p>The rear of the Hellion continues the bold design theme. Hellion's taillights emphasize the tapering of the greenhouse and the wide sculpture of the wheel flares by being cantilevered off the rear quarter glass. Dual chrome exhaust tips are fitted between the bumper and skid plate to complete the integrated appearance.</p>

<p>A removable canvas soft-top roof adds to the independent spirit of the Hyundai Hellion. The roof's fabric has a subtle abstracted camouflage pattern, but any pattern can be requested by the customer to personalize their vehicle. The exterior is finished in a Dakar Gold paint scheme recognizing the famous Rally Race and its influence on the design. The 20-inch aluminum wheels are constructed in two pieces and are Teflon&#174;-coated to resist build-up of the elements.</p>

<p>INTERIOR DESIGN<br />
Hellion's efficient, two-box design and three-door package gives the driver and passengers a tidy, functional environment from which to navigate.<br />
"The HCD10 Hyundai Hellion has a consistent design theme unifying the interior and exterior resulting in a very cohesive concept car," said Martin Frost, senior designer at the Hyundai Design Center. "The exterior is reflected throughout the interior with stretched surfaces creating interesting negative forms contributing to the perception of space."</p>

<p>The ribs on the exterior are evident on the interior as they grow from the side panels to encapsulate the occupants and suspend an overhead console running the length of the interior. The console houses integrated interior lighting and a drop-down LCD monitor for rear-seat entertainment.<br />
The customizable camouflage pattern used on the exterior of the removable roof has been scaled down and trimmed as accent panels on the four race-inspired bucket seats. The interior is composed of glossy white accents and matte aluminum details contrasting with the black Desert Night interior giving Hellion a crisp, modern look.</p>

<p>The HCD10 Hyundai Hellion's compact exterior appearance belies its abundant interior space. Inventive cargo and storage spaces make the Hellion gear-ready. The seat-mounted gear packs transform into fully functional backpacks via push-button releases, allowing drivers and passengers to continue their adventures on foot. In addition, convenient hideaway drawers push out from the front of each seat. Storage is also found along the center console and there are two lids with translucent strips for easy access to belongings.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/asset_upload_file159_2062-1.jpg" width="450" height="281" alt="Hyundai Hellion - Interior" align="left" /><br />
The Hyundai Hellion includes extras that will help drivers take on rugged driving conditions while providing necessary amenities to keep the driver and passengers nestled in relative comfort. As an example, the bucket seats are equipped with a unique hydration system. A removable, refillable reservoir inside each seat replaces the common cupholder. The fluids are accessed by a pump-assisted flow tube that is attached to each seat allowing the individual to hydrate with ease. This hands-free hydration system allows the driver and passengers to focus on the road and scenery.</p>

<p>The instrument panel-mounted information display indicates the status of all in- car systems. Immediate control over climate and audio functions are facilitated via the control panel directly below the monitor. Navigation and more involved instructions are directed through the console-mounted mouse.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE<br />
Performance had to equal the outspoken styling, so the Hyundai Hellion has been outfitted with an eco-friendly 3.0-liter V6 Common-rail Diesel engine (CRDi) with 236 horsepower and 332 lb.-ft. torque. The engine is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission to fit Hellion's performance demands. The Hellion also comes with 4WD, further underscoring the capability aspects of this CUV.</p>

<p>technology<br />
The HCD10 Hyundai Hellion is equipped with next-generation technology including:<br />
&#8226; Electronic Stability Control<br />
&#8226; Shift-by-Wire Transmission<br />
&#8226; Wireless Internet<br />
&#8226; Navigation<br />
&#8226; Adaptive Cruise Control</p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Ford Escape Hybrid continues to be a "full" hybrid. This means that, unlike other "mild" hybrid vehicles, Escape Hybrid can run on 100 percent electric power up to about 30 mph, maximizing in-city fuel economy.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/08escape_hyb_01.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Ford Escape Hybrid" align="left" /><br />
At low speeds, power is delivered by a permanent magnet AC synchronous electric motor, producing 70 kw @ 5,000 rpm and 330V maximum voltage. When additional power is required, the Escape Hybrid's 2.3-liter DOHC 16-valve Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine seamlessly engages, contributing 133 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 124 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,250 rpm. The net result is 155 horsepower with 0-60 times comparable to a 200 horsepower V-6 engine and a boost in city-driving fuel economy of nearly 75 percent. Escape Hybrids are equipped with a smooth-shifting, electronically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). .</p>

<p>For 2008, Escape Hybrid engineers made revisions to software in the control system to improve transparency, or the transition between gasoline and electric operation. The transition from all-electric to gasoline power to a combination of the two is now even more seamless and virtually imperceptible to the driver.</p>

		CONCEPT TIGUAN MAKES WORLD DEBUT AT LOS ANGELES AUTO SHOW		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/281106-b-vw+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="Volkswagen Tiguan" align="right" />Volkswagen has unveiled its compact 4x4, the Concept Tiguan, at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and has announced that the first examples of the SUV will be delivered to customers by the end of next year.</p>

<p>The first news of the Tiguan&#8217;s development came with the debut of Concept A in Berlin earlier this year.  This was followed by the naming of the model in July, the result of a poll of more than 350,000 readers of magazines of the AutoBild group.  This latest development in Los Angeles takes the Tiguan one step closer to production and hints strongly at how the final version could look.</p>

<p>Maintaining the &#8216;baby Touareg&#8217; appearance of the Concept A, Concept Tiguan makes a bold styling statement.  At 4.4 metres long, 1.85 m wide and 1.69 m high, it is very similar in size to the Touran compact MPV (4.4 m, 1.8 m, 1.6 m).  Klaus Bischoff, who was responsible for the exterior design of the car said: &#8216;It was very important for us to have the car appear powerful and muscular.  For us that was a higher priority than anything else.  An off-roader needs a long hood and an upright position.  That lends the vehicle self-assuredness and power.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Concept Tiguan&#8217;s &#8216;face&#8217; and side profile are immediately recognisable as those of a Volkswagen, and yet they are different from all existing models in the range.  The dark-anodised metallic tone of the front grille contrasts with the body colour, while a grid pattern and two dominant cross fins to the left and right of the Volkswagen roundel complete the look. </p>

<p>Another feature is the Concept Tiguan&#8217;s tyre design.  These 19-inch prototypes, developed by Continental, have an orange radial stripe beneath the tyre profile which matches the car&#8217;s paint colour.  This colour is not simply painted on: it penetrates the rubber layer as a &#8216;baked in&#8217; component of the tyre&#8217;s casing.  The eye-catching anthracite-coloured alloy rims are likely to feature in the production vehicle.</p>

<p>At the rear, the lights are integrated into the shoulder section similar to those on the Eos and Passat, while the steeply sloping tailgate extends right down to the bumpers, giving the Tiguan an unmistakably SUV design. <br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/281106-a-vw+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="Volkswagen Tiguan" align="left" /><br />
Inside the Concept Tiguan, the black, silver and orange colour theme continues.  The vintage style black leather seats are trimmed with an orange pattern which mirrors that of the tyre tread.  A panoramic sunroof adds light to the spacious interior which can seat up to five occupants, while to add versatility, the rear bench seat can slide fore and aft and be folded down to increase loadspace.  </p>

<p>Under the bonnet, the concept car features a completely new type of diesel engine, called BLUETEC.  Developed in partnership with Audi and Mercedes-Benz and presented for the first time at the LA show, BLUETEC employs a modular concept of different systems to reduce emissions significantly.  One of these systems is the NOx storage catalytic converter which cuts nitrogen oxides by up to 90 per cent over current diesel units.  This &#8216;Clean TDI&#8217; will comply with the strictest emissions standards in the world and is one of the first components of the BLUETEC offensive.</p>

<p>More details on the Tiguan will be revealed in the first quarter of 2007.  The car will go on sale in the UK early in 2008. </p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Among the many showstoppers General Motors has planned for the North American International Auto Show in January, its military-inspired off-road brand HUMMER will be unveiling an H4 concept. The oft rumored H4 will be smaller than the successful H3 SUV that's currently driving HUMMER sales and will be slated to compete with the Jeep Wrangler. While the H3 is built on the same platform as the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-size pickups, we don't yet know what will underpin the H3. AutoWeek sources confirm, however, that it will not be built on a front-wheel drive platform. With the success of the H3 worldwide continuing unabated despite the fluctuation of fuel prices, the decision to produce the H4 concept should be an easy one for General Motors. Expect a version suitable for mass market consumption around 2010. HUMMER will also have a pickup version of the H3 on display at the Detroit show. With two new potential vehicles on deck, HUMMER appears ready to carve as large a niche for itself as possible out of the remaining pool of off-road warriors.</p>

		LAND ROVER enthusiast show moving to Kelmarsh		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>A message from Richard Green, publisher of Land Rover enthusiast magazine and organizer of The Land Rover enthusiast show at Kelmarsh Hall (previously at Billing Aquadrome).</p>

<p>I have for the last 16 years helped organise the Land Rover Show at Billing Aquadrome, with the help of about 100 managers, friends and marshals.</p>

<p>After the 2006 show, we decided that there was no future for a big Land Rover show at Billing. Since the first show in 1991, the space available for the show has been reduced by about half, as Billing put in more and more residential units, and now they are putting in log cabins as well. This made camping very difficult for late comers even though we only booked in the number we had agreed with Billing.</p>

<p>In recent years very little investment has been made in the touring area that we used for the show and the facilities and the ground have been neglected, and very little maintenance work appears to have been done, including to the trees. In spite of repeated promised improvements from Billing, nothing much was ever done and the level of service in 2006 was worse than usual especially toilets, general cleaning and security.</p>

<p>Billing appear to have planning permission to develop the funfair area which will probably mean its demolition and rebuilding and possibly restriction of car parking places, causing disruption over a long period.</p>

<p>We were unable to obtain any commitment from Billing on any improvements that we thought necessary for 2007.</p>

<p>We were also asked to move the show forward a week to the second week in July when all the children would have been at school, causing reduced visitor numbers.</p>

<p>We were asked to move the trade stand area to the events field, which we though was unnecessary.</p>

<p>We were asked to pay a substantially increased rent and money was demanded also from the farmer who&#8217;s off road course we used.</p>

<p>We were offered a &#8220;take it or leave it&#8221; agreement which we could not accept. It appeared that Billing&#8217;s attitude was &#8220;why bother with the aggravation that goes with a big show when we can make as much money selling a few caravans over the weekend&#8221;.</p>

<p>We thought there would be insufficient space for a show in 2007 and it would probably be much worse in 2008 when Land Rover celebrates its 60th anniversary &#8211; remember the bumper turnout for 1998, the 50th Anniversary. You cannot get a quart into a pint pot.</p>

<p>For all these reasons we decided, reluctantly, that we had to move the show we had organised so successfully for 16 years and we chose Kelmarsh Hall, about 15 miles north of Billing. The staff there has made us most welcome and is helping us set up what is still likely to be the biggest Land Rover Show of the year.</p>

<p>There is space for expansion, unlike Billing, and already Kelmarsh Hall has staged Game Fairs, Country Fairs, English Heritage events, the Rolls Royce Club show and many others, including some that have moved from Billing. Some of these events have had many more visitors than ever attended the Land Rover Show at Billing.</p>

<p>We believe that we made the right choice and already have taken bookings from most of the biggest trade stands. We expect many more to book over the next few weeks. We also expect most of the major clubs to attend.</p>

<p>Nobody likes change, but sometimes there is no choice. We look forward to organising the biggest Land Rover Show in the world, now at Kelmarsh Hall next July. The entire team that has organised the Land Rover show at Billing for the last 16 years will be there, as will most of the trade stands and clubs. We hope to see you there.</p>

	<p>For all the crazy rides on display at the SEMA show in Las Vegas, it seems every year a pair of rims manages to attract the most attention. A few years ago it was the arrival of 30-inch rims. Last year it was the $1,000,000 rims from Asanti. This year all we've heard about are these clear wheels that we just have to go check out, so check them out we did before the show closed last night. The D'Vinci Forgiato Radurra wheels are made from polycarbonate and are totally transparent where one would expect to see spokes. The wheel on display featured 1.5-inch think polycarbonate, while the set installed on the Mercedes-Benz CLS had 2-inch thick polycarobonate. Each wheel costs $2,000, which is a bargain compared to the $250k you need to cough up roll on just one Asanti rim. You'll need the extra dough, though, to keep these clear wheels clean of brake dust.</p><p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/img_7084a.jpg" width="449" height="300" alt="Clear Wheels" /></p>

<p>Forester Sports 2.5 XT Adds VDC Stability Control<br />
Unique, Sporty Styling and Exclusive Interior Features<br />
Enhanced Audio with Available Satellite Radio</p>

<p>LAS VEGAS, Oct. 31, 2006 &#8211; Subaru of America, Inc. is showcasing two new versions of its All-Wheel Drive 2007 Forester compact SUV at the annual Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Show. The 2007 Forester Sports models combine new, more powerful styling with exclusive interior features and enhanced standard equipment. The Forester Sports 2.5 XT adds to that the 224-horsepower intercooled turbocharged Boxer engine from the 2.5 XT Limited model.</p>

<p>With more aggressive styling, the new Forester Sports models are distinguished from their siblings by a new front bumper and unique black mesh grille. For a sleeker profile, the standard roof rail crossbars have been deleted on the Forester Sports models, but remain available as an accessory. The Forester Sports 2.5 XT in addition features standard 17-inch alloy wheels.</p>

<p>Inside, the Forester Sports models feature exclusive anthracite black fabric upholstery. An automatic climate control system replaces the manual climate control system that is standard on the regular Forester 2.5 X model. The Sports models' 120-watt AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in-dash CD changer will play MP3/WMA CDs. Also an upgrade over the regular 2.5 X model, this audio system also features SIRIUS&#174; Satellite Radio Capability and a new auxiliary audio jack to connect iPods and similar music players.</p>

<p>All Subaru models come standard with Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, a significant all-road, all-weather traction advantage over competitors that offer front-wheel drive as standard and make All-Wheel Drive an extra-cost option. Four-wheel independent suspension and variable-ratio, variable-power assisted rack-and-pinion steering help make Forester models equally adept at managing twisty back roads and absorbing off-pavement ruts and bumps.</p>

<p>All Forester models feature as standard equipment front seat head/chest side-impact airbags, four-wheel ABS with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), cabin air filtration system, power windows, mirrors and door locks, and a remote keyless entry system. Versatility is ensured by 30.7 cubic feet of carrying space behind the rear seat, which expands to 68.6 cu. ft. when both rear seatbacks are folded.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/forrester-1280--3.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="Subaru Forester Sports XT" /><br />
Legendary Subaru Performance<br />
The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder Subaru Boxer engine that powers the Forester Sports 2.5 X is among the most powerful in its displacement category, with 173 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 166 lb.-ft. of peak torque at 4,400 rpm. The i-Active Valve Lift system helps to ensure responsive performance at all engine speeds.</p>

<p>The turbocharged/intercooled 2.5-liter engine in the Forester Sports 2.5 XT produces 224 horsepower at 5,600 rpm and 226 lb.-ft. of peak torque at just 3,600 rpm. The functional hood scoop, a telltale sign of every turbo Subaru model, provides a stream of fresh air to the engine-mounted intercooler. The Active Valve Control System variable valve timing technology optimizes the engine's volumetric efficiency and performance at all engine speeds. When equipped with the standard 5-speed manual transmission, the Forester Sports 2.5 XT can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in under six seconds. The turbo engine meets the strict Tier 2 Bin 5 Low Emissions Vehicle II (LEV II) certification for 2007.</p>

<p>Three Different Types of Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive<br />
In all Forester models equipped with the 5-speed manual transmission, a viscous coupling locking center differential built into the transmission case divides engine power 50:50. Wheel slippage at one set of wheels causes more power to shift to the opposite set, ensuring that the wheels with the best traction receive more power.</p>

<p>In the Forester Sports 2.5 X equipped with the 4-speed electronic direct control automatic transmission, an electronically managed continuously variable transfer clutch actively manages power distribution based on acceleration, deceleration and available traction.</p>

<p>The Forester Sports 2.5 XT with the optional 4-speed direct control automatic transmission is the first Forester model to use the advanced Variable Torque Distribution (VTD) version of Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive. The VTD system is also used in the Impreza&#174; WRX&#174; Limited model equipped with the optional automatic transmission. The VTD system uses a planetary gear-type center differential that splits the power 45:55, with the rear-wheel bias enhancing handling agility and the performance-driving feel. An electronically controlled continuously variable hydraulic transfer clutch controls power distribution between the front and rear wheels in response to driver input and driving conditions.</p>

<p>The Forester Sports 2.5 XT with automatic transmission is also the first Forester model equipped with Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC), an advanced stability system that controls VTD All-Wheel Drive operation and integrates an electronic 4-wheel traction control system (TCS). A viscous limited-slip rear differential directs power to the rear wheel with the best traction.</p>

	<p>Yes, even more stuff comes down the pike from the guys and gals of DaimlerChrysler. This time, it's in the form of the Jeep Patriot, as envisioned by the good folks at the Chrysler Design Center. <br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/sema_ppp_450.jpg" width="450" height="283" alt="Jeep Patriot" align ="left" /><br />
In the meantime, we'll call it the Partly Pragmatic Patriot and give you the quick and dirty on what's been done. The modifications made were centered on making this mild-mannered people mover into a true off-roader. The majority of the focus came by way of jacking up the suspension two-and-a-half inches and throwing on 16" wheels with BFG Mud Terrain tires. That combination of tire and custom-suspension gives the PPP over 11-inches of ground clearance, which will make it easier to avoid smashing that new, metal front-bumper into large, immovable objects.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the team threw on a new roof rack and lighting system, and did their best to make the PPP as purposeful as it looks.</p>

The Wrangler Rubicon King gets a healthy splattering of pupil skrinking orange and then is hoisted into the air with a four-inch lift, provided by Superlift Suspension. The standard rolling stock is ditched in favor of Mopar/Hutchinson beadlock wheels, wrapped in TA Krawler rubber.</p>

<p>Some of the more trick features include a 9.0 RC winch, fender flares, military-grade tow shackles and a re-trimmed grill. A radio delete gets rid of the tunes, but since the rear seats have been dispatched to make room for the spare, complaining from passengers will be kept at a minimum.</p>

		Antonov presents world&#8217;s first high performance car and SUV with 2-speed supercharger technology at SEMA show in Las Vegas		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	

<p>Antonov, a European automotive technology company, is presenting its innovative 2-speed supercharger drive system at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show running Tuesday 31 October to Friday 3 November 2006 at the Las Vegas Convention Centre. </p>

<p>A Hummer H3 incorporating the patented technology will be presented at the show on stand 11976 by Antonov&#8217;s US distributor Wheel to Wheel Powertrain and the system&#8217;s performance enhancing characteristics will be demonstrated at the show proving grounds in a Ford Mustang GT.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have yet to put the Hummer on our chassis dynamometer, but given our experience with the Mustang, we anticipate the 2-speed supercharger drive system will similarly give a massive boost to power and torque up to the mid range engine speed,&#8221; says Brad Shantry, Wheel to Wheel performance product development manager. </p>

<p>&#8220;The enhanced engine performance and increased power and torque will be particularly useful on a medium size 4-wheel drive sport utility vehicle.  I think the system would also benefit other SUVs, because of their often less than favourable power to weight ratios.  Also the ability of the Antonov shift mechanism to operate as a self-contained passive device, without the need for additional external controls, offers the benefit of high mechanical efficiency.&#8221;</p>

<p>The performance enhancing characteristics of Antonov&#8217;s 2-speed drive system will be dramatically verified at the show&#8217;s proving grounds through its AR500 Ford Mustang GT demonstrator on the afternoon of Thursday 2 November.  Road test editors and automotive journalists are being invited to take a ride with SCCA national road racing licence holder Gautam Pathak, who will put the high performance rear wheel drive car through its paces.  Pathak has extensive driving experience gained at numerous test tracks all over the world and developed his skills as a vehicle dynamics engineer with Ford and Visteon.  He is currently director of product development with the exhaust specialist company Corsa, whose equipment is also featured on the car,</p>

<p>&#8220;The Antonov Mustang is a must see for power enthusiasts because it is the first example of this interesting new performance technology,&#8221; said Pathak.  &#8220;It reduces the elapsed time and the extra acceleration increases the standing quarter mile terminal speed from 101mph to 112mph.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Mustang, Wheel to Wheel Powertrain has neatly installed the 2-speed drive and the Rotrex supercharger beneath the intake manifold, so that the system nestles neatly into the valley of the V8 engine.  Wheel to Wheel also custom fabricated the cold air induction system, which features an aluminium intake manifold with five internally mounted liquid-to-air intercoolers.  In the Hummer, the 2-speed supercharger drive system has been installed to share the power steering bracket of the I5 engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Mustang, Antonov&#8217;s planetary gearset automatically engages a 1.36-to-1 step-up ratio in the first half of the engine rev band during hard acceleration,&#8221; said Shantry.  &#8220;The higher speed of the supercharger impellor increases power and torque to the rear wheels by an impressive 58 per cent at engine speeds up to 4,200rpm.  We have the same step-up ratio in the Hummer and anticipate a similar percentage increase in performance.&#8221; </p>

<p>Antonov chief executive John Moore, who will fly out to the show from the company&#8217;s new UK headquarters at Thetford in Norfolk, commented:  &#8220;The performance boost in the Mustang at low engine revs is significant and the way it&#8217;s been calibrated for this high performance application is appropriate and easily felt by the driver.  The Antonov drive system literally does feel like another gearbox.  It just happens to be located where you least expect it; as part of the front end engine breathing system.  We are confident of a similar performance boost for the Hummer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The series production of a 2-speed Antonov drive aimed at the US tuner market is already proving the capability of the system as a compact and effective solution for a number of powertrain applications.</p>

<p>&#8220;The experience we&#8217;re gaining from these high performance installations is proving invaluable,&#8221; said Moore.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a tough market and our drive system needs to be pretty robust to survive.  For the US tuner market the 2-speed supercharger drive simply does a phenomenal job of boosting vehicle performance &#8230; but there are additional mainstream powertrain applications we&#8217;re actively pursuing, where the primary aim is to calibrate the system to enhance efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.&#8221; </p>

<p>Antonov is already investigating the potential for its compact 2-speed supercharger drive system to replace a much larger positive displacement compressor in a high volume production engine, where very tight packaging and close matching of the supercharger to the engine is the primary motive.   Further applications to improve powertrain efficiency are also being investigated through research into front end accessory drives.  This enables the vehicle alternator and air conditioning to be run more efficiently, whilst providing the output needed by modern cars when the engine is idling. </p>

<p>The mainstream automotive trend towards fuel cell and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as smaller displacement internal combustion engines, similarly implies a need for more forced induction systems and hence centrifugal superchargers &#8230; again another opportunity to better match the characteristics of the blower to the engine with 2-speed drive systems.   There is also growing interest in the use of 2-speed drives in conjunction with alternating current electric motors as a lower cost alternative to permanent magnet motors in electric vehicles.</p>

<p>The Antonov Mechanical Module (AMM) is patented technology and provides a small stand-alone, self-controlling multi-speed drive system which can be designed and manufactured for 2, 3 or even 4-speed applications.  The mechanism is entirely self-changing with no electronic, hydraulic or pneumatic control systems and during the design stage the shift points can be set to any desired engine speed.  The benefits of a fully automatic mechanical system applied to a supercharger include high transmission efficiency, compact size and moderate cost.  The Antonov drive can be fully integrated with the latest Rotrex C30 and C38 superchargers with no power consumption other than minimal gear losses.</p>

<p>&#8220;These US applications are strategically important for the company as they address one of the world&#8217;s largest markets for tuner products,&#8221; said Moore.  &#8220;It enables Antonov&#8217;s drive system to be released into the marketplace as a proven technology and underpins our discussions with carmakers interested in high volume global applications for addressing more fundamental carbon emission issues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in the UK, Antonov has upgraded its Chevrolet Lacetti demonstrator with a fully-integrated series production unit produced by its manufacturing partner Neue ZWL Zahnradwerk Leipzig GmbH.  The UK demonstrator will shortly be made available for European motoring journalists to evaluate alongside a Mercedes demonstrator also under preparation</p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Chrysler Group will unveil the all-new Jeep&#174; Wrangler at the Paris Motor Show this week, and reveal a concept car that hints at a brand new Dodge saloon car that will be on sale in the UK by the middle of next year.</p>

<p>The production version of the two-door Jeep Wrangler and four-door Jeep Wrangler Unlimited are being shown in Europe for the first time, and will be in dealers in the UK by April next year.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51281-a-chr+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Jeep Wrangler" align="right" /><br />
Peter Lambert, Managing Director of Chrysler Group UK, said: &#8220;This new Wrangler offers drivers the &#8216;rugged&#8217; Jeep look and feel without letting its extreme off-road ability compromise on-road dynamics. The new model is a significant step forward from the old vehicle, as it offers a diesel engine for the first time, a choice of short and long-wheelbase, much better road manners, reduced noise levels, a host of safety features, a convertible hard top and an all-new interior with space for five adults and their luggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We expect the new Jeep Wrangler to attract attention from families that currently buy the Land Rover Defender. We will offer impressive value for money and fuel economy plus a diesel auto option and convertible hard roof not available on the competition.&#8221;<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51281-b-chr+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Jeep Wrangler Unlimited" align="left" /><br />
While 99 per cent of Wrangler and Wrangler Unlimited sold in the UK in 2007 will be powered by a new 2.8-litre diesel engine, a handful of Jeep &#8216;Wrangler Rubicon&#8217; models will be sold with a new<br />
3.8-litre petrol engine and a host of additional off-road features that will make this the best off-road Wrangler ever.</p>

<p>Dodge is also looking to break new ground with the all-new Dodge Avenger concept &#8211; a bold styling statement that does away with the idea that a functional family car is automatically boring.</p>

<p>The Avenger concept will appeal to car buyers around the world who need the practicality, functionality and fuel efficiency of a mid-size saloon, but want more, including a vehicle that stands out and makes a statement. Avenger&#8217;s bold muscle car styling, innovative features and solid performance will allow them to do just that.</p>

<p>Peter Lambert added: &#8220;While the Avenger concept only hints at the latest vehicle from Dodge, it will do what Caliber has done for the family hatchback and what Nitro promises to do in the 4x4 segment &#8211; it offers a unique alternative to the competition. The Dodge Caliber has been a big success with the car-buying public so we are expecting great things from our two new Dodge vehicles next year.&#8221;<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51281chr+.jpg" width="350" height="240" alt="Dodge Avenger" align="right" /><br />
From the front, large quad headlamps surrounded by black housings create the distinctive glare that forms Avenger&#8217;s face and surround the signature Dodge crosshair grille. Avenger&#8217;s side profile is distinguished by a long bonnet, short deck lid proportions with muscular rear shoulders and sleek rear spoiler. This concept&#8217;s long glasshouse is created by the use of a high-gloss black B-pillar and aerodynamic inspired rear door appliqu&#233;s, which make this mid-size saloon look like it&#8217;s pouncing forward, even when it&#8217;s at a standstill.</p>

<p>Deep side sills, nineteen-inch five-spoke painted satin silver wheels and deep red brake callipers add to the Avenger concept&#8217;s sporty look. Chrome-tipped dual exhaust outlets communicate the performance capability of the Avenger concept&#8217;s 2.0-litre turbo diesel engine.</p>

	<p>Volkswagen has revealed the first photographs of its new Touareg luxury 4x4, ahead of its world public debut at the Paris Motor Show next week.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/210906vw+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="VW Touareg" align="left" /><br />
Sporting a new &#8216;face&#8217;, revised rear styling, updated interior and seats as well as the Dynaudio sound system as an option, the new Touareg will go on sale in the UK at the end of January 2007.</p>

<p>At the front, the new Touareg features a new grille, bonnet, front wings and bumper, plus new headlights and mirrors.  The rear lights, spoiler, bumper and exhaust pipes have also been modified to freshen the 4x4&#8217;s appearance.</p>

<p>The new Touareg will feature new and revised technology, including ABSPlus and additional ESP (Electronic Stabilisation Programme) features.  ABSPlus has been developed and patented by Volkswagen and is a world first.  The system shortens the braking distance by up to 20% on loose driving surfaces.  New features have been added to the ESP, these include Active Rollover Protection (ARP), rain brake support, fading brake support and understeer control logic, which improves the turning behaviour in the event of understeer.</p>

<p>The UK line-up will remain as before with three trim levels &#8211; Touareg, SE and Altitude &#8211; all of which boast high levels of standard specification and trim.</p>

<p>Four engines will be available: one petrol and three diesel.  These are a 3.6-litre V6 280 PS petrol; 2.5-litre TDI 174 PS with DPF (diesel particulate filter); 3.0-litre V6 TDI 225 PS with or without DPF; and the range-topping 5.0-litre V10 TDI with 313 PS and DPF.  The 2.5-litre TDI will be available as standard with a six-speed manual gearbox and optional Tiptronic automatic transmission.  All other engines will be mated to the six speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The current Touareg model went on sale in the UK in May 2003.  The car is designed to deliver class-leading performance both on and off the road.  Features such as permanent four-wheel drive, low and high gear ratios, electronic traction control linked to an auto-locking centre differential, hill start and descent assist and short front and rear overhangs all contribute to class-leading capability when venturing off the beaten track.  Extremely steep slope angles are within the Touareg&#8217;s capability, and versions with air suspension can ford depths of up to 580 mm.</p>

<p>Since launch, over 10,500 Touaregs have been sold in the UK.</p>

		UNIQUE ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE SYSTEM FOR NEW FORD TRANSIT REVEALED AT HANOVER SHOW		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	
<p>A new all-wheel-drive (AWD) Ford Transit has been revealed this week at the Hanover Commercial Vehicle Show in Germany. The AWD system automatically provides stepless torque flow to the front wheels when required on slippery surfaces.</p>

<p>This new derivative is specifically targeted at customers who frequently face low friction surfaces, adding more flexibility and reliability to their transportation needs. The Transit's AWD system is available with the 2.4-litre 140 PS Duratorq TDCi diesel engine equipped with a six-speed manual transmission.</p>

<p>Steve Kimber, commercial vehicles director, Ford of Britain, said: "The new Transit range showcases what versatility for commercial vehicles is all about with a range of clean and efficient engines, front or rear wheel drive, dozens of body configurations, heavy duty front axle option, and passenger car comfort. The addition of the AWD system extends the choice again adding extra confidence when driving over slippery road surfaces. The system's design helps to reduce friction and mechanical losses often associated with AWD technology."</p>

<p>The AWD system is purely mechanical and operates automatically so that the driver is not distracted by having to engage the system. In slippery conditions the system simply increases drive to the front wheels, enhancing the vehicle's overall road performance.</p>

<p>Drive is taken off the transmission main shaft via a helical gear set towards the front differential. A system of mechanical multiplate clutches combined with an hydraulic freewheel mechanism feeds power forward when required.</p>

<p>The smooth and intelligently controlled torque flow to the front wheels via the freewheeling hydraulic unit ensures that the Transit's well proven driving dynamics are maintained even under slippery conditions. Standard ground clearance is also retained as a bulky differential housing is not needed with this compact and lightweight AWD system.</p>

<p>Compared with the standard rear wheel drive Transit, the additional front axle weight is just 50 kg &#8211; the rear axle weight does not change.</p>

<p>The Ford Transit AWD will be offered with rear wheel drive, single rear wheel vehicles across a broad range of cab-styles including single and double chassis cab and minibuses, plus the Transit panel van range. Low, medium or high roof derivatives will be available and short, medium or long wheelbase.</p>

<p>Key customers for the new model are those frequently encountering low friction surfaces and bad weather conditions. Transit AWD has improved off road capability but does not include raised ground clearance, therefore retaining standard load heights.</p>

<p>The new Transit AWD is perfectly suited for authorities like police, forest wardens, rescue services and fire brigades, providing the reassurance and confidence to handle situations which are beyond the capabilities of a standard vehicle. Transit ambulances fitted with the AWD system, for example, will be more able to ensure ongoing mobility in adverse conditions and deliver patients safely where previously they may have been delayed.</p>

<p>Utility companies will also benefit from the capabilities of the Transit AWD, as they will be surefooted performers for field and track work (for example crossing a muddy field track to fix a pylon). Ultimately this saves time and means that utility resources can be more effectively deployed.</p>

<p>"The all-wheel-drive system is completely transparent to customers, requiring no driver intervention, and it doesn't sacrifice any of the vehicle's core commercial qualities. It greatly expands Transit's capability as it adds more safety and flexibility to any kind of delivery or transport usage," added Steve Kimber. </p>

<p>&#183;         First public showing of QASHQAI compact crossover</p>


<p>&#183;         Upgraded 2007 Pathfinder</p>

<p>Following its recent world premiere in Paris, Nissan will be showing the QASHQAI, its new compact crossover, in public for the first time at this year&#8217;s Paris Motor Show.</p>

<p>Inspired by the concept car of the same name that was presented at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show, the QASHQAI is a new vehicle for Nissan in Europe, with sales starting in February 2007.</p>

<p>It will cater for those car-buyers who want a more dynamic design than that offered by a traditional C-segment car, but who are not attracted to the large, aggressive nature of a compact SUV. Full details of QASHQAI can be found at <a href="http://www.nissanpress.co.uk">www.nissanpress.co.uk</a></p>

<p>2007 Pathfinder<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51244nis+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="Nissan Pathfinder" align="left" /><br />
The Pathfinder will be upgraded for 2007 with the fitment of Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist to automatic versions of the SUV.</p>

<p>Hill Descent Control is a system to facilitate a well controlled descent of steep inclines without driver intervention, while Hill Start Assist allows easy starting on steep ascents. The descent system uses engine software to regulate the speed of the vehicle during steep descents, allowing drivers to concentrate on steering without applying the brakes.</p>

<p>Similarly, to facilitate easy departure on a steep ascent, the Pathfinder&#8217;s brakes will hold the vehicle for up to three seconds after the brake pedal has been released, allowing the driver to apply the power smoothly to prevent roll-back.</p>

<p>As well as the addition of these two systems, 2007 model year Pathfinder will be Euro 4 compliant, with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) being fitted as standard on automatic versions. The same engine changes also apply to the Navara pick-up.</p>

<p>Prices for the 2007 Pathfinder remain unchanged with the range starting from &#163;22,995.</p>

<p>Hyundai has released the first pictures of its stunning Arnejs concept; the best clue yet as to what the company&#8217;s all new C-segment car will look like when it arrives in the UK next summer.  The Arnejs concept car will be on display at the Paris Motor Show later this month.</p>

<p>Designed at Hyundai&#8217;s European Research and Design centre in R&#252;sselsheim, Germany, the Arnejs builds on design elements first seen in the Genus concept at Geneva Motor Show earlier this year.  And it marks a further significant milestone in Hyundai&#8217;s development of a stronger brand identity. </p>

<p>The Arnejs, pronounced Ar-nez, will be formally unveiled at 17.30 on Hyundai&#8217;s stand, number 511 in Hall Three of the Paris Motor Show, on 28 September 2006. </p>

		FIRST PICTURES OF NEW TOURAN REVEALED BEFORE PARIS SHOW		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/120906vw+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="VW Touran" align="left" /></p>

<p>Volkswagen has revealed the first images of its new Touran compact MPV, ahead of its world public debut at the Paris Motor Show later this month.</p>

<p>With a fresh new appearance and innovative technologies, yet still boasting all the practical features for which the Touran has become renowned, the revised seven-seater people carrier looks set to continue the model&#8217;s success.</p>

<p>The new Touran will be the first Volkswagen available with ParkAssist, an optional parking guidance system developed by Volkswagen engineers.  ParkAssist enables automatic parking, using front and rear ultrasonic sensors to detect available parking space and a control unit to calculate the ideal manoeuvring path.  Acoustic and visual displays guide the driver to the correct parking start position, then once reverse gear is selected the car parks itself in under 15 seconds.  All the driver has to do in this time is accelerate and brake &#8211; the Touran does all the steering.  The system is likely to be available in the UK from June 2007.</p>

<p>In appearance, the revised Touran has a new radiator grille and headlights which are similar to those of the recently launched Eos coup&#233; cabriolet.  At the back, new rear lights and a modified bumper distinguish the new generation Touran.  Inside, new fabrics and stainless steel trim, plus an MP3-compatible radio/CD player among other items give an upmarket feel and make the cabin a nicer place to be.</p>

<p>In the UK, the Touran line-up of S, SE and Sport remains, while engines will be rationalised to include two petrol and four diesel units.  These will be a 1.6-litre 102 PS and 1.4-litre 140 PS TSI; and 1.9-litre 90 and 105 PS TDI plus 2.0-litre 140 and 170 PS, the latter with DPF (diesel particulate filter).</p>

<p>The new Touran will go on sale in the UK early next year; prices will be confirmed closer to launch.  The current Touran went on sale in the UK in summer 2003 and has proved very successful with sales of over 32,700 units since launch. </p>

Hiroshima, Japan, 7 September 2006. Mazda Motor Corporation will showcase the European version of the Mazda CX-7, its highly-anticipated crossover sport-utility vehicle (SUV), at the Paris International Motor Show to be held from Thursday, 28 September through Sunday, 15 October 2006.</p>

<p>A unique combination of sports-car driving fun, bold designing and SUV practicality and comfort, the Mazda CX-7 features a 6-speed manual transmission, new power output and many design elements that are specific to the European model.</p>

<p>Joining the Mazda CX-7 will be the all-new Mazda MX-5 Roadster Coupe with power retractable hard top and the all-new Mazda BT-50 pickup, which is even more stylish, practical and rugged than its successful B-Series predecessor. Also on hand will be the winner of the Grand Prix Du Plus Beau Concept Car at the XXIth Festival Automobile International in Paris in January this year, the Mazda Senku, making its first appearance at a European Motor Show.  </p>

<p>Mazda will hold its press conference at the Mazda stand from 10:00 to 10:15 on Thursday, 28 September 2006. Detailed information and photos will be made available at that time. </p>

<p>Posted Sep 7th 2006 12:56PM by John Neff<br />
Filed under: Concept Cars, Paris Motor Show, Hatchbacks</p>


<p>Daihatsu will be displaying this D-Compact X-Crossover concept at the Paris Motor Show later this month along with the very xB-like Materia multi-purpose vehicle. The D-Compact X-Over is supposed to reflect the idea of "harmony with nature" and keeps the greenery outside in clear view at all times by using a glass roof that extends from the windshield all the way back over the rear seats. The design was penned by Italdesign and, while pleasant enough, seems like it would get lost easily in a parking lot full of concept vehicles (i.e. it's just not very distinctive).</p>

		HONDA ANNOUNCES ALL-NEW CR-V		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51044hon+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Honda SR-V" align="left" /></p>

<p>An entirely-new CR-V goes on sale in the UK from January 2007. It promises a driving experience as good as a D-sector saloon car, improved equipment levels and Honda&#8217;s latest advanced safety technology. All this, and the CR-V remains as practical as ever.</p>

<p>The outgoing model dominated retail sales charts since launch, set new standards in the SUV sector and remains the benchmark vehicle for its impressive road manners and versatility. With the market becoming increasingly crowded, Honda has raised the bar further &#8211; the latest CR-V is even better on the road, has a more sophisticated interior and it&#8217;s even more practical.</p>

<p>A lower centre of gravity (reduced by 35mm), wider stance (increased by 30mm) and a number of changes to steering and suspension geometry have all helped to enhance the CR-V&#8217;s handling characteristics. Steering response is faster and feels more direct, while directional stability and all-round agility also benefit from further development to the car&#8217;s chassis.</p>

<p>While the on-road capabilities of the CR-V are much-improved, its off-road skills have been tweaked as well, with a revised Real Time 4WD system that detects front wheel slip and promptly sends torque rearwards. The new system &#8211; which, like the outgoing model, features a quiet, dual-pump system with a one-way cam unit &#8211; can transfer 20 per cent more torque compared to the existing unit. This 4WD set-up not only allows light off-road driving, but also helps maintain stability on the road &#8211; in snow or other slippery conditions, for example.</p>

<p>Improvements made to the driving dynamics are reflected in the styling of the vehicle &#8211; a coupe-like tapering side window profile gives the CR-V a similar shape to a car. The front has been given a bold presence, with a distinctive double grille as the focal point, flanked by projector-style headlights and a large bumper. It all makes for a muscular front end, emphasised by the car&#8217;s wide track and 17- or 18-inch wheels. At the rear, a vertically-opening tailgate is the main design feature, sandwiched between roof-high strips of lights, and notably, the spare wheel has gone &#8211; it&#8217;s now hidden under the load compartment floor.</p>

<p>Two active safety systems are available on the new CR-V, and they&#8217;re unique to the SUV segment. The first, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a radar-controlled cruise control function which maintains a set distance to the vehicle in front, while Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) predicts collisions and warns the driver, before applying strong braking and retracting the front seatbelts if the situation becomes critical. Both these systems are optional depending on grade.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a full complement of passive safety measures includes dual stage SRS front airbags, side airbags for front seat passengers, full length curtain airbags, front and rear seatbelt reminders and active front headrests&#173; &#8211; all fitted as standard.</p>

<p>The new CR-V also incorporates Trailer Stability Assist (TSA) as standard which together with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) ensures that towing safety is continuously monitored and corrected. Importantly, towing capacity on the diesel-engined CR-V is increased from 1500kg to a very competitive 2000kg.</p>

<p>Honda anticipates a class-leading Euro NCAP 5-star rating for occupant protection, 4-stars for child protection and a 3-star pedestrian rating. It achieves excellent levels of safety through a strong body structure design, made from 58 per cent high tensile steel.  </p>

<p>Active Front Lighting (AFS) &#8211; headlights that turn to illuminate the road in the direction the vehicle is heading &#8211; also make their way onto the CR-V for the first time. This system uses High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin, accommodation remains generous and the dimensions are similar to the previous CR-V. Load space, however, is extended backwards to take up the space left by the former tailgate-mounted spare wheel.  Access has been improved by larger doors that open wider, and lower sills.</p>

<p>The interior is high quality, featuring metallic elements on the dash and doors that contrast with soft textured black trim. Front seats are larger and more comfortable and the steering column is adjustable for reach as well as rake. Relocation of the gear lever to the base of the centre stack brings it closer to the steering wheel and creates more floor space.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/51044-b-hon+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Honda SR-V" align="right" /><br />
Depending on grade, more premium equipment is available, including a driver&#8217;s 8-way adjustable power seat, leather upholstery, 19-inch alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors and a rear view camera.</p>

<p>Top spec CR-Vs are equipped with a panoramic glass roof &#8211; similar to that found on the Civic &#8211; which provides an even lighter cabin. This can be closed off by two electric blinds which are covered in the same material as the roof lining.</p>

<p>The rear seat (split 60:40 at base, 40:20:40 seat back) is able to slide forward to maximise leg room or luggage space and can also recline for added comfort. The centre section folds flat to enable longer items to be carried while still accommodating two rear seat passengers. A huge load area is created by tumbling forward the seats, storing them upright. This is big enough for two mountain bikes with their front wheels still in place.</p>

<p>Added flexibility is provided by a novel &#8216;Double Deck&#8217; luggage area, created by a shelf that sits at a height of 330mm above the load floor. It means luggage can be subdivided, with that on the lower level more easily accessible. The shelf is also hinged across its width for added convenience. When not in use, the shelf can either be removed or stored snugly in a recess in the floor.</p>

<p>Power comes from a new 2.0-litre petrol or a 2.2 diesel engine. Honda&#8217;s celebrated 140PS 2.2-litre i-CTDi diesel continues; but as aerodynamic efficiency is improved by 12 per cent, fuel economy proves even better.</p>

<p>The petrol engine is an all-new unit based on the 1.8-litre SOHC i-VTEC from the Civic range. And like that engine the 2.0-litre features latest VTEC and friction reduction technologies, plus the delayed closure of the intake valves combined with a wide open throttle valve during low-load driving conditions. This helps to reduce pumping losses and thus boost fuel economy. Petrol engine models are also equipped with brand new transmissions: all manual gearboxes are 6-speed, while a 5-speed automatic is also available.</p>

<p>Maximum power is 150 PS at 6,200 rpm (lower in the rev range than the current 2.0), while torque is 190Nm (140lb.ft) at 4,200 rpm. The efficiency of the engine, together with improved aerodynamics and new gearboxes, have boosted fuel economy figures. Performance is also enhanced, with the 0 to 62mph time dropping from 10.8 to 10.2 seconds (manual) and from 13.1 to 12.2 seconds (automatic).</p>

<p>The new CR-V will receive its international show debut in Paris on 28 September.</p>

<p>FX and M debuted, Future product range disclosed, New European Infiniti headquarters to be located in Switzerland</p>

<p>Moscow, (30 August , 2006) &#8211; Infiniti, the luxury division of Nissan, celebrated its official launch in Russia today at the Moscow International Motor Show.  The initial line-up of Infiniti vehicles, which go on sale this fall, includes the sporty crossover FX and the M luxury performance sedan, both offered in 3.5l V6 and 4.5l V8 versions and available at dealerships in Moscow and St Petersburg. Infiniti also disclosed its future Russian product line-up including the G35 sport sedan and QX56 full-size SUV and provided a hint at the future with the Infiniti Coupe Concept.  During its press conference, Infiniti also announced its new European headquarters would be established in Switzerland.  </p>

<p>Infiniti&#8217;s entry into the Russian market is part of the global expansion of the brand as part of the company&#8217;s three-year plan called NISSAN Value Up.  Launched in the US and Canada in 1989, Infiniti is currently sold across North America, Taiwan, Korea and the Middle East. Further launches of the Infiniti brand are planned for China and Ukraine in 2007. </p>

<p>&#8220;Today, we celebrate Infiniti&#8217;s expanding presence as a globally recognised luxury brand, a brand that offers a unique combination of serenity, silky design and driving pleasure,&#8221;<br />
said Carlos Tavares, Executive Vice President, Product Planning and Corporate Strategy,</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nissan Motor Co.  &#8220;We believe that in Russia, as in other Infiniti markets, our customers will be those looking for this new, very personal style of luxury and respectful treatment,&#8221; continued Tavares.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Infiniti also disclosed details about the future Infiniti product range in Russia.  &#8220;In the course of 2007, the Infiniti FX crossover and M luxury performance sedan will be joined in dealer showrooms by two additional products: the all-new G35 sport sedan and the QX56 full-size luxury SUV,&#8221; Tavares added.  The range of products on stage at the Moscow International Motor Show was completed by the Infiniti Coupe Concept, &#8220;a hint at the future embracing the continuous advancement of Infiniti design with a unique combination of passion, imagination and creativity,&#8221; said Tavares.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>At launch this autumn, Infiniti will be supported by a dedicated sales and service network consisting of two dealerships in Moscow and one in St Petersburg.  The dealer showrooms will incorporate the new Infiniti Retail Environment Design Initiative (IREDI) design standards, a dynamic global dealership design standard for Infiniti retailers around the world.  The IREDI program is one of the key pillars of the Total Ownership Experience (TOE), a customer-centric philosophy dedicated to building lasting relationships that go beyond product and embraces Japanese luxury.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Infiniti also announced the establishment of a regional headquarters for Infiniti Europe operations to be located in Rolle, Vaud canton in Switzerland, &#8220;a natural home of luxury brands in Europe,&#8221; noted Tavares. Infiniti will be distributed in Europe through a dedicated sales and service network that will begin operations during 2008.</p>

<p>Honda will reveal production versions of the new CR-V compact SUV and the high performance Civic Type R, on its biggest ever stand at the Paris Motor Show in September.</p>

<p>The completely new CR-V combines SUV practicality with saloon car-like driving dynamics, sophisticated styling and an upmarket, well-equipped interior that help take the car into the upper tiers of the SUV market. It will also be available with the advanced Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS), two unique and cutting-edge technologies that deliver added driver convenience and enhanced safety.</p>

<p>A new 2.0-litre petrol engine, together with Honda&#8217;s renowned 2.2-litre i-CTDi diesel engine, ensures the CR-V continues to offer class-leading fuel consumption and performance.</p>

<p>The keenly awaited Civic Type R also makes its debut in production-model guise, a car which captures the same degree of exhilarating performance as its predecessor, but in a more refined package for the road.</p>

<p>The &#8216;superhatch&#8217; Type R offers impressive performance levels with aggressive styling and improved handling characteristics to deliver enhanced predictability, responsiveness and an even more rewarding driving experience.</p>

<p>Also being revealed at Paris is the 2007 FR-V, which has a new engine line-up for next year. Honda&#8217;s compact multi-purpose vehicle, featuring six seats arranged in two rows of three, now features the 1.8 litre SOHC i-VTEC engine (first seen in the 5-door Civic) together with a series of detail exterior and interior changes.</p>

<p>Themed zones</p>

<p>The Honda stand at the Paris Show is made up of three zones: Advanced Technology, Sports and Product.</p>

<p>New CR-V and new Civic Type R are the main ingredients of the new Product Zone. They will be joined by the revised FR-V and the recently-launched Civic Type S, as well as the gadget-laden Accord.</p>

<p>In the Sports zone, Honda&#8217;s success at the pinnacle of motorsport &#8211; Formula 1 &#8211; will be represented on the stand by the winning RA106, as raced by Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello this season, together with the Honda RA806E V8 engine which powers this car.</p>

<p>Alongside will be a racing variant of the new Civic Type R. Developed by JAS Motorsport &#8211; the official partner of Honda in customer racing support &#8211; the racing Civic Type R will be fully FIA homologated for 2007 track and rally events.</p>

<p>The Sports zone is rounded off by a special edition of the Honda S2000 roadster in Super Platinum White and with a Passion Red and Black interior.</p>

<p>Honda&#8217;s pre-eminent role in developing fuel efficient and alternatively-fuelled vehicles is showcased within the stand&#8217;s Advanced Technology zone.</p>

<p>Honda will also be showing the very latest fuel cell technology in the form of the FCX Concept car, a sleek, premium four door saloon featuring a unique, low-floor fuel cell platform that allows a spacious cabin previously unimaginable in a fuel cell vehicle.</p>

<p>Displayed alongside, and illustrating how such vehicles might be fuelled, will be Honda&#8217;s Home Energy Station. This can generate hydrogen from a domestic gas supply, as well as generate electricity to power the home using its own fuel cells, and at the same time recover the heat produced to provide a supply of hot water &#8211; represented at the Motor Show by a &#8216;home&#8217; set complete with TV screen and wash basin producing hot water, courtesy of the Home Energy Station.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Civic Hybrid Sports concept proves that super-efficiency can be stylish and visually-arresting. Fitted with deep front and rear spoilers and side skirts, the aggressive-looking body is finished in a special blue paint, and set off by chrome finish seven-spoke alloy wheels and exhaust tailpipes. The equally distinctive interior uses the contrast of black and white as a colour scheme, with bucket seats providing a sporting flourish.</p>

<p>Sharing the same part of the stand, the Civic Hybrid Cut model uses cutaways and transparent body panels to expose key elements of the hybrid technology to provide a better understanding of the technology and the benefits achieved.</p>

<p>Honda press conference: on the Honda Stand in Hall 3, at 13.30 on Press Day, 28 September &#8211; Paris Motor Show.</p>

The visually arresting TechArt Magnum is proof that 4x4s can outgun Supercars in the power stakes.</p>

<p>Based on the already brutal 450bhp Porsche Cayenne Turbo, the Magnum&#8217;s bodywork and engine have been extensively reworked by renowned German Porsche specialist, TechArt, to deliver a whopping 600bhp.</p>

<p>The latest powerhouse from the Teutonic tuning firm will be on display at this year&#8217;s theatrical car-fest, MPH&#8217;06 (Birmingham, NEC 26-29 October and London&#8217;s Earls Court 2-5 November) in the Sony Ericsson Studio.</p>

<p>The new TechArt machine pumps out its Pagani Zonda rivalling power thanks to a heavily modified twin turbo V8 engine. Despite weighing in at over 2300kg, the Magnum is capable of accelerating to 60mph in a Lamborghini Gallardo humbling 4.5 seconds.</p>

<p>Where speed limits allow, TechArt&#8217;s ultimate interpretation of the Cayenne will reach 183 mph; impressive for a supercar, unbelievable for a 4x4.</p>

<p>If you want to see it for yourself head down to MPH&#8217;06 and feast your eyes on the most desirable cars on sale in the world today. Alongside the displays of exotica, MPH&#8217;06 will feature a live motoring theatre hosted by Jeremy Clarkson and friends. Visitors will also be treated to the sights and sounds of a host of dream cars being tested to their limits in a &#163;1 million choreographed stunt show.</p>

<p>Tickets for MPH &#8217;06, powered by Shell Optimax, are on sale now from &#163;22-49 and can be purchased from <a href="http://www.mphshow.co.uk">www.mphshow.co.uk</a></p>

<p>London, 28 July 2006 &#8211; Land Rover's all new Freelander 2 has emerged as one of the stars of the British International Motor Show. Visitors have flocked to the Land Rover stand to get their first views of the exciting new compact 4x4, which made its world debut at the show at London's ExCeL exhibition centre.</p>

<p>The Freelander 2 is new from the ground up, with outstanding on-road performance as well as the class-leading off-road ability expected of a true Land Rover.  A dynamic design, purposeful stance, smart and spacious interior and an abundance of advanced technologies complete the package.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50916lr+.jpg" width="350" height="209" alt="Landrover Freelander 2" align="left" /><br />
Andy Griffiths, Land Rover's UK Marketing Director, said, "We've been delighted with the level of interest shown in the new Freelander 2.  Not only have visitors been making a bee-line to our stand to see the car in the metal for the first time but we've had thousands of people asking for more details about it.  We're confident many of those inquiries will turn into sales. It's been a really successful show for us."</p>

<p>Prices for the Freelander 2 will start at approximately &#163;22,000 and rise to over &#163;30,000.  Land Rover dealers are taking orders for the new vehicles now and more specification information such as available colours and 360 degree design tours are available online at <a href="http://www.landrover.co.uk">www.landrover.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>As well as unveiling the all new Freelander 2 at ExCeL, Land Rover launched its industry leading CO2 Offset Programme to help balance emissions from its manufacturing operations and customer vehicles.  The pilot programme, to be run by Climate Care, will fund schemes for alternative forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, energy efficiency and technology change.  The programme will run from September to the end of 2008, during which time it's estimated two million tonnes of CO2 will be offset.</p>

<p>Visitors to the motor show were able to experience Land Rover's current range of products for themselves by visiting the Land Rover Terrapod off-road course, situated outside the south hall of ExCeL.</p>

<p>    * 12 new cars launched to the world<br />
    * Halls and attractions full of content visitors<br />
    * Exhibitors report strong business leads and quality audience<br />
    * Dock Rock concerts wow crowds in evening sunshine<br />
    * Superb transport links bring people easily to and from London's Docklands<br />
    * Tickets 50 per cent cheaper and parking costs down  41 per cent on 2004<br />
    * World-class Olympic venue hosts premier league auto show</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Commenting on the British International Motor Show, Tim Etchells, director of show organiser imie, said, 'On every measure of success the boxes can be ticked for a successful show. Visitors are delighted, in particular with our dozen world debuts and hugely popular attractions. Exhibitors are queuing up to tell us what good business they are doing and the venue continues to provide a first class service to all visiting London's Docklands. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'At the close of play on Monday 170,500 visitors had come to the motor show at ExCeL; I am confident that we will be able to confirm in excess of 400,000 show-goers when auditing has taken place; on a like for like basis, that means a minimum 17 per cent increase on visitors at the 2004 event. So I look forward to ticking the final box as we wrap up 2006 and prepare plans for another success story in 2008.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The British International Motor Show is organised by imie under a licence with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. imie has adopted rigorous new 2007 ABC guidelines in auditing the 2006 show.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Motor Show exceeds Volvo targets</p>

<p>For Volvo, the British International Motor Show is exceeding all expectations with sales enquiries, test drive requests and off-road passenger rides well ahead of figures achieved at the last show in 2004.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One week in, and Volvo has already achieved its targets for sales enquiries and test drive requests, while the Adventure Land outdoor attraction has proved particularly popular with over 5,200 people going for a ride to experience the 4x4 abilities of the refreshed XC90.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/00006786_p.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="H2 Hummer" /> </p>

<p>'There is a great atmosphere at the show and everyone seems to like its manageable size, convenient relaxation areas, value and the opportunity for outdoor and evening entertainment,' commented Volvo's PR and Events Director, John Lefley. 'With the all-new C70 and S80, plus the cool C30 Design Concept, on our stand, we expected a high level of interest from show visitors but this has exceeded our expectations, given the new time and venue', he continued.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The appearance of the C30 Design Concept on the Volvo stand has also created an opportunity for Volvo to host a meeting at the show with its creative agencies to prepare marketing communication plans for the new Volvo C30 which is due to arrive in showrooms at the turn of the year.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With four more days to go before the show ends, Volvo is expecting the high levels of interest in the show and the latest Volvo range to continue.</p>

<p>Barabus MD learns the skills to bring new sports car to London</p>

<p>Youngsters have been flocking to the Careers Village to find out about a huge range of job opportunities in the motor industry. But, after visiting the village, they should head over to the Barabus stand in the North Hall, to see a real-life example of what can be achieved.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tony Keating is managing director of sports car company Barabus, which is showing its new TKR sports car. Speaking to motor show news he said that the reason why he had built a sports car was simple: he'd taken an automotive engineering course at Bolton University that had inspired him back in the early 1990s. That, and a love affair with cars like the McLaren F1 and the Jaguar XJ220.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'The response in London has been amazing', he said. 'It's a superb venue for a global launch. We've already had confirmed orders and others on the boil. Saudi and Emirate visitors are particularly interested and these will probably be the main markets for the car.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>27 people are employed at the Manchester base where the TKR is assembled.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>New Renault Clio is cut above for safety</p>

<p>A cut-away, full-size Renault Clio is giving visitors a clear picture of the investment the industry is making in new car safety. The EuroNCAP 5-star performer takes pride of place on the Renault stand and features a complete set of fully deployed airbags.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The car which comes with up to eight airbags, includes front to rear side curtains designed to protect passengers in a side impact as well reinforced deformation zones to absorb the energy of an impact.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But new car safety is not just about protecting occupants in a crash. Increasingly, cars like the new Clio are being designed with technologies that prevent an accident happening at all.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Some of these 'active safety systems' are revealed in a display next to the cut-away Clio. They include traction control and ESP, an electronic stability control system designed to enhance stability by braking individual wheels during under- or over-steer. Anti-lock brakes with brake force distribution ensure control and support during emergency braking while double-distance Xenon lights ensure better visibility at night and during adverse weather.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Aussie writer reveals all</p>

<p>There's no doubt about this motor show's international credentials. That's the view of freelance journalist, P H Cheah, who came from Australia to take in the first British International Motor Show in London for 30 years.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The motoring man from Quakers Hill, New South Wales said he was hugely impressed with the event. And he is a man who should know his stuff; he's been covering British shows &#8211; and others throughout the world - since 1975.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'It is one of the most pleasant motor show days I've had,' he said. 'I've come straight from the airport after flying in from Singapore; I took the train and it was easy to get to the venue. I have three or four friends who are also coming, just because the show is in London.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He added, 'It's great to see major launches like the Land Rover Freelander and Jaguar XKR in London. People come to a motor show to see new cars and it's important that British car makers support this fabulous British show.'</p>

	<p>&#8226; Jeep grows lineup to seven vehicles in 2007</p>

<p>&#8226; Jeep Commander the first of the brand family to offer standard three-row seating, accommodating up to seven passengers in style</p>

<p>London &#8211; The Jeep&#174; brand is on a major product offensive, expanding from three models in 2005 to seven in 2007, the most available to retail consumers at one time in the 65-year history of Jeep vehicles. No other automotive manufacturer in the world has the range of sport-utility vehicles that Jeep offers.</p>

<p>By the end of 2007, the Jeep brand lineup will include Jeep Commander, Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler, plus the all-new Compass, Patriot and the four-door Wrangler Unlimited. These vehicles provide the opportunity to grow the Jeep brand by offering a variety of products that will excite current customers and attract new ones.</p>

<p>"The Jeep brand is on a product offensive and will continue to grow with new offerings that leverage Jeep&#8217;s legendary 4x4 leadership," said Thomas Hausch, Executive Director &#8211; International Sales and Marketing, Chrysler Group. "We are solidifying the Jeep brand&#8217;s foundation with the all-new Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, while also stretching the brand to reach new customers in the growing compact SUV segment with Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot."</p>

<p>Jeep Commander</p>

<p>The new Jeep Commander, on sale in the UK from April 2006, is part of the on-going Jeep product offensive in markets outside North America and is featured today at the British International Motor Show in London. The Commander is the first of the Jeep family to offer as standard three-row seating, accommodating up to seven passengers comfortably. This classic, rugged 4x4 offers UK customers a class-leading vehicle with legendary off-road capabilities and on-road refinement.</p>

<p>The Jeep Commander, with its classic, rugged design, features a host of safety systems plus the Quadra-Drive II&#174; four-wheel-drive system. The Commander is available in the UK with the 3.0-litre V-6 CRD diesel engine and 5.7-litre V-8 HEMI&#174; petrol engine. A choice of two trim levels is available on the 3.0-litre V-6 CRD: Predator and Limited. The 5.7-litre V-8 HEMI comes with the Limited trim only.</p>

<p>Jeep Brand</p>

<p>Jeep, which is one of the most recognised brands in the world, is celebrating its 65th anniversary in 2006. In 1941, the Willys-Overland company delivered to the U.S. Army 1,500 light reconnaissance vehicles called the Willys Quad. Improved vehicles were called the MA and MB, but eventually, those vehicles came to be known as the Jeep. More than 368,000 were built for use during World War II.</p>

<p>Over the years, mastery, authenticity, freedom and adventure have become the hallmarks of the Jeep brand and the basis for its SUV leadership worldwide.</p>

<p>Sales of Jeep brand vehicles outside North America rose to 84,019 units in 2005, a 15 percent increase versus 2004. In calendar-year 2005, all three models &#8211; Wrangler, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee &#8211; posted gains over the prior year</p>

		THE 2006 KIA SORENTO &#8211; MAKING THE BEST EVEN BETTER		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	</div>

	<div class="storyContent">
	

<p>The revised version of Kia's multi-award-winning flagship 4x4, the Sorento, today makes its first UK appearance at the British International Motor Show at ExCeL in London.</p>

<p>It stars alongside the all-new Sedona and Carens, the latter also appearing in the UK for the first time, on a stand which showcases Kia's growing expertise with SUVs and MPVs.</p>

<p>The Sorento, which has just clinched a second successive top spot in the 4x4 category of the J.D. Power and Associates Customer Satisfaction survey to add to its Towcar of the Year 2006 award from the Caravan Club, now offers more of everything.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50827-2-kia+.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Kia Sorento" align="right" /><br />
Both the 2.5-litre turbodiesel (VGT) and 3.3-litre petrol engines deliver improved performance; suspension modifications provide a better balance of ride and handling; safety is enhanced with state-of-the-art accident-avoidance features; there is a contemporary new look; more luxury car options become available; and there are smarter trim materials in a higher-quality cabin.</p>

<p>Yet prices will remain competitive and Kia has realigned its existing trim levels XE, XS and top spec XT to offer improved value-for-money.</p>

<p>The Sorento was Kia's first foray into the high-end SUV market. Designed with European input and with European buyers in mind, it has been a huge success. Sales in the UK were up by 10% in 2005 &#8211; more than double the average for the SUV sector.</p>

<p>The revised model uses the same body panels as the original car, but new front and rear bumpers, grille projection-style headlamps, tail lights and body mouldings give it a more elegant and modern appearance while increasing the overall length by just 20mm.</p>

<p>With diesel models and fleet orders accounting for an ever-increasing percentage of sales, the revisions to Kia's acclaimed 2.5-litre, four-cylinder, 16-valve common-rail engine create scope for improved market penetration. Now fitted with an electrically-actuated variable geometry turbocharger for even more flexible performance, the engine gains 21% more power (now 168bhp) and 25% more torque (392Nm at just 2000rpm).This helps reduce the 0-60mph time by 1.7 seconds while the improvement on power has minimal impact on combined fuel consumption at 35.8mpg. The engine now meets Euro IV emissions standards.</p>

<p>The 3.3-litre V6 petrol engine gains an extra 48bhp plus a modest torque increase, trimming its 0-60mph time to 8.9 seconds while cutting fuel consumption. Figures have still to be ratified.</p>

<p>The diesel is available with five-speed manual or automatic gearboxes, while the V6 is sold as an automatic only. Higher top gear ratios in both gearboxes reduce fuel consumption when cruising at motorway speeds, and the automatic now features Kia's Sports Mode, allowing manual override of gear changes.</p>

<p>The ladder-frame chassis and dual-frame body construction of the original Sorento have earned praise since launch, but for 2006 Kia has retuned the springs and dampers of the fully-independent suspension to give a smoother ride.</p>

<p>The Sorento continues to be available with part-time or full-time four-wheel drive systems.</p>

<p>For increased occupant safety, ESP stability control, active head restraints, front seat-belt pretensioners and a passenger airbag cut-off switch will become available. ESP automatically corrects potential skids by braking one or more wheels and/or reducing engine power, while active head restraints protect against whiplash injury. An audible reversing aid is also now offered to help reduce the risk of parking knocks.</p>

<p>Twin front and full-length curtain airbags are standard.</p>

<p>The quality of the interior has been improved through a new centre stack and floor console, a neater control layout and higher-quality materials. As well as the current grey interior available on XE and XS there will be a new premium black leather and wood effect trim available on the Sorento XT.</p>

<p>The centre stack now houses dual-zone air conditioning, a new double-DIN JVC CD player with MP3 compatibility stereo system and a trip computer.</p>

<p>Reshaped backrests on the front seats and multi-adjustable rear backrests increase legroom and comfort for passengers travelling in the rear.</p>

<p>The 2.5 litre CRDi VGT will be available late summer and the 3.3 litre V6 available at the end of 2006.</p>

		NEW LAND ROVER CO2 OFFSET PROGRAMME		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>ExCeL, London, 18 July 2006 &#8211; Land Rover today announced the next significant step in its ongoing commitment to addressing the challenges of climate change with the introduction of a wide-ranging pilot CO2 offset programme, which will allow both Land Rover and its customers to contribute to a cleaner environment. It is the largest and most comprehensive programme of its kind ever undertaken by an automotive manufacturer in the UK.</p>

<p>The pilot has been established specifically for Land Rover and supports Ford Motor Company's &#163;1 billion investment in the UK announced yesterday. The far-reaching initiative will enable the development of environmental technologies across Ford and its Premier Automotive Group. The 3,000 engineers based at Land Rover's headquarters in Gaydon in Warwickshire will play a key role in developing that technology.</p>

<p>The pilot will run to the end of 2008, and it is estimated that Land Rover's CO2 Offset Programme will offset over two million tonnes of CO2 over the pilot period &#8211; equivalent to the CO2 generated by 125,000 average homes over the same period.</p>

<p>Announced at the British International Motor Show in London, the programme has two key components: offsetting emissions generated by Land Rover vehicle assembly at its two production facilities in Britain; and providing a mechanism for customers to offset emissions from the use of their vehicle. The scheme is to be run independently by Climate Care, a highly respected CO2 offset provider, and will be overseen by a Governance Committee.</p>

<p>"This announcement is part of a multi-stage and ongoing approach by Land Rover to environmental care and sustainability," said Phil Popham, managing director of Land Rover. "Our CO2 offset programme is the second demonstration from Land Rover in five months that it is helping to minimise the impact of its manufacturing processes and vehicles on the environment.</p>

<p>"This industry leading initiative follows hard on the heels of our Land-e technological exhibit which showcases innovative hybrid electric powertrains and biofuel capability &#8211; real world technology which will be seen on Land Rover production vehicles of the future. The announcement made by Ford yesterday will have a considerable impact in enabling us to develop that technology. It also acknowledges the challenges of climate change and recognises our responsibility to take action now."</p>

<p>Mike Mason, director of Climate Care, said: "It will take time to incorporate the new technologies into the full model range so rather than wait, Land Rover have chosen to act immediately and, in addition, introduce a comprehensive CO2 offset programme.  This will start to reduce the climate impact of Land Rovers immediately." </p>

<p>Land Rover's CO2 Offset Programme is part of an integrated approach to reducing CO2 emissions. The ultimate goal is CO2 neutrality and projects will include investment in renewable energy projects such as wind and solar, technology change and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>    * Land Rover will embark on a pilot programme in the UK to offset CO2 emissions from its UK manufacturing operations, ensuring the amount saved balances the original emissions. The facilities are already highly efficient in energy usage and have ongoing efficiency targets. Emissions from Solihull have been cut by 30% since 1997.<br />
    * From 2007 Model Year, customers of all new Land Rover vehicles sold in the UK will pay to offset the CO2 emissions produced by their vehicle, calculated on the certified CO2 emissions level for each Land Rover model and based on 45,000 miles (equivalent 15,000 miles of annual use).<br />
    * For the customer it represents an investment of between &#163;85 and &#163;165 depending on model. Research has shown that Land Rover customers are prepared to play an active role.<br />
    * It is estimated the programme could offset over two million tonnes of CO2 over the pilot period &#8211; equivalent to the output from 125,000 homes over the pilot period. (Source: DEFRA)<br />
    * New Land Rover vehicles all have lower emissions than predecessors in their model range. The all-new Freelander 2, for instance, has 11% less CO2 emissions in petrol form and the diesel version emits 5% less than the outgoing Freelander.<br />
    * The new Range Rover TDV8, launched at the Madrid Motor Show, has performance figures to match the V8 petrol model but has 32% better fuel economy.<br />
    * Land_e, first demonstrated at the Geneva Motor Show in March, includes innovative electric hybrid drive that not only allows for pollution-free electric drive in town, but also boosts off-road performance by using the enormous low-speed torque of the electric engine. It would cut CO2 emissions by 30% and give a 50 mpg fuel economy on a Freelander size vehicle. </p>

<p>"Land Rover customers can be reassured that not only is their latest purchase more efficient and less polluting , but they are also part of a scheme to make immediate and real reductions through CO2 offset projects around the world," said Phil Popham.</p>

<p>    * Climate Care, who will manage the Land Rover scheme, is one of Britain's most respected independent CO2 offset providers.<br />
    * Previous Climate Care initiatives have included wind turbines in India, installing low energy lighting in South Africa and providing renewable energy cooking stoves to schools in India. </p>

<p>Mike Mason added: "Land Rover recognise that climate change is a serious threat to the planet.  In response, Land Rover and their parent, Ford, have committed to an extensive programme of emissions reductions from their vehicles.  However the threat is not only serious but also urgent. Climate Care is pleased that Land Rover has taken this initiative to deal with emissions in the short term whilst stepping up their efforts to tackle the longer term challenges.  We believe this is the first time a programme of such scope and vision has been launched, and we hope it sets a benchmark for others."</p>

<p>A Governance Committee will oversee all aspects of the scheme's administration and implementation.</p>

<p>"It is our prime objective that everyone involved can see exactly how the scheme is being run and what benefits it is producing, both in terms of projects funded and offsetting of CO2," added Phil Popham. </p>

ExCeL, London, 18 July 2006 &#8211; Land Rover's all-new Freelander 2 makes its world debut today at the British International Motor Show at ExCeL in London's Docklands. The vehicle is displayed on the Land Rover show stand alongside an updated, 2007 model year Range Rover TDV8, a Range Rover Sport TDV6 and a Discovery 3 TDV6.</p>

<p>The Freelander 2 is new from the ground up, with outstanding on-road performance as well as the class-leading off-road ability expected of a true Land Rover. A dynamic design, purposeful stance, smart and spacious interior and an abundance of advanced technologies complete the package.</p>

<p>Technical highlights of the Freelander 2 include:</p>

<p>    * Two new engines:<br />
          o 2.2-litre TD4 diesel (160 PS / 118 kW) &#8211; better fuel economy than its predecessor (37.7 mpg : 7.5 l/100 km) and 43 per cent more power<br />
          o 3.2-litre i6 petrol (233 PS / 171 kW) &#8211; 30 per cent more powerful than the outgoing V6 with 10 per cent improvement in fuel economy<br />
    * Full-time intelligent 4x4 that helps optimise traction and fuel economy<br />
    * Land Rover&#8217; s unique Terrain Response&#8482; &#8211; for easier off-road driving &#8211; heads a long list of advanced technologies, many new to the class</p>

<p>For the 2007 model year, the Range Rover gains a powerful, refined, all-new TDV8 diesel engine, which cuts the 0-60 mph sprint (and 0-100 km/h) by over four seconds, but has the same fuel economy as the outgoing diesel (25.1 mpg combined average). Added technologies include Land Rover&#8217;s acclaimed Terrain Response, electronic park brake and electronic rear &#8216;e&#8217; differential. The improved cabin also gains extra stowage, enhanced finishes and more effective air-conditioning &#8211; plus the option of cooled front seats.</p>

<p>Land Rover's managing director, Phil Popham, said: "We are delighted to be supporting the British International Motor Show here in London with two product debuts &#8211; it is our home show and is very important to our business. The first of these products, an updated Range Rover, comes with a new TDV8 engine which has a balance of performance, refinement and economy that is unmatched &#8211; it makes this vehicle even more desirable."</p>

<p>He continued: "The Freelander 2 sets new standards in the sector, combining the advantages of a premium car with the attributes of a robust 4x4. We believe that no other compact 4x4 gets closer to blending these best-of-both-worlds abilities."</p>

<p>The Range Rover for 2007 goes on sale from September this year, with the Freelander 2 following it into Land Rover showrooms from December. Prices for the Freelander 2 will start at approximately &#163;22,000 and rise to over &#163;30,000. Land Rover dealers are taking orders for the new vehicles now and more specification information such as available colours and 360 degree design tours are available online at <a href="http://www.landrover.co.uk">www.landrover.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors to the motor show can experience Land Rover's current range of products for themselves by visiting the Land Rover Terrapod off-road course, situated outside the south hall of the ExCeL exhibition centre. Free-passenger rides are available over the Terrapod's challenging off-road obstacles, designed and engineered by leading outdoor event agency, D3 Ltd, co-organisers of the Land Rover G4 challenge. </p>

	<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50771-e-toyl+.jpg" width="350" height="250" alt="Lexus" align="left" />Toyota and Lexus models will be making a big contribution to a cavalcade through the heart of London this Sunday as a curtain-raiser to the British International Motor Show. The line-up will represent contrasting dimensions of the two brands&#8217; automotive heritage, from the groundbreaking Corona saloon which introduced Toyota to the UK 40 years ago, to the world-leading hybrid power models of today.</p>

<p>Making its way from Hyde Park Corner to Trafalgar Square, the 100 Years of Cars Parade will take place in prime territory for the hybrid power Toyota Prius and Lexus RX 400h and GS 450h models, all of which are exempt from the central London congestion charge. And the slow pace of the event will enable them to run for periods on their electric motors alone, thus producing no harmful exhaust emissions.</p>

<p>Although famous for its advanced environmentally-focused technology, Prius is also a proven performer in international motor sport. Joining the regular road-going version in the parade will be the Rally Prius, which made history as the first hybrid car to complete an internationally-recognised event, the gruelling 5,000-mile Midnight Sun to Red Sea Rally in 2002.</p>

<p>Further Toyota sporting success will be represented by the ultimate Japanese muscle car, the Supra. A double champion in top-line Japanese GT racing, the Supra has achieved further fame with millions of game players as the four-wheeled icon of the original Gran Turismo for Sony&#8217;s PlayStation. Just like its computerised counterpart, the parade car is presented in full Castrol racing livery. It also has lowered suspension, a full sports body kit and an awe-inspiring sound system with a 2,000-watt amplifier.</p>

<p>Completing the line-up will be two of the famous Top Gear footballing Aygo hatchbacks, which will be showing off their skills at playing keepy-uppy with a giant ball along the parade route.</p>

<p>The parade will set off at 2.30pm this Sunday. The British International Motor Show, at ExCeL in London&#8217;s Docklands, will open to the public on 20 July.</p>

	<p>    * First ever Crossover SUV to star at British International Motor Show<br />
    * GM&#8217;s pioneering technology appears alongside its newest incarnation<br />
    * Captiva builds on fine Chevrolet heritage</p>

<p>With all eyes fixed on the new Captiva at the British International Motor Show, the Chevrolet stand will also feature a car that is a piece of GM&#8217;s global heritage, and proof that when it comes to inventing new market segments, the American brand has always been a leader in its field.</p>

<p>The Chevrolet Suburban Carryall can take the credit for being the world&#8217;s first true &#8216;Crossover&#8217; vehicle &#8211; an area of the new car market that today is booming, and one where New Captiva successfully combines the dynamic attributes of a car with the practicality of an MPV and the presence of a 4x4.</p>

<p>When the Suburban Carryall debuted, it brought with it a name that remains in the Chevrolet range even today (In the USA, Suburban was still a top seller in 2005), and it also introduced new ways of thinking to the motoring public.</p>

<p>Previously, a Station Wagon was a car built on a separate car or van chassis, with the rear bodywork usually constructed out of wood &#8211; but the Carryall was different. Capable of carrying eight passengers and their luggage, it featured an integral pressed steel body built on a rugged commercial vehicle chassis, making it ideal for carrying people in warmth and comfort through many different driving conditions.</p>

<p>Power came from a 3.3-litre straight six engine developing 79PS, fed to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission with full syncromesh.</p>

<p>Originally targeted at taxi companies, or as hotel courtesy vehicles, the Suburban soon developed an identity of its own, as the world&#8217;s most versatile family car &#8211; an attribute that makes it, and the crossover sector, so popular today.</p>

<p>At the British International Motor Show, Chevrolet is proud to pull the covers off the first car to bring the Suburban&#8217;s multitude of talents, not to mention its 70-year heritage to Europe &#8211; the New Captiva. Set to arrive in UK dealers in 2007, this latest chapter in Chevrolet&#8217;s European history is the most exciting yet.</p>

Exciting passenger ride experience in Cayenne S for visitors on purpose-built course</p>

<p>Porsche will once again be participating at this summer&#8217;s Goodwood Festival of Speed (July 7 - 9) with a mix of cars from its illustrious past and powerful present. New for the 2006 Festival, visitors will be able to experience the performance and handling of the Porsche Cayenne on a specially designed dynamics course located next to the famous speed hillclimb course.</p>

<p>The driver-oriented chassis of the Porsche Cayenne has been designed to combine sports car handling on the road with the added versatility of extreme agility off-road. The grass-surfaced course around which the V8-engined 340bhp Cayenne S models will power is intended to demonstrate perfectly the outstanding dynamic ability of the four door Porsche.</p>

<p>A donation to the Richard Burns Foundation, established in memory of the British 2001 World Rally Champion who died last year, will secure an exciting ride in the Porsche Cayenne S. Members of the public will be able to jump into the passenger seats with a Driving Consultant from the Porsche Driving Experience behind the wheel, and enjoy an exciting run in the all-wheel drive Cayenne S.</p>

<p>Complementing the Cayenne dynamics demonstration will be the V8 twin-turbocharged 521bhp Turbo S that will be participating in The Sunday Times Supercar Run up the hillclimb course, a high-octane display of horsepower that celebrates the ultimate in performance road car engineering. Joining the Cayenne Turbo S on the hill and making its public debut will be the exciting 415bhp Porsche 911 GT3, and the new 480bhp Porsche 911 Turbo.</p>

<p>The Goodwood Festival of Speed each year celebrates a motor sporting anniversary, and invites manufacturers and private owners to demonstrate cars of historical significance relating to the events being commemorated. In 2006, the centenary of the Targa Florio race in Sicily is celebrated and Porsche is bringing two cars that raced in the classic event &#8211; the 1962 Type 718/8 RS Spyder and 1970 908/03 Spyder - from its Stuttgart Museum.</p>

<p>Also visiting from the Porsche Museum will be the 1960 Type 718 Formula II single seater race car, and the 1962 Type 804 Formula I race car, winner of the 1962 French and German Grands Prix.</p>

<p>A further unique feature of Goodwood is that the event seeks to reunite famous cars with drivers from the original factory teams. This year, Vic Elford, 1968 winner of the Targa Florio for Porsche, will be taking the wheel of the 1970 Porsche 908/03.</p>

<p>Porsche enthusiasts visiting Goodwood will be pleased to learn that there are many more examples of the marque, and former factory race drivers, participating in the Festival of Speed. The winner of the 1973 Targa Florio, Dutchman Gijs van Lennep, will be reunited with his victorious 911 Carrera RSR during the weekend. Belgian ace Jacky Ickx will drive an example of the Porsche 959 Rally-Raid car, and Richard Attwood, winner of the 1970 Le Mans 24 Hour race in the fearsome Porsche 917, will also be competing.</p>

<p>And for visitors wishing to re-fuel themselves, the Porsche Caf&#233; Le Mans will be once more situated on the outside of the track near the footbridge, offering meals and refreshments.</p>

<p>The Goodwood Festival of Speed takes place in the grounds of Goodwood House, near Chichester, Sussex, between July 7 &#8211; 9. Admission is by advanced ticket only. For further information about the weekend&#8217;s activities and admission prices, visit goodwood.co.uk, or telephone 01243 755000.</p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Mitsubishi Motors will use the 2006 Paris Motor Show in September to launch its all-new European SUV, the Outlander.  Due to go on-sale spring 2007, the new mid-size 4x4 has been designed to bring new levels of comfort and drivability to an important and expanding sector of the market.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50663-a-mit+.jpg" width="350" height="261" alt="Mitsubishi Outlander" align="left" /><br />
70 years of 4x4 technology</p>

<p>Seventy years after its seminal PX33 4 wheel-drive torpedo, MMC will be able to demonstrate in Paris its expertise in this area through a coherent, up-to-the-minute and totally renewed SUV line-up, filling key sectors of the growing SUV market in Europe.</p>

<p>After the successful launch of its L200 sport-utility-truck earlier this year and prior to another most important introduction, Mitsubishi Motors will unveil &#8220;Outlander-Concept&#8221; in Paris.</p>

<p>Best selling compact SUV</p>

<p>A derivative of the all-new Outlander launched in Japan in October 2005 and now the best selling compact SUV in Japan (20,041 sales October 2005 / May 2006), Outlander-Concept will preview the upcoming Euro-spec. Outlander.</p>

<p>To be launched in Europe during the first quarter of 2007, Outlander will allow Mitsubishi Motors to enter the fastest growing SUV segment (up 54% from 325,000 in 2001 to 500,000 in 2006 and with further 35% growth expected between 2006 and 2009), right in the heart of this sector.</p>

<p>Outlander-Concept will also preview in Europe an all-new global C-segment platform that MMC has engineered for world markets, plus advanced technology based on Mitsubishi Motors&#8217; AWC (All Wheel Control) concept and proven through its motor sport activities.</p>

<p>A new dimension</p>

<p>Legitimate by heritage, Outlander-Concept proposes a new dimension to an increasingly crowded and predictable segment through design, technology and features:</p>

<p>- Design:           With its Europe-only &#8220;Mount Fuji&#8221; grille, the 4.64 m long Outlander-Concept is a further showcase of Mitsubishi Motors&#8217; strong visual identity, while its wide stance, muscular fenders and sharp lines leave no doubt about its dynamic abilities.</p>

<p>Lean, Outlander-Concept brings drama without gratuitous effects, its kicked-up window line, piercing headlamps and 20&#8221; specific wheels giving the appearance of permanent motion.</p>

<p>It will be presented in a sporty metallic red with silver accents (roof rails, side body strips, door handles, front skid-plate, grille surround).<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50663mit+.jpg" width="350" height="261" alt="Mitsubishi Outlander" align="right" /><br />
- Technology:     Neither an authentic off-roader like Pajero* nor a jacked-up station wagon, Outlander-Concept is a no-compromise solution for a different type of recreational vehicle. Using the in-built adaptability of MMC&#8217;s new global platform, it brings passenger car-like levels of active safety and driving pleasure, whilst its Mitsubishi &#8220;All Wheel Control&#8221; drive system allows a smooth progression off the beaten tracks, up to a &#8220;Lock 4WD&#8221; mode.</p>

<p>Outlander-Concept is powered by a derivative of the Volkswagen AG-supplied 1,968 cc, turbo-charged w/intercooler, DOHC, 16-valve, EU-4 compliant Diesel engine fitted to the recent Grandis Di-D. Mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox, in Outlander-Concept it produces an estimated 103kW / 140 ps.</p>

<p>- Features:        Flexible in essence, Outlander-Concept has been designed as a stylish living space, able to suit all requirements and with features to match, be it entertainment (650W 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate&#174; premium audio system), seating (clever &#8220;Hide&amp;Seat&#212;&#8221; 3rd row for 5+2 accommodation) or utility (split tailgate and auto-folding function for the 2nd row seats).</p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>HUMMER will make its UK debut at the British International Motor Show at London&#8217;s ExCeL with a display featuring the legendary HUMMER H2 and the new, midsize, HUMMER H3 which is due to become available with right-hand drive during 2007.</p>

<p>HUMMER H2<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/50645hum+.jpg" width="350" height="262" alt="H2 Hummer" align="left" /><br />
The left-hand drive HUMMER H2 provides a unique combination of unrivalled off-road capability and on-road comfort, with a fully welded ladder-type frame chassis that features a modular, three-piece design incorporating a number of hydroformed components. The result is outstanding strength, stiffness and dimensional accuracy. Ensuring on-road ride comfort and control, as well as off-road capability, is the standard independent front torsion bar and five-link coil spring rear suspension. The solid rear axle ensures durable sure-footedness, particularly in tight, off-road situations. A self-leveling rear air spring suspension system is available for severe off-road and towing requirements.</p>

<p>The H2 has short overhangs for radical approach and departure angles, and exceptional ground clearance for minimal impact on trails. The 17-inch wheels and heavy-duty suspension provide superior handling, carrying and towing capability.</p>

<p>H2's power is derived from the Vortec 6000 6.0 litre V8 that produces 325 horsepower (242 kw) at 5200 rpm and 488 Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. The engine is mated to a heavy-duty Hydra-Matic 4L65-E four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. H2 also features a, powertrain-integrated Borg-Warner two-speed electrically controlled full-time 4WD system, which is capable of further reducing H2's gear ratios by 2.64:1 when necessary, for highly controlled obstacle climbing.</p>

<p>A Bosch four-channel anti-lock braking/traction control system (ABS/TCS) provides optimum control on slippery surfaces. In addition, the ABS can detect and adjust its braking capabilities to rough off-road surfaces like gravel and potholes. The TCS also includes the ability to gain traction through a single wheel where necessary and permit additional wheel slip in the traction control mode for sand and desert racing conditions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>HUMMER H3</p>

<p>The latest addition to the growing HUMMER range, the HUMMER H3, delivers authentic HUMMER style and off-road capability in a more accessible, midsize package. Compared with the H2, the left-hand drive H3 is 429 mm shorter, 152 mm lower and 165 mm narrower.</p>

<p>Powered by the Vortec 3500 engine with dual overhead cams and variable valve timing, this 3.5 litre in-line five-cylinder unit produces 220 horsepower (162 kw) at 5600 rpm and 305 Nm of torque at 2800 rpm.</p>

<p>H3 is the first HUMMER to offer the choice of transmission &#8211; either a standard, smooth-shifting five-speed manual transmission or a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission.</p>

<p>At the heart of the H3 is the electronically controlled four-wheel-drive system. The system is augmented with features such as traction control, underbody shielding, an optional rear locking differential and StabiliTrak stability control with the automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The H3&#8217;s manoeuvrable size results in a 11.3 m turning circle. The 231 mm ground clearance and maximum break-over angle of 25 degrees both make it possible to clear large obstacles in off-road driving. Serious off-road performance is also aided by the maximum approach angle of 40 degrees and maximum departure angle of 37 degrees.</p>

<p>Starting in the fourth quarter of 2006, the HUMMER H3 will be assembled at a second location, the General Motors plant in Struandale, South Africa. The additional volume is scheduled for markets in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. A right-hand drive version of the H3 will be added to the South African production in early 2007, to be followed by an optional diesel engine later. General Motors South Africa will be the only manufacturing site outside of the United States to assemble the HUMMER H3. Production of the H3 began in spring 2005 at GM&#8217;s Shreveport, Louisiana, plant in the United States.</p>

<p>HUMMER SALES</p>

<p>The global expansion of the HUMMER brand has seen sales nearly double in 2005 (61,000 2005; 31,000 units in 2004). While much of this growth was led by the H3 in the United States of America, HUMMER also saw significant expansion in Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Middle East. Details of the official HUMMER licencee in the UK, Bauer Millett, can be found on <a href="http://www.bauer-millett.com">www.bauer-millett.com</a></p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Gaydon, Warwickshire, 26 June 2006 &#8211; Land Rover is to take part in the Goodwood Festival of Speed for the first time in the 4x4 manufacturer's 59 year history and is set to make a big impression on festival goers with a dramatic display of off-road action.</p>

<p>First up is the Land Rover G4 Challenge off-road circuit, which is situated in the main showground, featuring the Discovery 3, Range Rover Sport and a special guest vehicle (to be announced on the Sunday of the festival), all of which are available for passenger rides. The circuit is from the Copa Cabana special stage of the 2006 G4 Challenge in Rio de Janeiro, where the challenge set for competitors was to complete the course without putting a wheel on the sand of the world famous beach.</p>

<p>Next is a special Bowler Off-Road 'systems development' Range Rover Sport, which will be used in the 'Heroes of World Rallying' section of the famous Goodwood hill climb. This vehicle has been specially prepared for the action by the specialist motorsport team at Bowler Off-Road.</p>

<p>The Bowler Off-Road team will also be making its mark at the Festival, with the announcement of their all-new race car, the Bowler Nemesis. Inspired by Land Rover's Range Rover Sport, this vehicle has been designed and engineered exclusively by the Bowler Off-Road team at their Derbyshire base. Images and further information on the Bowler Nemesis and the limited edition Range Rover Sport HST will be available at the Bowler Off-Road stand.</p>

<p>Land Rover UK managing director, John Edwards, said: "With the Range Rover Sport now firmly in our stable, we have good reason to be at the Festival of Speed.</p>

<p>Between Land Rover on the off-road circuit, and Bowler on the hill climb, we will show that our vehicles have the breadth of capability to do just about anything."</p>

<p>The Goodwood Festival of Speed is open from Friday 7 July to Sunday 9 July 2006.</p>

Isuzu (UK) Limited has joined forces with Constitution Motors and Hammonds of Halesworth, to promote the multi-award winning trio of Rodeo Denver 3.0 Automatic, Denver Max 3.0 and the Denver Max LE 3.0 at the Royal Norfolk Show on 28 and 29 June.</p>

<p>Exhibiting for the first time at the Show, billed as the largest of its kind in the UK and attracting nearly 100,000 visitors, staff will be on hand to show off the latest models and best deals in town. These include the five-seat, four-door double cab Rodeo Denver automatic, priced at only &#163;13,990 on-the-road (excl VAT).</p>

<p>The offer is limited to models in Silver only and makes the Rodeo the best-value one-tonner on the market.</p>

<p>Standard equipment on the 3.0 litre turbo diesel Rodeo Denver includes: alloy wheels, air-conditioning, leather-wrapped steering wheel, radio/CD player, electric windows, ABS with EBD and three-point seatbelts for all five occupants.</p>

<p>The Rodeo Denver has won praise for its car-like driving characteristics and the optional Prodrive Performance Pack is proving highly popular. This boosts power from 130 PS to 155 PS at 3,800 rpm with torque growing from 206.5 lb ft to a solid 258.1 lb ft at the same 2,000 rpm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Rodeo continues to win accolades including Japan&#8217;s 2005 &#8216;Good Design Award&#8217;, &#8216;Best Double Cab Pickup&#8217; from Used Car Buyer magazine and &#8216;Lifestyle Pickup Winner&#8217; from 4x4 magazine. Other awards include one from The Caravan Club and another from What Van? magazine.</p>

<p>With more than 600 trade stands, displaying the latest in farm machinery, livestock and local produce, it&#8217;s no wonder more and more people are flocking to the area every year - there is something for all the family.</p>

<p>Come and see us on stand 462, Avenue 16, facing east.</p>

<p>          o New Carens and facelifted Sorento unveiled<br />
          o Kia displays new cee&#8217;d concept<br />
          o Stand 8, South Hall</p>

<p>A whole host of bold new Kia models are being unveiled to the UK for the first time at the British International Motor Show at ExCel in London&#8217;s docklands on 18 July.</p>

<p>The range of new models which have never before been seen in the UK, include the stunning all-new Carens mid-range MPV, the new facelifted Sorento 4x4, and the stunning cee&#8217;d concept vehicle.</p>

<p>The rest of Kia&#8217;s exciting range will also be on show as the company gives show-goers a peek into its future and clearly illustrates its bold way forward.</p>

<p>The new Kia Carens is larger and more stylish than the out-going model. Smart and exciting, it has been designed especially with British and European drivers in mind and looks set to be one of the London show&#8217;s big stars. Available as a five or seven seater, Carens will re-work the terms space, convenience and versatility.</p>

<p>The new Kia Sedona MPV, which made its world premiere at this year&#8217;s Geneva Motor Show, will go on sale in the UK on 1 July. Like Carens, the Sedona has been redesigned from the ground up and has been created especially for European drivers. With seven individual seats, mounted in a 2+3+2 layout, all five middle and back row seats can be individually moved, reclined, folded or removed for maximum space and minimum fuss.</p>

<p>Also making its UK debut at ExCel is the cee&#8217;d concept car (pronounced &#8216;seed&#8217;), based on the forthcoming all-new C-segment model which goes into production at the new factory in Slovakia in December. The stunning new model marks the beginning of a whole new era in Kia's design ethos, and has a tough appearance, flowing lines, jewel-like detailing and a solid stance.</p>

<p>Among the other stars planned for Kia&#8217;s brilliant stand are the Kia Picanto city car, the all-new Rio spacious supermini, the roomy Cerato family model, the European-standard Magentis large saloon and the sophisticated Sportage mid-sized 4x4.</p>

<p>"Kia&#8217;s stand at this British Motor Show will be one of the best ever seen on UK soil," said Paul Williams, Managing Director, Kia Motors UK. "The broad and exciting range of cars we now have to show, coupled with the reveal of the new Carens and Sorento, make our stand a must-visit, for journalists and for the thousands of show-goers planning a visit to Docklands.</p>

<p>"We are very excited about this year&#8217;s event and I&#8217;m sure that we will have something for everyone on the Kia stand."</p>

<p>* All-new L200 range to take centre stage at CV Show in April</p>

<p>* Full range of working and lifestyle variants on display</p>

<p>* L200 Tipper concept on show to test opinion</p>

<p>The complete new L200 pick-up range will take centre stage on the Mitsubishi stand at the 2006 Commercial Vehicle show in April. In both single and double cab form, all variants of the stunning new pick-up will be available to peruse from the practical 4Work right through to the more extravagant Animal.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard range, Mitsubishi Motors UK will also take the opportunity to test an L200 Tipper concept vehicle with visitors to the show. Whilst on display, Mitsubishi product managers will gather feedback and evaluate demand in order to decide whether to add it as a new member of the UK line-up.</p>

<p>Officially on sale from the beginning of March, demand for the new L200 pick-up has already outstripped initial supply with 1,500 orders being taken before the demonstrators had reached the dealer showroom floors. A combination of keen pricing, generous specification, technical advancements and stunning styling have captured the buying public&#8217;s imagination. With new supplies already on their way, Mitsubishi looks set to record an all-new pick-up sales record in 2006.</p>

<p>As well as the pick-up, Mitsubishi will also show the practical and value-packed Shogun and Shogun Sport commercial vehicles. The 4x4 commercial vehicle sector (excluding pick-up) is a niche market but one that has been steadily growing for Mitsubishi Motors UK, fuelled by the creation of a one-stop-shop for specialist fleet customer conversions at its Head Office in Cirencester. This facility allows customers to place their order along with conversion requirements - ranging from lights and stripes and racking systems to heavy duty winches - and have the vehicle kitted out and delivered ready to go to work. Customers making use of this facility have been the Forestry Commission, Environment Agency, Orange, BT and numerous police forces.</p>

	<p>Tokyo, March 29 2006 &#8212; Mitsubishi Motors will announce the North American market version of the Outlander SUV model at the upcoming New York Auto Show. Launched in Japan in October last year, Outlander brings a new-feel product concept that marries mainline SUV functionality and design with sedan-like handling and ride. Outlander has enjoyed strong popularity among Japanese consumers with orders reaching about 20,000 units for the new model in the 5.5 months since its launch &#8212; well exceeding the 2,000 unit monthly sales target. To be held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Centre, the New York International Automobile Show opens to the press and media on April 12 and to the general public on April 14.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/290306mit+.jpg" width="350" height="220" alt="Mitsubishi Outlander" align="left" /></p>

<p>The North American Outlander will be powered by a new high performance, low emissions, and low fuel consumption 3-liter V6 MIVEC*1 engine together with a 6-speed automatic transmission to deliver outstanding acceleration and high-speed cruising performance.</p>

<p>The new Outlander offers a choice of drive formats: the electronically controlled 4WD system that has received high acclaim in Japan; and a front-wheel drive version specially tailored to the North American market.</p>

<p>As on the Japan market model, the new Outlander will use a newly design high-rigidity platform that realizes improved impact safety and an aluminium roof panel that lowers centre of gravity and reduces roll inertia for improved handling performance and ride. Outlander also offers outstanding utility performance with a split tailgate ("Flap-fold tailgate") that facilitates the loading of different sizes and weights of luggage and with an available 7-seat layout that features two occasional-use third row seats stored flat under the floor ("Underfloor-stowable compact 3rd row seat"). Outlander also features Mitsubishi's Sportronic steering wheel paddle shifters that allow the driver to change gear manually without having to take his hand off the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Mitsubishi Motors began revamping its car engine line-up in 2004 to a common theme of high performance, low fuel consumption, low weight, and compact size. The new 3-liter V6 MIVEC engine powering the North American Outlander is the fourth new engine in this theme, following the 4A9-type 4-cylinder 1.3 and 1.5-liter units that power the European Colt launched in May 2004 (and the Japanese Colt from October 2004), the 4B1-type 4-cylinder 2.4-liter unit that powers the Japanese Outlander launched in October 2005 and the 3B2-type 3-cylinder 660cc engine that powers the i minicar launched in Japan in January this year.</p>


<p>Like the other members of the new engine line-up the 3-liter V6 MIVEC engine incorporates many advanced features including an aluminium cylinder block, a resin variable air induction system, and Mitsubishi's own MIVEC variable valve timing system to generate best-in-class output and torque. The new power unit achieves this higher performance while being about 25 kg lighter, and realizing about 5% better fuel economy, than its 6G7-type 3-liter V6 predecessor. In addition, the use of a high-performance catalytic converter means that the North American Outlander is expected to receive the Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (PZEV) designation under California emissions standards (according to in house testing).</p>

<p>The Outlander will be joined at the New York International Automobile Show by 9 other models including the new Eclipse Spyder convertible and the 2007 special edition Galant Ralliart mid-size luxury sports sedan due to go on sale this autumn.</p>

<p>Other Mitsubishi Motors models on display at New York International Automobile Show</p>

<p>1. Mitsubishi Concept-X<br />
Unveiled for the first time in North America, the Mitsubishi Concept-X concept model embodies all the exciting qualities of Mitsubishi's hallmark "Driving Pleasure." Exhibited at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show, Concept-X combines Mitsubishi's advanced 4WD-based Super All Wheel Control (S-AWC*2) vehicle dynamics control system with cool styling that raises the bar on performance looks.</p>

<p>2. Mitsubishi Concept-CT MIEV<br />
The Mitsubishi Concept-CT MIEV 4WD concept car had its world premiere at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This sports compact concept model uses outer-rotor type in-wheel motors and a high energy density lithium-ion battery system to drive all four wheels together with a gasoline engine in a series-parallel hybrid configuration that delivers higher power and an extended cruising range.</p>

<p>3. Galant Ralliart<br />
Mitsubishi Motors introduced the new Galant exclusively to the North American market in 2003. The mid-size luxury sports sedan features generous and comfortable interior space and an exterior design that gives the car a distinctive road presence.<br />
The 2007 model year Galant Ralliart on display at the New York Auto Show is distinguished by detail changes that give the exterior an even sportier appearance. Changes that raise Galant Ralliart's road performance include a 3.8-liter V6 engine, sports suspension and 18-inch alloy road wheels.</p>

<p>4. Eclipse Spyder<br />
Eclipse Spyder is the open-top version of the Eclipse coupe introduced in 2005 and acclaimed for its sporty performance and dynamic styling. Refinements defining the new third-generation Eclipse Spyder include an automatic soft top that smoothly folds away under a new flush-fitting tonneau panel. Eclipse Spyder is offered in two trim levels: the GT - powered by a 3.8-liter V6 MIVEC engine, and the GS - powered by a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder MIVEC unit.</p>

<p>*1 MIVEC: Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control system</p>

<p>*2 S-AWC: Built around 4WD mechanics, this vehicle dynamics control system integrates control of drive, braking, steering and suspension systems.</p>

RAV4 SPORTS</p>

<p>* High-performance sports conversion</p>

<p>* Based on flagship RAV4 T180 with D-4D 180 engine tuned to deliver 201bhp (204 DIN hp) and 450Nm of torque</p>

<p>* Aerodynamic body kit</p>

<p>* Lowered suspension and larger brakes</p>

<p>There is no mistaking the intention of the RAV4 Sports concept, with a beefed-up exterior that includes new bumpers, grille and integrated front fog lights. At the front there is large intake set in above the front protection plate, with a matching plate at the back housing the neatly faired-in exhaust.</p>

<p>To the side there are deep side skirts for enhanced aerodynamic performance and the 21-inch alloy wheels fill the wheel arches to the limit, fitted with 255/35 R21 tyres front and rear.</p>

<p>The 175bhp (177 DIN hp) 2.2-litre D-4D 180 common rail diesel engine, which in standard form is already the most powerful engine in its class, is specially tuned for the RAV4 Sports to deliver 201bhp (204 DIN hp) and 450 Nm of torque.</p>

<p>To meet the demands of the uprated engine, air cooling capacity is increased with a larger front grille and additional air intakes in the bonnet. Braking performance is also greater, with perforated discs with six-piston callipers at the front and four-piston callipers at the rear. The suspension is stiffer and lower compared to the regular T180, with reinforced shock absorbers to ensure the Sports can take the rough as well as the smooth.</p>

<p>Dark tinted glass ensures privacy for those on board, while the Liquid Metal exterior colour has been created exclusively for the model.<br />

* All-new seven-seater Santa Fe<br />
* World debut for Genus concept premium crossover model</p>

<p>Two major new models are taking centre stage on the Hyundai stand at this week&#8217;s Geneva Motor Show, representing both key elements in its current major product initiative and a vision of the kind of vehicle that will be meeting motorists&#8217; desires in the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p>&#8216;SEVEN-UP&#8217; FOR NEW SANTA FE</p>

<p>The all-new Santa Fe SUV, which is set to reach UK showrooms later this year, makes its first European appearance at Geneva. The larger dimensions of this second-generation model enable it to offer seven-seat accommodation &#8211; a major advance for the Santa Fe range.</p>

<p>Passenger comfort and on-road handling have been improved, while the new styling is tailored specifically to appeal to European tastes. These qualities combine an impressive package, supported by Hyundai&#8217;s trademark quality, performance, reliability and style.</p>

<p>The new Santa Fe will be offered with an upgraded version of Hyundai&#8217;s top-performing 2.7-litre V6 petrol engine, plus a 2.2-litre common rail diesel with Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) for smooth power delivery and excellent fuel economy.<br />
FIRST VIEW OF HYUNDAI GENUS CONCEPT</p>

<p>Genus is a new Hyundai concept vehicle that makes its world debut at Geneva. It is a premium crossover model, designed to bring together the sporting dynamism of a coupe and the versatility of an estate car.</p>

<p>Genus has been created by Hyundai&#8217;s European design centre in R&#252;sselsheim, Germany, with styling inspired by the natural forms of waves and sand dunes. As a concept, it previews the type of vehicle Hyundai believes will respond to the developing customer tastes and expectations in the upper medium D-segment.</p>

<p>Daihatsu&#8217;s striking new Terios 4x4 sport utility makes its debut at &#8216;The 76th Geneva International Motor Show&#8217; heralding an exciting new direction for the Japanese compact car specialist.</p>

<p>On sale in the UK in early May, the totally new Terios follows on from last year&#8217;s new Sirion in offering a strong European flavour to its styling, packaging and dynamics.</p>

<p>As a result, Daihatsu aims to boost European sales from the 32,000 of 2003 to 80,000 in 2008.</p>

<p>And so confident is parent company, Toyota, of the new Terios&#8217;s appeal that it plans to sell 1,500 per month of its version in Japan, badged &#8216;Rush&#8217;.</p>

<p>The home-market Daihatsu equivalent is named &#8216;Be-go&#8217; with a monthly goal of 500 units.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daihatsu&#8217;s UK sales rose by more than 71 per cent in January &#8211; the seventh consecutive month of growth. Traditionally its best seller, Daihatsu expects the new Terios to regain this position although there are already worldwide supply constraints due to its success in Japan.</p>

<p>The new Terios UK line-up will comprise the Terios 1.5 S available in Black Mica only at &#163;12,995 on-the-road, the higher-spec 1.5 SX at &#163;14,295 OTR &#8211; expected to be the best-seller &#8211; and the 1.5 SE automatic at &#163;14,995 OTR.</p>

<p>The latter two models are offered in Black Mica, Blue Mica, Grey Metallic, Silver Metallic or Red.</p>

<p>Daihatsu&#8217;s press conference is at 1.15 pm on the first press day of &#8216;The 76th Geneva International Motor Show&#8217;, Tuesday, 28 February.</p>

<p>Dynamic Design, Convincing Credentials</p>

<p>Arguably the most stylish small 4x4 on the market, the totally new Terios has a dynamic, fun-to-drive appearance with strong off-road styling cues yet short front and rear overhangs, a long wheelbase and especially wide tracks and body width.</p>

<p>Its roomy, four-door, five-seat body succeeds in being compact yet practical, avoiding the bulk, high fuel consumption and negative image of some 4x4s.</p>

<p>Designed to appeal to young families and older people seeking the traditional 4x4 qualities of visibility, bad-weather traction and versatility, the new Terios also offers small car running costs and manoeuvrability.</p>

<p>Its turning circle is a tight 9.8 metres (kerb-to-kerb) for the S and SE and a still hatchback-like 10 metres for the bigger-tyred SX, while the SX body length is between that of the new Renault Clio and larger Megane.</p>

<p>Compared to the previous model, the new Terios 1.5 SX is 230 mm longer at 4,075 mm and a significant 190 mm wider at 1,745 mm. It is 45 mm higher but purely because of its standard roof rails. The entry-level &#8216;S&#8217; model &#8211; which lacks roof rails &#8211; is actually 5 mm lower than before.</p>

<p>Greatly boosting the new Terios&#8217;s tough, stable stance are front and rear tracks measuring 1,450 and 1,480 mm respectively &#8211; a massive 145 and 170 mm greater than before. Meanwhile, the wheelbase &#8211; at 2,580 mm &#8211; grows by 180 mm.</p>

<p>Complementing this are especially large 16 ins wheels for all models with either 215/65R tyres for the entry-level Terios 1.5 S manual and higher-spec SE automatic or beefy 235/60R tyres for the manual SX.</p>

<p>Versatile Interior</p>

<p>The versatile interior offers mid-sized hatchback passenger space with a clever split fold-and-tumble rear seat which liberates a 1,290 mm maximum floor length &#8211; long enough to take a mountain bike.</p>

<p>Even with the rear seat in use the 380 litre capacity boot is capable of taking four 45" golf bags, four vertically-stacked mid-sized suitcases or a typical baby buggy. Most models also have load-floor securing hooks.</p>

<p>Sprightly, Efficient Powertrain</p>

<p>Based on the Sirion&#8217;s 1.3 litre DOHC 16-valve petrol engine, the new Terios has a larger 1.5 litre capacity, producing 105 PS at 6,000 rpm and a flexible 103 lb. ft of torque at 4,400 rpm.</p>

<p>Its standard Dynamic Variable Valve Timing (DVVT) enhances low-speed pulling power and high rev throttle response by maximising combustion efficiency. It also boosts fuel economy and lowers exhaust emissions.</p>

<p>The new Terios&#8217;s engine &#8211; with the same 72 mm bore as the 1.3 litre but a longer 91.8 mm stroke &#8211; is both lively and flexible, requiring fewer gear-changes to make sprightly progress.</p>

<p>For example, its torque curve is virtually flat between 3,200 and 4,000 rpm &#8211; the most frequently used rev-range in normal driving.</p>

<p>Top speed for manual models is almost 100 mph and over 93 mph for the automatic, while the Terios 1.5 S manual records 40.4 mpg on the Extra Urban Cycle and the Terios 1.5 SE automatic not far behind at 39.8 mpg.</p>

<p>The new Terios 1.5 S manual has a low CO2 reading of 186 g/km with the Terios 1.5 SE automatic recording 196 g/km.</p>

<p>In fact, the Terios 1.5 S has the best CO2 reading of any four-door 4x4 &#8211; diesel included &#8211; and comfortably beats rivals such as the Suzuki Grand Vitara, Mitsubishi Shogun Pinin and Honda HR-V.</p>

<p>The short-throw five-speed manual gearchange is light and slick, while the four-speed automatic is both quick-reacting yet capable of selecting a higher gear during more gentle driving, aiding fuel economy and refinement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all new Terios models have a full-time 4WD system with a fixed 50/50 front to rear torque-split and centre differential which eliminates axle wind-up &#8211; the phenomenon of the steering becoming increasingly heavy on full-lock.</p>

<p>Because of this 50/50 torque split, high-speed stability and slippery surface traction is greatly enhanced compared to most rivals. These models are usually rear-wheel drive with selectable 4WD or effectively front wheel-drive, only calling on 4WD when sensors detect wheelspin.</p>

<p>A fascia-mounted switch activates the electronically-controlled differential-lock. This further aids traction in mud or deep snow, while short front and rear overhangs and a 190 mm ground clearance also signal serious off-road ability. The new Terios has a front approach angle of 38 degrees with a rear of 37 degrees.</p>

<p>The compact engine is mounted in-line, followed by the gearbox. A centre differential transfers torque to both the front and rear axles via two separate propeller shafts.</p>

<p>Sporty Handling From New Chassis</p>

<p>The new Terios benefits from a totally new monocoque platform with a revised chassis tuned for car-like, confidence-inspiring handling with vastly improved ride and stability compared to the previous model.</p>

<p>Aided by its considerably wider front and rear tracks, the new Terios features front MacPherson struts, lower wishbones and an anti-roll bar.</p>

<p>The five-link rear suspension has variable-rate coil springs and near vertical rear shock-absorbers which improve damping and therefore comfort, pitch and roll.</p>

<p>Compared to the old Terios, the front anti-roll bar is of a new design, the revised hydraulic power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering gear achieves excellent accuracy and feel, while the bump stops better control axle articulation.</p>

<p>In addition, an increased shock-absorber rebound stroke improves rough terrain driveability.</p>

<p>At the rear, a new lateral rod reduces axle squirm and benefits refinement, a newly-designed upper control arm enhances stability, a new shock-absorber reduces brake judder and a longer suspension stroke improves ride comfort.</p>

<p>Other rear suspension improvements include a more compact design resulting in a lower boot floor and a new design of spring and lower control arm which reduce rear differential noise.</p>

<p>Outstanding Safety Measures</p>

<p>The new Terios has outstanding safety measures with in-house tests giving results equal to a Euro NCAP 4-Star occupant protection and 3-Star pedestrian protection.</p>

<p>Crushable structures are used at the front and rear of the body with the cabin itself made stronger to minimise occupant injury. To protect from side-impacts, the front floor cross-member, tunnel, sills, B-posts and roof-side rails are all strengthened to secure occupant survival space.</p>

<p>As for pedestrians, the front bumper and bonnet are designed to minimise injury to the head and thigh with a shock-absorbing structure built into the bonnet.</p>

<p>High-power seatbelt pretensioners are standard while special pads are installed to reduce injury to occupant knees, torso and lower legs. The pedals are also designed not to intrude during an impact.</p>

<p>Both driver, passenger and side airbags are fitted and the standard four-channel anti-lock brakes (ABS) also feature electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) which maximises stopping power and minimises skidding.</p>

<p>Outstanding Equipment</p>

<p>Every new Terios model has an outstanding equipment tally with the entry-level Terios 1.5 S featuring air-conditioning, power-steering, ABS with EBD, full-time four-wheel drive with centre diff-lock, driver, passenger and side airbags, three rear-seat three-point seatbelts, radio/CD player, four electric windows and reverse parking sensors.</p>

<p>Expected to be the best-seller, the Terios 1.5 SX adds, for example, alloy wheels with 235/60R tyres, two-tone wheelarch extensions and side-skirts, roof rails, multi-information display, front fog-lamps, smoked &#8216;privacy glass&#8217; for the rear side doors and rear window, leather steering wheel, electric windscreen de-icer and door mirrors and various AC sockets and load-restraint ties.</p>

<p>The automatic transmission-only Terios 1.5 SE has a similar equipment level to the SX but features a different design of alloy wheel with 215/65 tyres and has colour-keyed side skirts.</p>

<p>Like all Daihatsus, the new Terios will enjoy the protection of a three-year unlimited mileage warranty with roadside assistance plus an eight-year anti-perforation warranty.</p>

	<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/cpg132/albums/userpics/10001/volvoconcept.jpg" alt="Volvo XC70 Concept" title="Volvo XC70 Concept" /><br />
Volvo Cars of North America, (VCNA) has revealed two exciting new concept cars at the 2005 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) tradeshow in Las Vegas, Nevada, continuing a trend established in recent years. Painted a glittering Saffron colour reminiscent of a desert sunset, the 'XC70 AT' (All Terrain) takes the production Volvo XC70 to the off-road extreme.</p>

<p>The XC70 AT is inspired by the legendary, tough off-road Baja race. It features the 2.5-litre, 5-cylinder turbo engine that is normally found in the high performance V70 R. But where the V70 R makes an impressive 300 bhp, the XC70 AT, with its Garrett GT2835R turbocharger and ipd/MTE Stage III software upgrade makes 408 bhp at 6,200 rpm. Keeping the hot-blooded engine cool is an Aquamist in-cylinder intercooling system and an extra large top-mounted intercooler. Low restriction 3-inch stainless steel exhaust pipes emit a husky sound.</p>

<p>Producing an amazing 398 lb-ft of torque at a low 4,000 rpm, the XC70 AT uses the same 6-speed automatic transmission that is standard in the XC90 V8 (available in USA) and the 2006 V70 R. Making sure all four wheels get the most of the broad torque curve is Volvo&#8217;s fully automatic all-wheel-drive system by Haldex with Instant Traction.</p>

<p>The XC70 AT takes Volvo's Four-C active chassis to the next level with a custom fully independent air ride suspension offering 4-inches of adjustability via dash-mounted buttons. Add in a 4-inch lift kit and the XC70 AT can ride up to 8 inches higher than the standard production Volvo XC70. To keep body roll in check, 25 mm front and 28 mm rear anti-roll bars have been fitted.</p>

<p>Additional accessories include a 1,000 watt generator, high-lift jack, spare jerry can and tyre and remote exterior battery terminal connections</p>

		New Grand Vitara Unveiled at Frankfurt		&nbsp;-&nbsp;
		Categories: <strong><a href="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/index.php?cat=16" title="Browse category">Manufacturers</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/index.php?cat=20" title="Browse category">Motor Shows</a>		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>You could tell that the new Grand Vitara is important to Suzuki even before they unveiled it.<br />
<img src="http://frankfurt.cars.msn.co.uk/images/frankfurt05/cars/suzuki_4_ad_380.jpg" alt="Suzuki Grand Vitara" title="Suzuki Grand Vitara" align="left" /><br />
Before the start of most presentations a stand might have one or maybe two interesting new shapes under wraps; the Suzuki stand was almost completely filled with sheeted three- and five-door clones of the car to be revealed, seemingly with every possible major engine and transmission variation.</p>

<p>And they had Toshihiro Suzuki from the main board to introduce the new car to us &#8211; because just as for most of the latest Japanese product, the European market and Germany in particular, are vital to the new car&#8217;s success.</p>

<p>As the third generation, it has a lot to follow: the original Vitara was introduced in 1988 and the first Grand Vitara in the late 1990s &#8211; since when the Vitara family has sold some 1.9 million cars, and the majority of those in Europe.</p>

<p>Suzuki think of this as their second &#8216;world production model&#8217; (the first was the new Swift) and describe it as &#8216;a fast SUV for a driver with a go-for-it attitude&#8217;. They also say it&#8217;s for enthusiasts who live their lives to the full, whatever they are doing, and who want to live life rather than just watching it go by.</p>

<p>So the all-new Grand Vitara looks chunkily sporty, and a lot of the focus is on its technical detail and drivability. It is based on a combination of monocoque shell with additional lightweight ladder frame underneath, to give maximum stiffness, especially in off-road situations. It has near perfect 50:50 weight distribution, all-independent suspension including a new multi-link rear layout, and four-mode full-time four-wheel drive &#8211; including a Neutral mode for if you&#8217;re towing it long distances, say behind your motorhome when you&#8217;re heading into the hills on vacation. They say this new &#8216;Off-Road Athlete&#8217; is environmentally friendly, too.</p>

	<p>Opel Antara GTC Study: New Sporty SUV Interpretation<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/antara.jpg" width="320" height="213" alt="Vauxhall Antara" align="left" /><br />
Extraordinary world premiere for an extraordinary study<br />
Further world premieres: Astra TwinTop, Vectra OPC models, Zafira CNG<br />
First public presentation of new Vectra and Signum on Opel stand in hall 8</p>


<p>R&#252;sselsheim/Frankfurt. A celebratory IAA premiere that was as extraordinary as the car itself: on Monday evening in the Bockenheimer Depot, Alain Visser, Executive Director, European Marketing, and Bryan Nesbitt, Executive Director, Design, General Motors Europe unveiled the Antara GTC (Gran Turismo Crossover) study, in the presence of GM`s top management including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner and Vice Chairman Bob Lutz. The objective: to show just how dynamic and athletic an SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) can now look, with this four-wheel drive Opel concept vehicle. It was then transported to the exhibition site overnight, for its world premiere on the Opel stand in hall 8. With the distinctive three-door Antara GTC, Opel presents the public a new, particularly sporty SUV interpretation, as well as the brand's dynamic design language in this special vehicle format.</p>

<p>With striking LED headlamps that stretch into the fenders, and typical Opel crease in the engine hood, the front of the four-seater (length/width/height: 4530/1970/1640 mm) accentuates Opel's new design line. The side profile is highlighted by the frameless windows that drop right down and contribute to the coup&#233;-like silhouette. With a number of visual and technical details, as well as typical Opel versatility in the interior, the study also sets out to satisfy demanding practical requirements. The tailgate, for example, has a pantographic hinge. Thanks to this innovative design, it swings upwards and to the front when it is opened, so that the person loading the vehicle is not forced to take a step backwards. This provides more convenient access to the load compartment. The two rear seats can be completely folded away from the rear of the vehicle, producing a totally flat loading area. The front seats are anchored on mono-rails and therefore look as if they are floating. With the aid of an EasyEntry system, they slide forward up to the instrument panel at the touch of a button to allow the passengers easier entry to the rear.</p>

<p>Beneath the hood, the Antara GTC features a 212 hp twin-turbo version of the 1.9 CDTI four-cylinder engine. The transversely-installed concept unit produces 400 Nm from<br />
1400 rpm and, like all 1.9 CDTI engines in Opel models, is equipped with a maintenance-free Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). In combination with the six-speed automatic transmission, the performance is outstanding: computer simulations show a top speed of over 210 km/h and acceleration from zero to 100 km/h in around 8 seconds.</p>

<p>Open-air feeling, OPC power, natural gas Zafira, new Vectra and Signum models</p>

<p>In addition to the Antara GTC study, Opel presents IAA visitors four further world premieres: Opel expects the dynamic Astra TwinTop cabrio-coup&#233; to attract a lot of attention at the stand in Hall 8. A particular highlight of the four-seater, which goes on sale in the spring of 2006, is its three-part electro-hydraulic retractable steel roof. Thanks to the innovative roof kinematics very little space is taken up, allowing plenty of room for passengers and luggage.</p>

<p>The public will also get a first look at the OPC variants of the five-door Vectra and the Vectra station wagon. They feature a 255 hp, 2.8-liter V6 turbo gasoline engine and are available from November. The particular technological highlight of the Vectra OPC models is the newest-generation of the electronically controlled chassis with adaptive damping control, IDSPlus2.</p>

<p>The visually striking, as well as technically further developed new Vectra and Signum models will also be under the spotlight on the Opel stand in Frankfurt, as will a further premiere, the new Zafira 1.6 CNG with particularly economical and environmentally compatible natural gas propulsion.</p>

	<p>Chrysler Group has unveiled the Jeep&#174; Commander that will be coming to the UK market in right-hand drive during 2006.</p>

<p>The Jeep Commander, the first-ever Jeep to offer seven seats, will arrive in the UK in March 2006, expanding and strengthening the Jeep range.<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/new jeep.jpg" width="320" height="195" alt="Chrysler Jeep" align="right" /><br />
Commander is only 47 mm (1.8 in.) longer than the new Jeep Grand Cherokee, even though it is designed to accommodate three rows of seats, so it is as manoeuvrable and off-road capable as the Grand Cherokee. Jeep Commander shares the same state-of-the-art 4x4 systems, suspension and powertrains as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, including an independent front suspension and rack-and-pinion steering.</p>

<p>Simon Elliott added: "The Jeep Commander initiates the expansion of the Jeep vehicle line-up. Chrysler Group also revealed two new Jeep concept cars &#8211; the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot &#8211; at the show. These two compact SUVs focus on performance and fuel economy as well as nimble handling and a flexible interior, and help demonstrate where the Jeep brand may be heading at the other end of the range."<br />

KEY POINTS</p>

<p>* Sixth generation of Toyota&#8217;s second most successful global model<br />
* Unveiled this week at the Barcelona motor show<br />
* European and UK sales to start in October this year<br />
* Hilux showcases Toyota&#8217;s legendary quality, durability and reliability<br />
* Reinforced ladder frame chassis<br />
* All-new suspension for improved ride<br />
* Longer and wider than before, for extra load carrying and passenger space<br />
* Improved interior space and comfort<br />
* European models to be built to substantially higher technical and equipment specifications than versions currently offered by independent UK importers<br />
* More than 12 million units produced since 1967</p>

<p>SHORT STORY</p>

<p>The Toyota Hilux was famously the vehicle the Top Gear television team couldn&#8217;t destroy. Now an all-new model has broken cover, combining the legendary toughness of its predecessor with more room in the cabin, extra load-carrying capacity and better quality all-round.</p>

<p>The sixth generation of what is Toyota&#8217;s second best-selling global model (after Corolla) made its European debut this week at the Barcelona motor show. Sales in Europe and the UK will start in October.</p>

<p>The first generation Hilux was launched in Japan in 1967 and since then it has enjoyed continuous development and built a worldwide reputation for never-say-die toughness, reliability and power.</p>

<p>In creating the new Hilux, Toyota set an extremely ambitious goal: to develop a vehicle for business, leisure and adventure with all the strengths of its predecessors; that could deal with conditions from the world&#8217;s harshest environments.</p>

<p>In Europe new Hilux will contribute to Toyota&#8217;s strategy of increasing customer choice and building its market share, marketed at an affordable price alongside the SUV range of RAV4, Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser Amazon.</p>

<p>The new model has more interior space, improved driving characteristics, greater comfort and improved quality. It will be available in Single Cab and Double Cab body styles to cover a broad range of customer needs for both business and pleasure.</p>

<p>ROCK SOLID CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>The new Hilux is built on an all-new ladder frame chassis, giving it strong off-road capability. The chassis is unique to the model and uses a larger box section than the current Hilux with torsional stiffness increased by 45 per cent. This gives greater body control and reduces noise intrusion in the cabin. An impact brace between the front and first cross-members effectively absorbs impact forces and protects other chassis components from damage in the event of a collision.</p>

<p>The front suspension features independent double wishbones with coil springs which provide maximum travel and bump absorption and maintain good straight line stability and feel. Traditional leaf springs are used at the rear to maintain an excellent load carrying capacity and avoid intrusion into the flat bed.</p>

<p>Major body panels are made of high-tensile sheet steel which increases strength, durability and crash protection. An anti-chipping coating has been added to exposed areas such as the door sills and underbody to protect against corrosion.</p>

<p>Aerodynamic styling has helped improve fuel consumption and reduce noise levels with elements such as an engine undercover and wind deflectors.</p>

<p>At the time of launch the new Hilux will be offered with Toyota&#8217;s 102bhp 2.5-litre D-4D diesel engine with second-generation common rail injection and swirl control system. The engine&#8217;s power and maximum 260Nm of torque (200Nm on two-wheel drive models) make it a flexible performer for both work and leisure driving.</p>

<p>The five-speed manual transmission has been made smoother and easier to use, with a better gear change feel. The powertrain line up will be expanded in the future starting with an intercooled version of the 2.5 D-4D next year.</p>

<p>The transfer gearbox enables four-wheel drive and a rear axle limited slip differential is fitted as standard to give improved traction in slippery conditions. Selected grades will also offer a differential lock.</p>

<p>MORE SPACE, MORE PRESENCE</p>

<p>The new Hilux has great visual impact, not least as it is considerably larger than the model it replaces. Its great road presence reflects its heritage as a working vehicle in some of the toughest environments around the world.</p>

<p>Double Cab and Single Cab with both two and four-wheel drive transmissions will be available. Both models offer more space, particularly in the cabin where class-leading quality and comfort have been achieved.</p>

<p>The new Hilux is 5,130mm long, making Single and Double Cab versions 340mm longer than the current model. It is also considerably wider (+60mm Single Cab, +45mm Double Cab), but is the same height as before. Most of the additional length is in the wheelbase, extended to 3,085mm. This allows for greater interior space and a more comfortable ride for passengers.</p>

<p>The load deck is also bigger. The vertical sides allow for width to increase by 50mm (55mm in Single Cab). It&#8217;s longer, too: up by 155mm in Single Cab and 165mm in Double Cab. Total load lengths are now 2,315mm for the Single Cab and 1,520mm for the Double Cab.</p>

<p>In line with the actual and perceived quality characteristics for which Toyota passenger cars are renowned, the new Hilux benefits from tighter panel fit and clearances. The instrument panel fit now compares to that on the Toyota Avensis, while door clearance on all frames has been reduced to between 4.5 and 5mm.</p>

<p>Quality materials are used for the full interior trim, doorsills are fitted with scuff plates and the interior has an impact-absorbing headlining.</p>

<p>The Double Cab will comfortably accommodate five people with improved seat design longer cushions, extra slide and recline adjustment and adjustable headrests in the rear. The rear seat can also be folded up to increase load space. Storage space is improved with extra cupholders, larger door bins, centre cubby holes and larger centre console box.</p>

Sources tell the Spies that the wicked cool Toyota FJ40 Land Cruiser concept will be officialy announced at the Chicago auto show.<br /><br />What the others haven't told you that the Spies have found out, is that they will offer a hybrid version as well.<br /><br />Photos are pics of the 2003 concept...<br />
<img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/fjcruiser2.jpg" width="576" height="432" alt="Toyota FJ40 Land Cruiser" align="left" /><br />
We first reported on it during our 2003 Detroit auto show coverage and picked it as our FAVORITE concept.<br /><br />We urge you to run down to your Toyota dealer a put a deposit down on one because this will be one HOT SUV/Crossover!<br /><br />Check out the info from the concept in 2003...we'll see how close the production model comes to it.<br /><br />From our 2003 Detroit auto show issue:<br /><br />Toyota Unveils FJ Cruiser Concept at North American International Auto Show<br /><br />Toyota unveiled the FJ Cruiser concept sport utility vehicle (SUV) at a press conference at the 2003 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS).<br /><br />The FJ Cruiser concept was initiated and developed jointly by Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A., Inc., and Calty Design Research, Toyota's North American design center in Newport Beach, Calif. The FJ Cruiser was developed as a basic, capable and affordable off-roader aimed to explore new possibilities for a next-generation SUV aimed specifically at young buyers with active outdoor lifestyles.<br /><br />"The FJ Cruiser is a thoroughly modern concept vehicle chiseled from nearly a half-century tradition of rugged performance provided by the legendary FJ 40, the original 4Runner and 4x4 compact pickups," said Jim Press, executive vice president and COO for Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A., Inc. "The FJ Cruiser concept effectively connects two growing markets in the United States&#8230;the light truck segment and the emerging youth market."<br /><br />"The FJ Cruiser takes on an authentic functional form, yet adopts several styling cues from the original FJ," said Jin Kim, the FJ Cruiser&#8217;s 25-year-old exterior designer. "Some of these cues are notable on the front end by its wide and narrow grille, round headlights, and offset combination lamps. Additional inspiration can be found through its upright windshield and two-tone cap roof. Traits are also noticeable in the rear with wrapping rear corner windows. The modern shape of the FJ Cruiser is woven into a compact package. Its proportionately long wheelbase and wide track produce enhanced stability and a powerful stance."<br /><br />Utility features include spotlights on both outside mirrors, an asymmetrical front spotlight, and a front-end towing winch. The rear glass panel is a two-piece unit that retracts into the roof and the rear hatch for easy access to the rear cargo area. Easy rear passenger entry into the two-door SUV is achieved with rear access doors.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/fjcruiser3.jpg" width="576" height="432" alt="Toyota FJ40 Land Cruiser" align="right" /><br />
Power is supplied by a 3.4-liter V6 engine equipped with a Toyota Racing Development (TRD) supercharger that creates 250-horsepower. The engine is paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel-drive with low range. The FJ Cruiser rides on a modified Tacoma pickup platform and is equipped with rear coil-over long travel suspension, 20-inch wheels and 33-inch tires, and a TRD cat-back exhaust.<br /><br />Calty designer William Chergosky extended the rugged and straightforward theme to the interior. "The cabin is designed specifically for basic functionality and flexible utility," said Chergosky.<br /><br />"The structural beam instrument panel has a sophisticated, handcrafted appearance. The faceplate with round inset instrumentation communicates precision and ruggedness. The steering wheel and center-mounted shifter, and attached look door panels feature tool-like simplicity with an industrial feel. A portable remote GPS is removable for wilderness hiking."<br /><br />All front and rear seats fold completely flat creating ample cargo space and maximum usability. With no gaps and a durable floor covering, the FJ Cruiser can be converted into a utility deck large enough for two people in their sleeping bags.<br /><br />"It is important for Toyota to raise the emotional pulse of the emerging youth market," said Press. "The FJ Cruiser is a thoughtful approach to versatility that allows the customer to decide how the vehicle fits into their active lifestyles."<br /><br />TOYOTA FJ CRUISER CONCEPT SPECIFICATIONS<br /><br />Millimeters Inches<br />Wheelbase 2700 106.3<br />Overall Length 4340 170.9<br />Overall Height 1828 72.0<br />Overall Width 1920 75.6<br /><br />Tires&#8230;33 X 12.50 R20 inches</p>

	<div class="storyContent">
	<p>Detroit, Michigan, 9 January 2005 &#8211; Just 12 months after revealing the Range Stormer concept car at the NAIAS in 2004, Land Rover is back this year with a remarkable and updated product range, comprising three new products not seen before at Detroit.</p>

<p>All new on the stand, and probably the most eagerly awaited of the Land Rover products at the 2005 NAIAS, is the Range Rover Sport. Inspired by the Range Stormer concept car, the Range Rover Sport sees Land Rover entering the performance segment of the SUV market for the first time with its very own 'Sports Tourer'.</p>

<p>Also new on the Land Rover NAIAS stand is the Range Rover for 2006, which is the first significant update to the award-winning Range Rover since its introduction in March 2002. The Range Rover for 2006 receives new petrol powertrain technology, refinement enhancements, improvements to its NVH characteristics and some refreshed exterior styling. In addition and also new since the company's last visit to Detroit is the international award-winning Land Rover Discovery 3, on-sale since November 2004 and currently sold out well into 2005.</p>

<p>Speaking from Detroit, Land Rover's managing director, Matthew Taylor, said: "What an incredible 12 months this has been. Last year, at this very venue, we promised exciting new models. Now we have three new production vehicles to show. Such is the pace of change at Land Rover."</p>

<p>He added: "The Range Rover Sport, we believe, will appeal to customers who want the on-road dynamics and refinement of luxury sedans, but who also want the capability of a Land Rover. We see it as a less frenetic, more refined alternative to existing performance SUVs. It is ideal for fast, comfortable, long-distance driving and practical enough for everyday use. Yet it is also exceptional off-road, offering better all-terrain ability than any competitor and the broadest range of capability in its class."</p>

<p>Land Rover dealerships around the world opened the order books for the Range Rover Sport on 26 November 2004, and thousands of confirmed orders have already been made, without any customers actually seeing the vehicle in the metal &#8211; until now in Detroit.</p>

<p>The Land Rover Discovery 3 is already on sale around the world and the Range Rover for 2006 and the Range Rover Sport will follow in mid-2005.</p>

	<p>The Chrystler Group today took the automotive press by storm with the introduction of a new and unexpected concept vehicle, the Jeep Hurricane. <img src="http://www.4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/jeephurrican.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="Jeep Hurricane" align="left" /><br />
With two 5.7-liter 335-HP V-8 engines - HEMI squared - the Hurricane travels from a stand-still zero MPH to 60 MPH in less than five seconds, said Chrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche. <br />The concept, which bows here at the North American International Auto Show, features split solid axles, with a V-8 at each end of the truck. It has a mechanically controlled four-wheel torque distribution system. <br />Chrysler said the split solid axle design affects the rotation direction of each propshaft, applying a downward force to each wheel. <br />Hurricane has the unusual ability to spin on its axis -- Chrysler calls it a "turntable feature." It also has four-wheel steering to help out if it gets "between a rock and a hard place," Zetsche said. <br />With 370 lb.-ft. of torque per engine, the Hurricane can run in four-, eight- or 16-cylinder mode. <br />It has a carbon fiber chassis and body and a 14.6-inch ground clearance for extreme offroad activities. Its 20-inch wheels have, with tires, a 37-inch diameter. <br />Chrysler opened its first press preview today with a gray-green Jeep Gladiator, an extended-cab pickup with the familiar Jeep vertical grille and offroad capabilities. The regular pickup bed is 5 ft. 8 inches; it can extend into the cab to an overall length of 6 ft. 8 inches; if the tailgate is also dropped, the maximum cargo length is 8 feet ll inches. <br />A rear-hinged door behind the front passenger door has a 180-degree opening. The concept has special storage compartments, a spare tire mounted outside and behind the driver's door and an expandable truck bed space. <br />Gladiator is powered by a 2.8-liter, four-cylinder turbo diesel engine that cranks out 295 lb-ft of torque and 163 HP. <br />Chrysler design chief Trevor also introduced the two-seater Firepower with a 6.1-liter HEMI V-8 under the hood. It is based on a (Dodge) Viper platform, and travels from zero to 60 MPH in under 4.5 seconds.</p>

<p>* New seven seater Pathfinder SUV unveiled for Europe</p>

<p>* First showing of European-spec Murano cross-over powered by the 350Z&#8217;s V6 engine</p>

<p>* Dramatically revised Patrol 4x4</p>

<p>* Latest X-TRAIL Fuel Cell Vehicle gets first European showing</p>

<p>* Special version of the Navara in association with Hobie Cat, the leading manufacturer of catamaran sailing boats</p>

<p>At the 2004 Paris Motor Show, Nissan will be displaying many new and recently revised 4x4s which will underline the company&#8217;s aggressive ambitions in Europe, as well as its desire to change consumers&#8217; perception of Nissan.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Nissan press conference will take place at 1315 on 23 September. Nissan&#8217;s stand will be located in Hall One where, in addition to the following vehicles, visitors can also get their first look at the European specification 350Z Roadster.</p>

<p>Pathfinder</p>

<p>Due to go on sale in March 2005, the Pathfinder sports utility vehicle is a new addition to Nissan&#8217;s growing four-wheel drive line up inspired by the Dunehawk concept car which was displayed at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003.</p>

<p>The interior provides three rows of seats, with the second and third rows folding flat to create a huge load area. Thanks to the versatility of the interior, a total of 64 different seating configurations is possible. Even with the third row of seats in place, there is class-leading luggage space. For added convenience, the rear glass hatch opens for easy access to the rear luggage area in tight spaces.</p>

<p>Power comes from Nissan&#8217;s new highly efficient 2.5-litre &#8216;YD&#8217; series four-cylinder turbo diesel engine. It features second-generation common rail technology for lower emissions and a new balancer system for greater refinement. It gives category-leading power and torque outputs which out-perform those of larger engines, while also providing outstanding economy figures.</p>

<p>Although a 4x4, the Pathfinder is equipped with independent double-wishbone suspension all-round which gives a car-like on-road dynamic performance. However, its advanced electronically controlled ALL MODE 4x4 transmission &#8211; an enhanced version of that which is fitted to the X-TRAIL &#8211; endows it with a high level of capability off-road.</p>

<p>The ALL-MODE transmission allows drivers to choose effortlessly between four different settings with the twist of a selector switch, giving the control of a serious 4x4, but without the need to operate a separate gear lever.</p>

<p>Equipment and technology levels are high. Nissan will offer a rear-view parking camera &#8211; as pioneered on Primera &#8211; and the Intelligent Key system which allows the doors to be unlocked and the engine started without having to insert the key into a lock.</p>

<p>Additionally xenon headlamps, a premium audio system, satellite navigation with Traffic Message Channel (TMC) and voice recognition, leather upholstery, dual zone climate control in the front and air conditioning in the rear are all available.</p>

<p>Murano</p>

<p>The European version of the Murano will be on display in Paris &#8211; its European debut. An eye-catching cross-over with the elevation of a 4x4, but the lines of a sports car, the Murano will provide comfort and performance for the discerning car-buyer.</p>

<p>Powered by an adapted version of the award-winning 3.5-litre VQ V6 engine found in the 350Z Coupe and Roadster, the Murano has proved to be a huge hit in North America where it has been on sale for more than a year.</p>

<p>More than 1,600 changes have been made to the US specification Murano to ensure it is ideally suited to the demanding European market.</p>

<p>Coupled to the engine is a unique offering in the Murano&#8217;s segment of the market &#8211; a Continuously Variable Transmission which features a six speed manual mode. Power is transmitted to the road via Nissan&#8217;s electronically controlled ALL MODE switchable 4x4 system.</p>

<p>There will be just one version of Murano on sale in Europe and the level of standard equipment is very high. All Muranos will feature satellite navigation with Traffic Message Channel (TMC) providing real-time traffic updates, a colour rear-view parking camera, a high-end Bose sound system, bi-xenon headlamps and leather interior.</p>

<p>The Murano will go on sale early in 2005 across Europe, while prices and specifications will be announced at the Paris Motor Show, when the order book will open.</p>

<p>Patrol</p>

<p>The iconic Patrol has just benefited from a wide range of improvements. With an extensive list of exterior modifications, as well as an upgraded interior, the Patrol continues to set the standard in the authentic 4x4 segment.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a bold new &#8216;face&#8217;, a new-look rear end and a new integrated side step, while revisions to the lusty 3.0-litre turbo diesel engine give more power and more torque. Additionally, the &#8216;GR&#8217; moniker will be dropped from the name.</p>

<p>But perhaps the biggest changes can be found inside the vehicle. Although the Nissan Patrol remains a tough off-road vehicle at heart, Nissan believes there is no reason why users should not enjoy a little extra luxury while they work. As a result, the new Patrol has an all-new interior featuring better quality materials, greater comfort and more equipment.</p>

<p>X-TRAIL Fuel Cell Vehicle</p>

<p>Nissan is showing its 2003 Fuel Cell Vehicle which has significantly improved speed and range compared with the 2002 FCV which was shown at Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003.</p>

<p>Such is the progress that has been made with fuel cell technology, leasing of the 2003 FCV began in Japan earlier this year.</p>

<p>Pickup</p>

<p>Nissan has entered into a partnership with Hobie Cat, the leading manufacturer of catamaran sailing boats and in recognition a new Special Version of the Pickup model has been developed.</p>

<p>Reflecting the busy and active leisure-orientated lifestyles of sailors everywhere, the Pickup Hobie Cat has some special features which will enable it to support its owners in all of their activities, no matter how challenging.</p>

<p>The newly revised Primera, as well as the X-TRAIL will also be on display in Paris.</p>

	<p>The nations favourite battered pick up, a red Toyota Hilux made famous by BBC&#8217;s Top Gear, makes an appearance at The Sunday Times Motor Show Live. The pick up, which looks an absolute wreck apparently still starts but won&#8217;t be moving from its static display at the show.<br /><br />The heroic vehicle, which has been chained to the seabed and immersed by the tide and placed on top of a tower block that was demolished with explosives, astounded Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear audiences when it simply refused to die.<br /><br />The pick up can seen in all its wrecked glory at the Top Gear stand through out the show.</p>

	<p>Sunday Times Motor Show Live, Birmingham, 25 May 2004 - Making its debut at Land Rover's home show is the proposed Freelander rally limited edition (LE) that could go on sale in the UK from September 2004, depending on public reaction and interest in the vehicle.<br /><br />The Freelander LE concept boasts Fiji Blue metallic paint, sports leather interior, 18" white alloy sports wheels, lowered and tuned suspension together with blue stitching on the leather steering wheel and gear knob. The concept also features a glass twin panel roof for the 3-door or electric tilt/slide sunroof for the 5-door.<br /><br />The concept was inspired by the reconnaissance vehicles used by Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz during the 2001 World Rally Championship, and evolved when Land Rover and M-Sport Ltd teamed up to introduce these vehicles at the Pirelli British Rally Championship (PBRC) as a spectator and safety control vehicle.<br /><br />The Freelander starred at each of the 2003 Pirelli British Rally Championship events with ex-Scottish rally champion David Gillanders at the wheel. During a trial session at Land Rover's proving ground in Warwickshire, David Gillanders said: "This is the most capable Freelander in the world. It can take everything thrown at it and more".<br /><br />Land Rover UK managing director, Phil Popham said: "The popularity of the Freelander rally vehicles at various events during the past twelve months convinced us to build a one-off LE to gauge public reaction. That's what we have done for Birmingham and we look forward to hearing what visitors to the show think of it."</p>

		Discovery 3  V6 Diesel makes its Debut at Motorshow		&nbsp;-&nbsp;

<p>Sunday Times Motor Show Live, Birmingham, 25 May 2004 &#8211; Making its world debut at The Sunday Times Motor Show Live at Birmingham is the powerful and refined Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6. Equipped with an advanced common-rail 2.7-litre power unit, the Land Rover Discovery 3 TDV6 is set to redefine a market that Land Rover has made its own.<br />
<img src="http://4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/discov6d.jpg" width="200" height="137" alt="Landrover Discovery V6 Diesel" align="right" /><br />
Matthew Taylor, Land Rover's managing director says of the new vehicle: &#8216;The all-new Land Rover Discovery 3 is the purest expression of 21st Century Land Rover. It is modern, boldly designed, packed with high technology and has the broadest breadth of capability in its class. Now with the addition of this new engine, that has already earned critical acclaim in its Jaguar form, the new Discovery 3 TDV6 will offer outstanding power, responsiveness and refinement to our customers when it goes on sale later this year.&#8217;<br /><br />Anticipated to be the major seller both in the UK and in Europe the 2.7-litre, V6, direct-injection, turbocharged diesel engine develops 140 kW (190bhp) of power. This is coupled with an impressive 440 Nm (325 lb-ft) of torque at less than 1,900 rpm endowing the Discovery 3 TDV6 with excellent drivability. The 24-valve engine features the latest technology including a high-pressure common-rail fuel supply, fast-acting electronically-controlled injectors and a turbocharger with variable nozzle control.<br /><br />The TDV6 engine is extensively developed to meet the unique demands of Land Rover. Its oil sump has pick up points designed to operate at extreme angles and the front crank oil seal is modified to guard against ingress from water, mud or slurry during wading or other off-road driving conditions. Also unique to its Land Rover application, the TDV6 turbo-diesel has an aluminium ladder frame at the bottom of the crankcase to improve rigidity.<br /><br />The all-aluminium, 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine provides a powerful alternative. Developing 220 kW (295 bhp) of power and 425 Nm (314 lb-ft) of torque, this power unit features Variable Camshaft Timing that means the engine responds instantly to driving demands. Maximum fuel efficiency is provided by multi-hole fuel injectors and a 32-valve layout.<br /><br />Power is fed through a manual or automatic ZF six-speed gearbox on the new diesel model. The automatic unit is standard for the V8 petrol engine. A two-speed transfer box shares the drive between the front and rear axles and features an electrically-controlled locking differential. A similar unit is optional in the rear differential for maximum off-road traction.<br /><br />The Discovery 3 is based on Land Rover&#8217;s innovative Integrated Body-Frame&#8482; structure, which allows Land Rover to deliver all the comfort, refinement and on-road poise of a monocoque, while continuing to set new standards in off-road performance.<br /><br />All-round independent suspension riding on variable-height air springs results in precise road manners and supple confidence off-road. The braking system features large disc brakes all-round to provide maximum stopping power, with the TDV6 boasting 317 and 325 mm discs on the front and rear respectively and the V8 337 and 350 mm. The Discovery 3 has a comprehensive array of slip control systems including dynamic stability control, electronic traction control and the award-winning hill descent control to cope with any situation on- or off-road.<br /><br />Harnessing the performance of the Discovery 3 to cope with a variety of conditions is made simple with the sophistication offered by the new Terrain Response system, which makes its production debut in the Discovery 3, following its preview in the Range Stormer concept vehicle.<br /><br />Using only a single chunky control, the driver simply dials in the appropriate surface confronting the vehicle, choosing from a general programme for normal driving, a special programme for slippery conditions (dubbed &#8216;grass/gravel/snow&#8217;), and three covering off-road surfaces &#8211; mud/ruts, sand and rock crawl. Terrain Response automatically tunes the vehicle&#8217;s systems including engine and gearbox response, electronic slip control systems sensitivity and even ride height to optimise driveability and comfort as well as maximising traction.<br /><br />The interior features the iconic spaciousness typical of the Discovery nameplate. The driver enjoys Land Rover's traditional 'command' seating position, while all the rear passengers get stadium seating &#8211; progressively higher than the seats in front &#8211; offering a clearer view. The optional third row of seats serve up great comfort, and are big enough to accommodate 95th percentile adults. This cleverly designed seating, fit for seven adults, further improves the Discovery 3's outstanding versatility, including fold-flat rear seats in both second and third rows, to give huge load-carrying ability.<br /><br />Careful choice of materials for the internal trim enhances the airy practicality of the Discovery 3 and the travelling experience is improved by the latest in-car &#8216;infotainment&#8217; system options that include state-of-the-art on- and off-road navigation and a harman/kardon &#8216;Logic 7&#8217; digital surround sound hi-fi system, with control being through a widescreen LCD display with voice recognition.<br /><br />Land Rover&#8217;s managing director, Matthew Taylor, says of the Discovery 3: &#8216;It&#8217;s a true Land Rover, benefiting from a clarity of purpose and conviction that&#8217;s evident from its clean design, versatility and outstanding dynamic characteristics. Like all of the new Land Rovers, it&#8217;s great to drive on-road as well as being best-in-class off-road. The Discovery 3 will reinforce Land Rover&#8217;s command of a market sector that it created with the original Discovery. It&#8217;s a bold and distinctive design that&#8217;s coupled with innovative features and a range of powerful engines to provide an unforgettable driving experience whether on- or off-road.&#8217;</p>

Hyundai is all set to storm the Sunday Times Motor Show Live, taking place at the Birmingham NEC from 27 May to 6 June 2004, with three UK debuts.<br /><br />Not only will the show see the UK debut of the company&#8217;s eagerly awaited new small-SUV, the Tucson, but two popular future prototypes will be on show together for the first time.<br /><br />The Tucson (pronounced Too-son), is set to go on sale in the UK from the autumn, and is Hyundai&#8217;s new entry level point into the 4x4 market, competing with the likes of the Toyota RAV-4 and Land Rover Freelander. The Tucson features a &#8216;torque-on-demand&#8217; four-wheel drive system, where the vehicle engine system detects when traction is lost and switches the car from front-wheel drive into four-wheel drive.<br /><br />Hyundai will also be taking part in the Motor Show 4x4 Experience, where visitors can be driven around a challenging off-road course in a Santa Fe or Terracan.<br /><br />The other Hyundai models at the show will include the Santa Fe and Terracan.<br /><br />The Hyundai range at the show come with the UK&#8217;s only five year warranty &#8211; which is transferable between owners and has no mileage limit.<br /><br />Hyundai can be found in Hall 7, at Stand 7-110.</p>

	<p>Gaydon, Warwickshire, 7 April 2004 &#8211; The all-new Discovery 3 makes its world debut today at the 2004 New York Auto Show, marking the birth of a new generation of vehicle that defined its sector following a 1989 launch.<br />
Since then, the Discovery has gone on to sell over 700,000 in the 142 markets around the world in which it is sold. The UK is one of these 142 markets, and figures released today confirm that the first quarter of 2004 has been the most successful in Land Rover UK's history, with 15,181 vehicles sold, beating the previous year's first quarter record by more than 5%.</p>

<p>In the first three months of the year, 7,446 Freelanders have been sold, which is an increase of over 200 vehicles on the same period in 2003, largely due to the improvements made for the 2004 model year. Sales of the Range Rover hit 2,128, beating last year's figure by 3%, whilst sales of the Defender remained reasonably static at 1,762, some 68 vehicles less than were sold quarter of 2003.</p>

<p>Again however, it is the Discovery which appears to be attracting the most attention, with sales for the quarter increasing by a remarkable 15.9%, with 3,845 units sold.</p>

<p>Speaking from the New York Auto Show, Land Rover UK managing director, Phil Popham said: "This is a great day in the history of the Land Rover Discovery, with the all-new Discovery 3 making a real splash here in New York, and the current range of Discovery 'Definitive Editions' breaking sales records back home in the UK."</p>

<p>The range of Discovery 'Definitive Editions' are on sale now at Land Rover dealerships throughout the UK, starting at &#163;24,995 with the 'Pursuit' model.</p>

	<p><img src="http://4x4uk.org/b2evolution/media/Range_Stormer_image.jpg" width="299" height="199" alt="Range Stormer" align="left" />Detroit, Mich., USA, 5 January 2004 - Land Rover makes history today at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, by unveiling its first ever concept show car, the Range Stormer.<br />
The Range Stormer is a high performance, sports tourer SUV concept car, which showcases a future design direction for Land Rover. It also previews a new production model, one that will enter a fresh market segment for the company and will be an additional model line in the Land Rover portfolio.<br />
Commenting on the new concept, Land Rover's managing director Matthew Taylor, said: "The supercharged V8 Range Stormer gives a taste of our forthcoming new entrant in the booming high performance SUV segment. The production vehicle that follows will share many of its styling and technical innovations. It is very much conceived to be an on-road, high performance machine, as well as class-leading off-road like all Land Rovers."<br />
Geoff Upex, design director at Land Rover, added: "The challenge was to translate fundamental Land Rover design values into a concept for a high performance machine that looks powerful, muscular and edgy. We certainly want to challenge established views of our vehicles, but the Range Stormer is very clearly an authentic Land Rover."<br />
Future technologies previewed with the concept include an all-new platform that will be the basis for future full-size Land Rover models. This advanced, integrated platform, unique to Land Rover, will provide the underpinnings for the production vehicle inspired by the Range Stormer.<br />
Another major innovation showcased is Terrain Response. This smart and simple-to-use new Land Rover technology delivers the best possible on- and off-road composure and control by optimising the entire vehicle set-up.<br />
The driver simply selects the appropriate Terrain Response setting from the six available and the suspension, powertrain, throttle response and traction control come together to do the rest, based on a choice ranging from 'dynamic' for high speed work to 'deep ruts' for extreme off-roading.<br />
Matthew Taylor concluded: "You'll be seeing an increasing amount of innovative technology in our future vehicles. But technology that makes the driver's task simpler not more complicated, such as Terrain Response. You select the terrain. The car then helps you conquer it."<br />
The Range Stormer was completed with the support of suppliers Alcoa (22" forged alloy wheels), Hella (interior and exterior lights) and Goodyear (custom made tyres).</p>
