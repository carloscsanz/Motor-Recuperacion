The day&rsquo;s sessions will bring together some of the brightest stars from industry who are addressing practical information retrieval problems. The Industry Track aims to address two constituencies: it gives researchers an opportunity to learn about the problems most relevant to industry practitioners, and offers practitioners an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the field in which they are working.</p>
<p>The agenda consists of the following speakers and panelists invited by the Industry Track program committee and the <a href="/about/organizers">SIGIR 2009 Organizing Committee</a>.</p>
<p>These presentations will occur in parallel with the technical program of the day and attendees may move between the technical tracks and the industry track at will. That is, anyone registered for the full conference will be able to attend Industry Track presentations. Also, anyone opting for the special Wednesday-only registration will be invited to attend any technical presentations on that day. (Registration details are not yet available.)</p>

<dt>&quot;The Searchable Nature of Acts in Networked Publics&quot;</dt>
<dd><img hspace="2" align="right" alt="Picture of danah boyd" src="http://sigir2009.org/image/view/58/mediumthumb" />Mediated public spaces that connect people through networked technologies - &quot;networked publics&quot; - have properties that are quite different from their physical equivalent. The content produced in networked publics is typically persistent, replicable, searchable, and accessible to a much different scale of audience. Each of these properties alters the dynamics of everyday interactions that take place in these environments. In this talk, I will explore what it means that sociality is fundamentally searchable and how people navigate these spaces with this property in mind.</dd>

<dt>&quot;Ad Retrieval &ndash; A New Frontier of Information Retrieval&quot;</dt>
<dd><img hspace="2" align="right" alt="Picture of Vanja Josifovski" src="http://sigir2009.org/image/view/55/mediumthumb" />The field of Information Retrieval has produced some of the most impactful Computer Science research: from the early beginning of exploring how to search articles and books in libraries, to the current focus on searching the World Wide Web. In this talk, I will make the case for Ad Retrieval as a new distinct sub-discipline of Information Retrieval focusing on retrieving online advertisements. Online advertising affects virtually every web user and has grown into a $20 billon industry. As with the Web corpus, the structure of the online ads is substantially different than any other previously studied corpus. The queries used in selecting online ads can also substantially differ from the commonly explored short textual queries, as for example when selecting advertisements for a given web page or a context of a user. These differences require reexamination of many conclusions of traditional IR, as document analysis, query expansion, scoring and length normalization, and performance evaluation. The talk will outline some of the main challenges of Ad Retrieval and discuss how to engage the SIGIR community in the exploration of this new frontier of Information Retrieval.</dd>

<dt>&quot;Alexandria 2.0: Search Innovations Keep Libraries Relevant in an Online World&quot;</dt>
<dd>The costs of searching very large collections of meta-data, abstracts, and full-text content have been reduced dramatically for OCLC and the library community through a series of searching innovations that began in 2006 and are continuing through today. This huge reduction has allowed the community to make more than a billion items in over 70,000 libraries around the world freely discoverable on the web at <a href="http://www.worldcat.org" title="http://www.worldcat.org">http://www.worldcat.org</a>, and establish a collective web presence that extends the relevance of the library beyond the traditional bricks-and-mortar model.</dd>
<dd><img hspace="2" align="right" alt="Picture of Tip House" src="http://sigir2009.org/image/view/57/mediumthumb" />Some of the innovations making this possible include the implementation of grid and autonomic computing, the complete elimination of disc access, the use of deterministic query optimization, and content-based relevance ranking algorithms. Current work on automated indexing and categorization, semantic and topological searching, and inclusion of relational and XML/RDF capabilities along with full text capabilities into a single integrated engine will continue to enable a relevant presence in the online world for the library community well into the future. </dd>
