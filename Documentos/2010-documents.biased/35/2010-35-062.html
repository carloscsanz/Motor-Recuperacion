<p><strong>Terrible</strong><br />I bought this dock to use with my new Dell Studio 1555. I planned to take advantage of display link technology and be able to run a 2nd monitor through the dock, as well as stream line my other USB devices to just one connection. Since reviews of this dock were mixed, I was a little wary of how it would function but figured it was worth a shot. For reference, I am running Windows 7 professional 64-bit on a dual core p8700 computer with 4gb of ram. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this dock just doesn&#8217;t cut it. It immediately recognized all of my USB devices and installed drivers for them, and then launched the displaylink installer which crashed half way through. I restarted the installer manually, and this time installation completed successfully. However the secondary monitor never turned on. I rebooted, and this time the monitor did come on, but only at 1024&#215;768 resolution. The default for my monitor is 1920&#215;1080 so that was obviously not satisfactory. I did quite a lot of messing around with both Catalyst Control Center (for my AMD graphics card) as well as with Window&#8217;s built in display manager, but could never get the resolution correct no matter what I tried. I went to Kensington&#8217;s web-page hoping to find some solutions, but their page has nothing at all useful for this dock. They did have a newer driver package (Nov. 2009), so I downloaded that hoping it would fix the resolution problem. After installing it and rebooting, the secondary monitor stopped working altogether! </p>
<p>I tried a variety of things to trouble shoot the non-working 2nd monitor, but nothing fixed the problem. I went to the displaylink webpage hoping they had support or a potential fix, but again, nothing. I then tried plugging the monitor directly into my computer using an HDMI cable and was able to get it to display immediately at full resolution. The Kensington dock couldn&#8217;t get it a signal at all, even after multiple restarts of both my computer and the dock (in different orders hoping that would make a difference&#8211;it didn&#8217;t). </p>
<p>Long story short, this dock does support all the USB devices I needed to connect, but so does my much cheaper powered 8-way USB hub. The main reason I wanted this was to streamline the number of things I need to plug into my computer when I want to use it at my work station. I&#8217;ve just gone back to the hub, knowing that I&#8217;ll also need to plug in an HDMI cable and Ethernet cable, which really isn&#8217;t that big of a deal since I cable-banded them together so they&#8217;re all ready to go when I sit down. </p>
<p>I wasted about 6 hours of my life trying to get this dock to work. Your mileage may vary with different hardware/OS but I was seriously not impressed with this device nor the poorly laid out (and slow I might add) webpages of Kensington and Displaylink. I&#8217;m used to robust support sites from the likes of Asus, Crucial, etc., with real information and forums for solving problems. Kensington and Displaylink support pages are laughable, so if you do have an issue outside their 8 arbitrary FAQs, good luck getting your problem fixed. </p>
<p>I would not waste your money on this dock unless you are willing to spend a lot of time to MAYBE get it to work correctly. Right now it doesn&#8217;t appear that there are any really good docks out there, so I&#8217;ll probably just skip using one altogether until something much improved comes out (along the lines of the Harmony remote which actually DOES what it is supposed to and makes your life simpler!). </p>
<p>1/5 Stars. An overpriced USB hub. </p>
<p><strong>Works with Windows 7 (32 / 64bit)</strong><br />Just received the dock so i can share my big screen Sony KDL-52Z5100 and 24Inch monitor with the Dell Lat E6500 and HP HDX-16t. the dock works right of the bat after plugging in usb to laptop within 30 seconds it notified ithe display driver was being installed but it failed because Win 7 was not supported but and error message to visit [...] for latest driver (new driver dated Nov 25 2009) installed the driver rebooted laptop and it works. connected the dock to Tv using pc generic 15 ft cable (from [...]) and i can have extended display of any combination. to test the any lag in video display thru dock i played Two &#038; Half men from cbs.com in HD works fine on the 52 inch tv. tho i think the color could be better may be the pc link was problem but the point is regular 24 inch monitor showed nothing different for regular office work and web surfing the color difference should not matter. overall good product and now i can dock dell latitude, HP Hdx and Dell Studio to same monitor</p>
<p><strong>No Directions</strong><br />No.1 You can just say there is no direction. There is a little piece of paper with a couple of pictures and then you just figure it out from there.</p>
<p>No.2 I run normal PC&#8217;s, but I use Apple 40&#8243; monitors. (Won&#8217;t work)</p>
<p>No.3. IT says NO to Windows 7. A window pops up and said will not work with this operating system.</p>
<p>I was a week late on my return&#8230;..but if Amazon will give me back 1 dollar it will be twice as much as it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect fit</strong><br />Plug and play was great, works well and auto update of software is a great feature. Kensington has done a great job putting everything you need in one unit. Great choice and very happy with my purchase. </p>
<p><strong>Complete Waste of Money</strong><br />I bought this to try to declutter my workspace area and have an easy way to connect and disconnect my laptop. However, it is so not up to the job.</p>
<p>First, the driver for my graphics chip does not recognize my second monitor when it is run through the docking station. I can still get a picture on my second monitor and I can make resolution adjustments through Windows, but Windows won&#8217;t allow me to make the proper resolution adjustment. Further, video is choppy on the second monitor when run through the dock. Therefore, I can only watch video and adjust the second monitor&#8217;s resolution properly when the monitor is hooked directly up to my computer, makes running second monitor through docking station mostly useless. Tech support&#8217;s solution is to tell me to plug the monitor directly into the computer. </p>
<p>Also, whenever I unplug the computer from the docking station and then plug it back in when I&#8217;m done travelling with the laptop, it completely wipes out the second display capabilities of the docking station. At that point, I have to unplug the docking station from it&#8217;s power source and plug it back in. Once I do that, the second display works again (w/o the correct resolution) but I lose the mouse function. I also lose the mouse function everytime I restart the computer. To get it working again, I have to plug and unplug the mouse dongle in several times. Tech support&#8217;s solution is to plug the mouse dongle directly into the computer. </p>
<p>My Hauppage TV card does not play nicely with docking stations, including this one. So, my only solution is to plug the TV card directly into my computer. So, essentially, almost everything I want to run through the docking station has to be plugged into the computer anyway. It&#8217;s mostly worthless. At this point, the only meaningful function of the docking station is to charge and USB connect things like my cell phone, mp3 player and external harddrive. But I already have a $13 USB Hub from Walmart that can do that just fine. I should have saved my money. </p>
<p>Update: Because my laptop is an HP DV4 series, I replaced this Kensington with HP&#8217;s, xb4 Docking Station. Everything worked great, right out of the box, even the TV card. So, I think the technology for the universal docking station just isn&#8217;t there yet. </p>
