                                        <p>The David Horowitz Freedom Center is calling upon all supporters of freedom of speech and of Israel to join in its protest against Facebook, the Internet social networking site.  Facebook has allowed a group of hackers who openly support the terrorist group Hizballah to take over and destroy what was once the largest pro-Israel site on Facebook. In a blunt act of internet censorship, Facebook added insult to injury by disabling the account of that site’s creator, 14-year-old Todd Snider.<br />
 <br />
Snider established the Facebook group called “I Wonder How Quickly I Can Find 1,000,000 People Who Support Israel,” in July 2008. By February 2009 it was Facebook’s largest pro-Israel site, with over 180,000 members.<br />
 <br />
But on February 15, 2009, Snider’s Facebook group was hacked and destroyed by a pro-Hizballah group calling itself “Lebanese Shee’a Hackers.” The hackers completely erased the original site content and replaced it with  threatening, obscenity-laced pro-jihad, anti-Israel propaganda datelined Bint Jbeil, South Lebanon: “DEAR ADMINS, DON’T WASTE MY AND YOUR TIME , LEAVE THIS GROUP ITS BETTER FOR BOTH THIS IS THE LAST TIME ILL EDIT YOU INFO , NEXT TIME…”</p>

<p>Facebook allowed the hackers to destroy Snider’s site, answering his repeated entreaties for help with blandly evasive  form letters.<br />
 <br />
And now, after the appearance on March 6  of an article about the incident in FrontPageMagazine.com (“<a href="http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=D64A0388-7FD9-4F8D-86B4-E25D101C7182" target="_blank">Facebook Jihad</a>” by Robert Spencer), Facebook has taken the additional step of disabling Snider’s account altogether, capitulating to the jihadi hackers and accusing Snider himself of “misusing” Facebook’s “features.”<br />
 <br />
Facebook’s outrageous action is not only an assault on free speech and internet freedom and a breach of its own social networking protocols, but also appeasement of a group of hackers who have invaded Facebook’s space and who openly avow their support for the jihad terrorist group Hizballah.<br />
 <br />
We therefore urge all Facebook members who oppose Islamist terror and internet censorship to contact the site administrators through the Facebook contact form, and all others to join us in protesting against Facebook’s outrageous behavior by writing to abuse@facebook.com.<br />
 <br />

<p>I will be asking other prominent bloggers, writers, media figures, lovers of freedom, to join their names to ours in this, and will be adding them. And all bloggers who see this are welcome to post it on your own sites.</p>
