The love part comes from the low cost and integrated design of these graphics cores, while the hate emerges when actually trying to play games and dealing with unplayable framerates or game incompatibilities. The AMD 780G chipset, complete with integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphics, looks to change that and supply gamers with a low-cost integrated graphics solution that can actually play games, while doubling it up as a potential HTPC option. </P><P> <h3>The AMD 780G Chipset</A></h3> </P><P> The AMD 780G chipset is designed to supply a gaming and multimedia base for the everyday consumer. Its integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphics engine is the most powerful IGP-based solution yet, and offers playable framerates with most games, while providing exceptional video and multimedia playback, connectivity and support. The AMD 780G Northbridge is matched with the SB700 Southbridge, combining in a low-cost, energy efficient, mainstream system platform with an exceptional feature set. </P><P> The 780G Northbridge is an eighth-generation IGP, and one that has integrated a fully DirectX 10/SM4.0 graphics core. It also supports HyperTransport 3.0, one PCIe 2.0 x16 slot, up to six PCIe x1 slots, a DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort w/ HDCP interface, and a Unified Video Decoder. We'll get to the graphics core later, but the UVD supports MPEG-2, VC-1, and H.264 formats, and its decoding acceleration requires very low CPU utilization. HT 3.0 supplies a 2.0+ GHz Interface with 41.6 GB/s of aggregate bandwidth, which provides fast chipset to memory access. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/nb.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> The SB700 Southbridge includes a nice selection of features and connectivity options. It links to the 780G Northbridge using a high-speed A-Link Express II interface, and supplies six SATA 3.0 Gb/s ports with RAID/eSATA, a single PATA channel, twelve USB 2.0 and two USB 1.1 ports, a HD audio controller, ACPI specification 3.0 power management, and HyperFlash IDE-Flash technology. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/sb.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>The AMD 780G/HD 3200 Graphics Core</A></h3> </P><P> The 55nm AMD 780G is the first integrated chipset to include a full DirectX 10 core, and its Radeon HD 3200 is the graphics engine that drives the platform. The Radeon HD 3200 sports a unified shader architecture with 40 Stream processors, along with four texture units and four ROPs. This architecture has been taken from the Radeon HD 2400 series, which in turn was also used for the newer Radeon HD 3400 series. </P><P> The default clock speed of the Radeon HD 3200 core is 500 MHz and the memory runs at 400 MHz/800 MHz DDR2 effective. This offers a fillrate of 2.0 GB GTexel/s and means that the AMD 780G has slightly lower performance than the 600 MHz core of the Radeon HD 3450, which features the same basic GPU architecture. As this is an IGP solution, memory bandwidth is tied to the system memory and the speed, bus width and latency of the DDR2. The presence of HT 3.0 also helps memory bandwidth, but for that, you need a Phenom processor. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/chipset.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> The AMD 780G also includes a UVD (Unified Video Decoder), which along with Avivo HD, helps with standard and HD video playback. Support for MPEG-2, VC-1, and H.264 allows a full 1080p visual experience, and the HDCP compliant outputs ensures Blu-ray/HD-DVD playback. The 780G also supports SurroundView, for dual monitors in standard mode, or up to four displays using a dedicated graphics card. </P><P> There is even a design option to include dedicated onboard Display Cache memory, which supplements the unified memory architecture and provides higher gaming performance. You can even overclock the integrated graphics core, and the reference Gigabyte board had this selection in the BIOS (max 1100 MHz). This feature is also available through AMD's OverDrive application, but strangely, this is not adjustable using the Catalyst driver set. In our testing, we couldn't get it much over 700 MHz, while AMD's estimates were at 800 MHz or higher. </P><P> <h3>Hybrid Graphics Technology</A></h3> </P><P> One of the more interesting features of the 780G is its support for Hybrid Graphics. This feature provides the AMD 780G with scalable graphics, by enabling both integrated and discrete graphics cores to work in CrossFire mode, thereby increasing performance by letting the integrated Radeon HD 3200 work alongside the dedicated video card. AMD recommends the Radeon HD 3450 for 780G Hybrid mode scaling, as this card best approximates the performance of the integrated HD 3200 graphics. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/hybrid.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> This sounds great in theory, and it does work, but there are some limitations. For starters, the performance under Hybrid Graphics is limited to the lowest common denominator, and scales to the lowest performing component of the two. That means hooking up a Radeon HD 3800 card would theoretically offer lower performance in Hybrid mode than by itself. We don't have to worry about that scenario, as AMD only supports Hybrid Graphics on the 780G chipset using the Radeon HD 2400 and 3450/3470 video cards. </P><P> <h3>Test Setup</A></h3> </P><P> The AMD 780G chipset is designed to supply the mainstream computing market with the fastest gaming performance yet in an integrated DirectX 10 graphics engine. Due to this, our benchmarking scenario is going to be different, and although the integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphic core offers a top chipset-based graphics solution, it's still an entry-level option, and hardly enough for a real comparison against high-end, or even mainstream dedicated video cards. In terms of the base platform, we're sticking with the 2.5 GHz Athlon X2 4850 supplied with the review kit, as it fits in with the low-power mantra of the 780G platform much better than a high-wattage, quad core Phenom. </P><P> The remainder of the platform consists of the Gigabyte GA-MA78GM-S2H motherboard, which naturally features the AMD 780G chipset, along with 2x1GB of low latency (CAS4) Corsair XMS2 DDR2-800 memory. We also employed a Seagate Barracuda 750GB hard drive and the usual selection of CD/DVD drive and power supply accoutrements. AMD also included a Radeon HD 3450 entry-level graphics card, which we used in Hybrid Graphics testing. As this is a Vista feature, we have naturally moved to Microsoft's latest operating system, and more specifically, Vista Ultimate. </P><P> The benchmarking scenario is a bit different from what we usually produce for reviews, due mostly to the AMD 780G's entry-level graphics performance. As such, we're not going to be hitting the top games at 1920x1200, or jacking the anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering to the upper limits, as we would get either a slide-show or a system lock. Instead, we're going to be looking at the overall performance of the integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphics core, as well as what type of performance jump we get from adding a second entry-level video card and enabling Hybrid Graphics Technology. </P><P> We had intended to include results from an Intel platform with integrated graphics, but this was tougher than we expected, as some of the games we tested cleanly on the AMD system resulted in loading problems or locks with the Intel platform. Even a few that worked displayed graphic inconsistencies and corruption, making it very difficult to make the usual performance comparisons. But while Intel is certainly the place to go for high-end processors and platforms, there is no question the AMD 780G is head and shoulders over the Intel-based integrated graphics - both in performance and compatibility. </P><P> Because of the intention to include an Intel-based system in our testing, the benchmark selection is also a bit less expansive, and squarely locked on gaming performance. Our game benchmark list includes 3DMark06, Unreal Tournament 3, World in Conflict, F.E.A.R., Company of Heroes, Quake 4, and FarCry. Since the AMD 780G is an entry-level graphics solution, we are not expecting high-end performance levels, so our default game benchmark is set at 1024x768x32, while lowering the detail levels for each of the game tests. </P><P> Our first test is at standard detail settings, then increasing that to 2X AA and 4X AF details, or jacking in-game details for those benchmarks that don't fully support driver AA/AF settings. The only exception is 3DMark06, which is tested using its standard 1280x1024 resolution and with no AA/AF options enabled. </P><P> The benchmark results will consist of four different scores. The first is for the AMD 780G/HD 3200 at its default clock speed of 500 MHz, and with no tweaks whatsoever. The second result is for the dedicated Radeon HD 3450 video card, while the third adds in Hybrid gaming support to see if two entry-level GPUs are really better than one. The last benchmark scores examine the theory behind Hybrid Graphics, and if by overclocking the AMD 780G's HD 3200 core to 650MHz, above that of the Radeon HD 3450, if the "lowest common denominator" can be increased, and ramp up performance as a result. </P><P> * Please note that unlesss otherwise stated, such as the media encoding times, all performance graph results equate to the standard "higher is better" routine. </P><P> <h3>Test Systems:</A></h3> </P><P> AMD 780G Reference System:<br/> Processors: Athlon X2 4850 (2.5 GHz)<br/> Memory: 2 x 1GB Corsair XMS2 DDDR2-800 (CAS4)<br/> Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-MA78GM-S2H<br/> Motherboard chip set: AMD 780G<br/> Video Card: Integrated Radeon HD 3200 and discreet Radeon HD 3450<br/> LCD: Dell 2405WFP 24"<br/> ATI reference drivers: 8.452 WHQL for 780G, 8.47 RC2 for Hybrid<br/> Hard-Drive: Seagate Barracuda 750GB<br/> CD/DVD: AOpen DUW1608 16X DVD+/-R DL<br/> Power Supply: Enermax EG651P-VE-24P 550W EPS12V<br/> Operating System: Windows Vista Ultimate (all February </P><P> <h3>3DMark06 Performance</A></h3> </P><P> 3DMark06 Advanced is the latest version of this popular 3DMark series of gaming benchmarks from Futuremark, is the first to showcase new HDR/SM3.0 and SM2.0 graphics tests, and offers a wide range of graphics benchmarks. The Feature tests have also been enhanced to illuminate various types of 3D specifications, and helps provide reliable measurements for game hardware of today and tomorrow. This is one very serious performance test, which punishes cards that do not fully support HDR/SM3.0 or SM2.0, and really puts video hardware to the next-generation test. In this review, we will be concentrating on the overall 3DMark06 score, and some individual benchmark tests covering fill rate and SM2.0/SM3.0 results. </P><P> The first thing to say about the AMD 780G and its Radeon HD 3200 core is that it easily completed the entire 3DMark06 test suite, which is an accomplishment by itself. Even high-end Radeon X19X0-based cards cannot hit all the features tests, and AMD has certainly provided an entry-level DirectX 10 graphics-on-a-chip solution. Our first benchmark result shows the AMD 780G scoring respectably, but still falling back from the higher-clocked Radeon HD 3450. Once we double the GPUs up in Hybrid mode, performance jumps noticeably, and even moves a bit higher with the AMD 780G overclocked to 650 MHz. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/3dmark_2006.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>3DMark06 Advanced Fill Rate Performance</A></h3> </P><P> The next part of our 3DMark06 Pro testing utilizes the Feature Test portion of the benchmark (at the standard 1280x1024 resolution), and concentrates on the Fill Rate performance of the various graphics solutions. This chart shows the cards ranked by Fill Rate performance, with the number displayed representing MTexels/second. </P><P> The Fill Rate benchmark tests show the single-texturing results offers some improvements when we increase the graphics power, but it's the multi-texturing that shows it off to the best effect. In this last test, there is a noticeable jump in fill rate, even showing a nice increase when the AMD 780G is overclocked in Hybrid mode. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/3dmark_2006_det_1.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>3DMark06 Advanced SM2.0 &amp; SM3.0/HDR Performance</A></h3> </P><P> As we ramp up the graphics power, there are the same type of incremental performance bumps in the 3DMark06 SM2.0 &amp; SM3.0/HDR benchmarking, although the SM2.0 scores do not jump by the same level as the SM3.0/HDR testing does. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/3dmark_2006_det_2.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> <h3>Quake 4 Performance</A></h3> </P><P> Quake 4 is the latest in 3D first-person shooters from id Software and Raven, and while the actual storyline is standard fare and the game itself is based on the DOOM 3 engine, the graphics are exceptional and it is an improvement over previous games. The lighting and shadow effects are excellent, and the overall level design and architecture are a real treat. Using high-end resolutions and detail settings, the overall load on the graphics card can still be extreme, but it's still a great benchmark at the lower end. For this test, we have moved to the 1.41 revision, and enabled the game's multi-threaded functionality. Due to its age, there has been no change to Quake 4's detail settings, which remain on High. </P><P> Quake 4 is based on the same engine as DOOM 3, so although we tested both games, the performance charts were very similar, and there is no need to include scores for the older game. Quake 4 offers the same type of performance levels that will become commonplace in our benchmark testing, starting off with average scores, and moving up the scale until we hit almost 40 fps using Hybrid Graphics. The addition of anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering does lower the framerates a bit, but we're still hitting almost 30 fps using Hybrid. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/quake4.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>FarCry Performance</A></h3> </P><P> FarCry is a first-person shooter that takes in-game graphics to the next level, although in a different direction than DOOM 3. Instead of darkness and confined spaces, FarCry places you outdoors, on bright sandy beaches, jungles or even on the water itself. This game gives our GPUs a different kind of a stress test, and FarCry still ranks up there as a tough 3D game benchmark. For this test, we are using the full retail version, a custom game demo and Low detail settings. </P><P> Using a High detail setting yielded unplayable framerates, while the Low setting ramped these up considerably. The base AMD 780G offers playable scores, but once we move to Hybrid Graphics, these surpass 100 fps at standard details. The higher 2X AA/4X AF settings drop the frames accordingly, but we're still looking at almost 70 fps at the top-end. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/farcry.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>F.E.A.R. Performance</A></h3> </P><P> F.E.A.R. is one of the best additions to our game benchmark suite, as it features jaw-dropping graphics and a physics engine that can bring any system to its knees. The game even includes a wide selection of System and Video settings, along with an in-game testing module to keep things 100% comparable. In this case, as we are dealing with entry-level graphics performance, we have set the system, physics and graphics settings to low, getting rid of any CPU limitations and ensuring a playable game environment. </P><P> The F.E.A.R. game scores are also very good, and we again see a steady performance increase as we move from the AMD 780G to the Radeon HD 3450 and finally to Hybrid Graphics. Even at 1024x768 with low details, 100 fps is still nothing to sneeze at. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/fear.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> <h3>Company of Heroes Performance</A></h3> </P><P> Company of Heroes is another of the newer additions to our benchmark suite, and it offers one of the most demanding benchmark environments ever. CoH is a WW2 real-time strategy game, which again provides us with a nice change of pace from the usual FPS benchmark. We use the game's built-in performance test for all of our graphics benchmarking. To give the entry-level AMD 780G a proper test environment, all in-game detail settings have been dropped to low, which both lowers the potential for CPU limitations and properly tunes the game environment for base graphics engines like the Radeon HD 3200 and HD 3450. </P><P> Company of Heroes exhibits many of the same performance trends we've seen in other game benchmarking. The baseline AMD 780G and its HD 3200 graphics core supplies a playable framerate, but the jump to the Radeon HD 3450 is a bit larger than usual. Once we enable Hybrid Graphics, the system pumps out almost 100 fps at standard details, and over 75 fps at 2X AA and 4X AF. This is another very good result for a demanding game benchmark, even at 1024x768. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/coh.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>World in Conflict Performance</A></h3> </P><P> World in Conflict is a real-time tactical combat game, offering some of the usual RTS conventions, as well as a few new twists. Combining elements of Command &amp; Conquer, Call of Duty and Battlefield 2, World in Conflict is a very popular, critically hailed game, and one that certainly exerts a lot of pressure on your graphics hardware. We use the in-game performance test, and since this game has some issues with driver-level AA and AF settings, we have tested at both low and medium details to compensate. </P><P> World in Conflict doesn't show us anything really new, and we still see the same natural progression from the standard AMD 780G graphics up to the Hybrid + Overclocked scores. While AMD's newest integrated graphics offers playable framerates at standard settings, once we activate medium details, the framerates drop considerably. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/wic.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> <h3>Unreal Tournament 3 Performance</A></h3> </P><P> Unreal Tournament 3 is another new addition to our benchmark suite, and it includes some of the best visuals in a PC game. We use a standard benchmarking interface and have selected the Downtown map (in Flyby mode) because of its superb environment, featuring both a sprawling outdoor cityscape and some indoor locations. As with World in Conflict, there are some niggling issue with driver AA and AF support, so we have switched between in-game detail settings of 1 and 3. </P><P> The Unreal Tournament 3 benchmark scores are actually playable at most of the graphics/detail combinations, and even the AMD 780G offers over 35 fps at the base settings. Once details are increased, the value of a Hybrid Graphics solution becomes clear, and the top solution almost hits 50 fps. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/ut3.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> <h3>Benchmark Analysis</A></h3> </P><P> The benchmark results progressed as we anticipated, and followed the natural rule of greater graphics power resulting in higher game scores and framerates. Certainly no surprise there, but the benchmarks did confirm the AMD claims, and showed that Hybrid Graphics is a potentially valuable feature, and one that offers very real framerate increases for potential upgrades. Of course, the reality of Hybrid Graphics is that it only makes sense if you already own an AMD 780G motherboard, and the price-performance of adding a Radeon HD 3450/3470 card makes sense. After all, if your upgrade budget can handle a dedicated GeForce 8600 GT, Radeon X1650 XT or HD 2600 card, then performance will be higher than Hybrid Graphics can offer. </P><P> One of the most impressive features of the AMD 780G and its Radeon HD 3200 integrated graphics is simply that it works as advertised. Certainly, performance is the top challenge facing integrated graphics, but game compatibility ranks right up there as well. As stated earlier, getting all of the game benchmarks to run correctly is always a potential issue in any IGP performance evaluation, but the AMD 780G was indistinguishable from a dedicated video card, and easily handled everything we tossed at it. </P><P> Throughout the benchmark testing, we wanted to evaluate the performance and features of the new AMD 780G chipset, and its integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphics core. This meant full testing in both standard and Hybrid Graphics modes, across a wide range of game environments. Although we had planned to include an integrated graphics core, we wanted to stay away from too many comparisons to dedicated video cards. But that doesn't mean we didn't test a few out to see how the AMD 780G stacked up. </P><P> In terms of overall GPU architecture, the Radeon HD 3200 core is essentially a lower clocked version of the Radeon HD 3450 video card, and exhibits similar performance. In terms of NVIDIA cards, the GeForce 8400 GS would be an adequate comparison, although the HD 3200 does offer a 3DMark06 score on par with the GeForce 8500 GT. </P><P> When used in Hybrid Graphics mode, the AMD 780G + Radeon HD 3450 shows increased performance, and in terms of raw power, moves into GeForce 7600GS/Radeon X1600 territory. This is certainly nothing to get too excited about if you already have a dedicated video card, but it's a nice step forward for integrated graphics, and gives us a point of reference for any potential upgrades. </P><P> One other factor worth mentioning is the potential speed increase that a full HT 3.0 link could provide. Unfortunately, this is only available when using the latest Phenom processors, and as these are power-hungry quad cores, it doesn't fit in with the overall design of the 780G platform. The AMD 780G seems tailor fit for a lower power dual-core, even tri-core, Phenom processor, but these models have yet to be released. This results in a platform best suited to a 45W Athlon X2, but one designed to run best with a Phenom. </P><P> <h3>Power Consumption</A></h3> </P><P> The AMD 780G platform prides itself on its miserly power usage, and AMD advertises the 780G Northbridge as using 15W of power at load, while the SB700 checks in at only 4.5W. Both chips uses approximately 1W at idle. This definitely piqued our interest, as did the 45W AMD Athlon X2 4850, and AMD's intention to push the 780G chipset in the power-conscious HTPC market. We put this to the test with the same hardware configuration we used in the benchmark testing. </P><P> At idle, the AMD 780G platform used between 55W and 60W, and while running a high-end 3D game test, power usage ramped up to the 90-95W range. Our torture test of a Sandra CPU benchmark plus the PCMark Vantage Gaming test (to be sure both the CPU and GPU were fired up) all running concurrently only pushed the system to the 95-100W level, with a few spikes over the 100W barrier. These are excellent resuults, and sticking under 100W in a demanding environment is very impressive. </P><P> Part of this comes from the low power components, like the processor and chipset, but there are also design considerations as well. The Gigabyte board was a power-saving mATX model, with no cooling fans present on either the Northbridge or Southbridge. This space-saving, low-noise design also pays off in the power department, and automatically offers lower power usage than a high-end platform with NB/SB cooling fans on a full-size ATX or Extended ATX format. </P><P> Please keep in mind that these numbers relate to total system power consumption, of which the chipset is only one </P><P> <h3>Value</A></h3> </P><P> The Gigabyte GA-MA78GM-S2H motherboard we used in all AMD 780G testing is expected to retail for under $100, and you receive a lot of value for the money. In addition to the integrated Radeon HD 3200 graphics, you get full AM2+ support for Phenom and Athlon 64 X2 processors, a PCI Express 2.0 interface, integrated HDMI/DVI output, HD audio, SATA 3Gb/s with RAID, and Hybrid Graphics Technology. This board competes very well in its target market, and would be at home in either a desktop or HTPC configuration. </P><P> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/img/2008/03/amd_780g/logo.jpg" border="0"> </P><P> </P><P> * Please note that these prices were taken at the time of review and are not meant to reflect long-term trends. </P><P> <h3>Conclusion</A></h3> </P><P> The release of the 780G chipset lets AMD lay claim to the integrated graphics performance crown, as the Radeon HD 3200 core offers the best IGP-based solution on the market. Software support is also excellent, and by incorporating an existing DirectX 10 GPU into a motherboard chipset, AMD has ensured that game compatibility will not be a major issue. Power consumption is also very low, especially when coupled with a low-power Athlon X2, which makes the 780G perfect for a HTPC implementation. But while gaming performance is great for an integrated solution, it's still well back of even some entry-level cards, so don't go in expecting to play Crysis at full detail settings. </P><P> Pros: * Fastest Integrated Graphics Solution * Exceptional Game Compatibility * Low Power Usage * Dream HTPC Platform </P><P> Cons: * Baseline Gaming Performance * Hybrid Graphics May Not Be Economical * Designed for a Phenom Dual/Triple Core </P><P> Ratings:</P><P> <br/> <IMG src="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/i/1x/guide.gif" border=0> </P><i>Author:</i> Vince Freeman<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/hardware/motherboards/article.php/3732211" target="_blank">Read article at Internet.com site</a>
