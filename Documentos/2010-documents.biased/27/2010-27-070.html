Relative to the previous version of the PCMark06, PCMark  Vantage has the overall structure of the more obvious changes, from the  previous several subsystems according to the gradual change in PC-use  classification in accordance with sub-items, closer to the user��s  actual use is also more focused on the the user��s reference value  larger. It canceled the original processor and graphics sub-items,  retained the overall system score and the HDD (hard disk) two  sub-items, while increasing Memories (memories), TV and Movie (video),  Gaming (games), Music (Music ), Communication (communication),<a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-clevo-m375c-battery-p-963.html" rel="nofollow">Clevo M375C battery</a> and Productivity (productivity) of several new projects. More appropriate measure of PC performance for home entertainment.</p>  <p>PCMark Vantage points from the 3585��s overall test scores of view,  this 5542G configured dual-core processors, high-performance graphics  to have a relatively high test scores is the key, for the general user,  a higher score on behalf of its use home entertainment applications  will be even better performance is unquestionable, while more than  3,000 sub-test scores also show that with such a configuration and  performance of 5542G in the application to meet the vast majority of  home entertainment needs of everyday use. <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-clevo-m375e-battery-p-964.html" rel="nofollow">Clevo M375E battery</a></p>  <p>From the classification test scores to see, Memories (memories), TV  and Movie (video) and Gaming (games) of these three sub-items of the  test scores while in 2000 more points, but lower than the average  scores, from the official White Paper on Futuremark these three  sub-tests of the explanations of view, the trend of such results occur  mainly due to these two items in the test of the graphics processing  power and memory-related performance, etc. have certain requirements.</p>  <p>From the Music (Music), Communication (communication), and  Productivity (productivity) and several in the test too much reliance  on the disk, processor performance, achievements of the sub-tests,  5542G is equipped with a 320GB hard disk has a relatively good  performance of to meet the 45nm dual-core processor technology. Its  comprehensive performance to meet most of the day to day office and  home entertainment applications are perfectly.</p>  <p>Display System Performance Testing</p>  <p>In the graphic part of the test, we have adopted the latest  Futuremark test software 3DMark Vantage, which is the industry��s first  dedicated DX10 API interface based on Microsoft, Windows Vista  operating system to create a comprehensive benchmarking tool that can  give full play to multiple graphics cards, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-clevo-m375ew-battery-p-965.html" rel="nofollow">Clevo M375EW battery</a>  the advantages of multi-core processors, you can in the current and  future systems for some time to meet the PC gaming performance testing  needs. 3DMark Vantage provides a new project to build the two graphics  tests, two-processor test items, six characteristics of test items, and  the introduction of four different levels of parameters of the default  (Preset), can be more closely reflect the system performance level. In  the test, we will adjust the same system resolution 1024 �� 768, using  the test software provided by the Entry mode for testing.</p>  <p>The test results from the above perspective, the use of HD 4570  graphics card, so this 5542G in this part of the test results were  again very satisfactory, and 4595 points score and 5204 of the GPU  integrated test scores indicate that this product can cope with the  mainstream The gaming applications, while Turion II Dual-Core Mobile  M500 processor, a test score of 3401 points, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-clevo-m385c-battery-p-967.html" rel="nofollow">Clevo M385C battery</a> just enough to cope with large-scale 3D games and applications. .</p>  <p>We have also used TOPCON��s BM-7 spectral Chroma Meter to the 5542G��s  screen were tested in the test, we chose the right screen brightness,  contrast and color saturation test. Brightness test, we let the  full-screen display shows a white screen on the center of the screen  test, contrast tests also used the same testing methods. Measurement of  color saturation, respectively, when we let the display shows the red  (R), green (G), blue (B), and then test the focal point of the color  values of the screen. In the CIE color space R, G, B three points of a  triangle that is surrounded by monitors can display all the color  regions, the region��s area and NTSC 1953 the definition of the scope of  RGB color space is the color saturation ratio score. sRGB standard  definition of the color range of approximately 71% NTSC, which is  normal CRT monitors can now meet the standard.</p>  <p>In the test, we actually test for the optimization of brightness  353cd/m2, contrast ratio compared to 425.1:1, color saturation, the  test values for 51.38%. From the final test result, it seems, ACER  5542G is equipped with LCD screen has a nice piece of the brightness of  indicators, their 353cd / ? the measured data than the prevailing  market 250cd / ? excellent level of some, while the contrast and color  saturation of the indicators are is currently on the market similar  products in the average. Combining our trial experience in the test  run, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-business-notebook-6720sct-battery-p-981.html" rel="nofollow">HP Business Notebook 6720s/CT battery</a>  ACER 5542G��s LCD screen, this piece has a very good light because of  the performance, so its reading, including text, video playback, etc.  better than the performance of similar products.</p>  <p>Mainstream 3D Game Test</p>  <p>The introduction of the 3DMark Vantage on this product to test the  graphics processing power of the I, we have also selected the three  mainstream PC games for the performance of the practical application of  this product has been tested, tested the game includes ��Street Fighter  IV��, , ��Resident Evil 5? and ��Farcry2: Far Cry 2?, where ��Street  Fighter IV��, ��Resident Evil 5? We have adopted an official Capcom  release testing procedures to detect, while the ��Farcry2: Far Cry 2? we  are the use of a full version of the game play test DEMO testing  methods. In the test, we installed the English version of Microsoft  Windows 7 Ultimate Version 6.1.7600 version of the operating system to  be tested.</p>  <p>PC version of ��Street Fighter IV�� is the console version of the full  port, will correspond to the Game for Windows Live features, support  online Battle, in-game voice chat and instant messaging communication.  In addition to supporting high-definition PC version of the screen  output, he also gives players a screen rendering style selection of  functions, except with the console version of the same ��normal�� mode,  there are ��Watercolor��, ��Poster�� and ��soot ink ��It��s three kinds of  additional rendering styles. Players in the game settings options, it  can be shown according to their preferences on the effects of mediation.</p>  <p>In the test we have adopted a Capcom official PC performance testing software to test, test software, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-business-notebook-6730sct-battery-p-980.html" rel="nofollow">HP Business Notebook 6730s/CT battery</a>  including three Battle playback video, and eight roles in the same  venue put POSE test mode, players will eventually show the results of  PC hardware evaluation.</p>  <p>We have chosen four kinds of resolution to run this test, namely,  800X600, 1024X768, 1280X720, as well as a standard notebook resolution  1366X768, the rest of the game is set to use the default settings.</p>  <p>From the final test results, the higher this 5542G hardware  configuration makes it even in 1366X768 resolution, even under the game  can run smoothly, and because of the HD4570 is equipped with discrete  graphics, so even with the highest 1366X768 pixel resolution rate, can  also get almost 30FPS smooth speed. <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-business-notebook-6735s-battery-p-983.html" rel="nofollow">HP Business Notebook 6735s battery</a></p>  <p>��Resident Evil 5? is already the 5th generation of this game, and  this ��Resident Evil 5? the stage is set in a small African country (the  story is purely fictional), the country is located in stretches Eritrea  (Eritrea), Ethiopia (Ethiopia ) and Kenya (Kenya) to bring the three  countries of the active volcano. The game begins, local residents had  not been infected, but with the outbreak of volcanic activity, the  virus spread and local residents gradually became similar to the Dead��s  killing bio.</p>  <p>In the test we have adopted a Capcom official PC performance testing  software testing, test software provides two kinds of test modes,  respectively, are fixed scene and change the scene mode, fixed-scene  mode, the software will be the first-person perspective to observe the  fixed scenarios to arrive at the final test scores. And the changing  scene of the game mode is applied through the two main characters in  the game action for the four scenarios test players will eventually  show the results of PC hardware evaluation. In this part of the test,  we use the 800X600, 1024X768 and 1280X720 resolution of these three  models were tested.</p>  <p>From some of the test run, this 5542G at 800X600, 1024X768 pixel  resolution, the game is still under no problem, in 800X600 resolution,  the average frame rate achieved under the 40.9FPS, and 1024X768  resolution can be achieved even under 30.1FPS , can be very smooth  conduct of the game. However, in 1280X720 pixel resolution can only be  achieved under 24FPS speed, although it could play games, but the pause  screen will appear a certain sense, affecting fluency in the game.</p>  <p>Resident Evil 5 with the game, like the scene shifted to Africa, Far  Cry 2 (Farcry2) the story of the same place in the heart of the African  continent. Compared to its predecessor, this made the game environment  more detailed, the hardware requirements are higher.</p>  <p>In the test, we use a full version of the game to conduct tests  using a fixed DEMO, we chose four kinds of resolution to run this test,  namely, 800X600, 1024X768, 1280X720, as well as a standard notebook  resolution 1366X768, The remaining settings using the default settings  the game testing tools. <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-business-notebook-6820s-battery-p-984.html" rel="nofollow">HP Business Notebook 6820s battery</a></p>  <p>From the final outcome, this 5542G-pixel resolution in the 800X600  performance under the best score of 28.58FPS, while in 1024X768 pixels,  1280X720 pixel and 1366X768 pixel resolution, the results have failed  to more than 23FPS, were only 22.35FPS , 19.89FPS and 18.27FPS, such as  test scores show that, to this 5542G configuration, and can not be a  good way to cope with Farcry2 large-scale hardware demanding 3D games.</p>  <p>Three games a comprehensive look at test scores to the configuration  of this 5542G payable under the lower resolution in some present, most  of the mainstream games are no problem, users can be rest assured that  the adoption of this laptop play some mainstream 3D games However, if  the user intends to increase the resolution, it will directly affect  the game fluency.</p>  <p>Battery life Proficiency Test</p>  <p>5542G comes standard with a 11.1V, 4400mAh lithium-ion batteries, we  mainly adopted the Mobile Mark2007 software to simulate the daily  office and multimedia productions for major applications, the ability  to conduct a comprehensive assessment of endurance. MobileMark 2007 is  a notebook based on real-world battery life and performance evaluation  software. It supports 64bit/32bit versions of Windows Vista / XP  (Professional / Home). It has three kinds of test modes: Productivity  module, DVD module, Reader module, respectively, HP Compaq 2710 Tablet  PC Ultra-slim Series battery will be called Adobe AcrobatReader 7.0,  Adobe Illustrator CS2, Adobe Photoshop CS2, Apple Quicktime 7.1,  Intervideo WinDVD 8, Macromedia Flash 8, Microsoft Office 2003 Pro,  Microsoft Project 2003, Winzip 10.0. In a notebook, we will run the  Productivity module and the DVD module 2 test, and record their  performance scores and battery life. In the Internet of this, we will  run the Reader module and the DVD module. In this product we have  tested the high-intensity office and DVD playback two links, which  links high-intensity office routine office simulation run the user  access to all the software, and the system will be mixed, ranging from  intermittent time to the maximum extent simulate the user operating  environment. The DVD test part is simulated home environment, the more  extreme DVD playback test, we tested a DVD module used the virtual  drive, the computer test to read data from hard drives, so the test  data with the use of CD-ROM drive will have a certain bias, However, we  believe that such a test method rather than the use of DVD drive to  read more close to the user��s habits, After all, most used in the video  playback is still more to read data from the hard drive.</p>  <p>In the test, we turn off screensavers, sleep, and set the battery  and the system are the highest performance mode, in the office  environment, test segments, 5542G��s piece of the battery capacity in  the remaining 4% of the conditions to provide users with 131 minutes of  life , while the DVD playback tests of some of the final score of 151  minutes. HP Compaq 2710 Tablet battery can be said that such a result  for a hardware configuration using a high performance entertainment  notebook, the end-user acceptance is entirely possible, after all, most  of them choose this notebook users more of this product will be desktop  as an alternative, so the battery as a power-down state for more  emergency power supply means, such as battery life, power outages in a  short time or a state of calm enough to make the end user the work at  hand to avoid the loss suffered because of power failure.</p>  <p>Power consumption and heat test</p>  <p>Actual power consumption test</p>  <p>We also tested the product��s actual power usage, we have tested this  product in three kinds of state power dissipation. We use UNI-T UT71E  intelligent digital multimeter for testing equipment, were determined  to connect the power but not turned on (non-charge state), the system  boot is completed, no action within 5 minutes, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-436426351-battery-p-1019.html" rel="nofollow">HP 436426-351 battery</a>  but do not sleep (non-charge state) as well as system startup is  completed, processor is full, the disk maximum throughput of work  (non-charge state), the power consumption of the situation.</p>  <p>In these three conditions, 5542G power consumption respectively,  0.7W, 19.7W and 46.7W, such as test data with a number of similar  configurations on the market compared to the notebook at a relatively  high level, so that the test data showed that this product due to use  of high-performance components, we have less power consumption is also  rising more obvious, users enjoy high performance at the same time, we  must accept the resulting higher power consumption.</p>  <p>Heat test</p>  <p>In this test link, we have adopted a FLUKE The Ti25 thermal imaging  instruments for this product heat conducted a test to test the main  measurement notebooks C face, <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-550-battery-p-848.html" rel="nofollow">HP 550 battery</a>  bottom and the cooling temperature of the mouth. In the test, we use  the EVEREST software, select the System Stability Test, check all of  the items tested after 15 minutes, and we measure the indoor  temperature, the test data to make the reader a more intuitive  understanding.</p>  <p>Our test platform around the five points of the temperature tests,  5-point temperature, respectively 25.7,25.7,25.6,25.2 and 25.5 degrees  Celsius, take average of 25.5 degrees Celsius.</p>  <p>From the test image point of view, this notebook C-surface heating  control of the relative general, C heating surface area mainly  concentrated in the left side of the keyboard and palmrest the location  of surface heating from the C image map we can see, C heating surface  area of the temperature were 39-42 degrees, C face contact with users  and more to the left of the maximum temperature reached 42.1 degrees,  and the environment temperature is 16.6 degrees.</p>  <p>Heat from the D surface imaging map view, D of the heating surface  area concentrated in the central and cooling of the body back <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-compaq-6530b-battery-p-847.html" rel="nofollow">HP Compaq 6530B battery</a>  out of vent area, which is near the location of the core components of  5542G. The images from the test compared with the temperature scale, we  can see that most of the region maintained at a temperature of 39  degrees, while the D surface measurement of the maximum temperature of  40.9 degrees Celsius, the temperature is higher than the normal body  temperature.</p>  <p>IT168 Testing Center point: lower prices and higher home  entertainment performance is the product of the two outstanding selling  points</p>  <p>After reading the evaluation, our evaluation engineers feel this  product is ��a pretty good home entertainment machine��, while in the  query of our IT168 Product Center collection offer this product, we  feel into a ��one �C paragraph pretty good, very value of the home  entertainment machine. <a href="http://www.batteryready.com/replacement-hp-451085141-battery-p-969.html" rel="nofollow">HP 451085-141 battery</a>  �� Can be said that the high-frequency dual-core 2.2GHz processor, HD  4570 graphics card, 2GB RAM, 320GB of hardware is fairly consistent  with the current general home entertainment user��s needs is targeted at  home entertainment most current models of the almost universal  configuration . Almost the same in the configuration, based on the  price of consumer choice has become so critical condition, this Acer  5542G of the market price is only around 4,500 yuan, compared with  several similar configurations are in 5000 prices yuan, which is 500  yuan or so of the price advantage is sufficient to a considerable  portion of the budget constraints the user��s final choice.</p>  <p>Come to talk about the performance of this product, from the  previous evaluation, we can see, HP Compaq 2710p Tablet batterythis  product is very good interpretation of the definition of AMD on the  VISION technology, nor live up to the Extreme Edition (Ultimate) level  represents the meaning of, and its response home entertainment-related  test, not only have a relatively good performance, while its  performance in various applications are also more balanced, there was  no ��partiality�� of the phenomenon, which also shows the hardware  configuration of its balance.</p>  <p>Seen the performance, we take a look at what this product really  suitable for the user bar, the article also mentioned earlier, AMD  official VISION definition of technology which is not very recommended  users to use the notebook to the most basic configuration VISION play  games, because games are not this level of application of the product  flagship for VISION Deluxe Edition (Premium) users, AMD is recommended  to run in a number of casual games, and a small 3D game, VISION Extreme  Edition (Ultimate) version will be able to Basic to meet the mainstream  gaming experience, and our tests of AMD is also very good proof of this  position: If you are a user to play high-end 3D games, then it is clear  that this product is equipped with HD 4570 graphics cards can not meet  your requirements. HP Compaq 2710p Tablet battery The Acer 5542G which  is more suitable for those who usually with some 3D gaming, the  mainstream stand-alone 3D gaming, home video entertainment applications  as the main target of the user, of course, this product to meet the  general office applications is also no problem, if you are looking for  A cheap, while still satisfying the entertainment and office needs of  15-inch notebook, then consider this Acer Aspire 5542G-502G32Mn bar.</p>  </div>
