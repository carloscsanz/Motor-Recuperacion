There is a popular story that Newton was sitting under an apple tree, an apple
fell on his head, and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of Gravitation.
As in all such legends, this is almost certainly not true in its details,
 but the story
contains elements of what actually happened.

<h2>What Really Happened with the Apple?</h2>
Probably the more correct version of the story is that Newton, upon observing
an apple fall from a tree, began to think along the following lines:  
The apple is accelerated, since its velocity
changes from zero as it is hanging on the tree and moves toward the ground.
Thus, by Newton's 2nd Law there must be a force that acts on the apple to cause
this acceleration.  Let's
call this force "gravity", and the associated acceleration the "accleration due
to gravity".  
Then imagine the apple tree is twice as high.  Again,
we expect the apple to be accelerated toward the ground, so this suggests that
this force that we call gravity reaches to the top of the tallest 
apple tree.  

<h2>Sir Isaac's Most Excellent Idea</h2>
Now came Newton's truly brilliant
insight:  if the force of gravity reaches to the top of the highest tree, might
it not reach even further; in particular, might it not reach all the way
to the orbit of the Moon! Then,  the
orbit of the Moon about the Earth could be a consequence of the gravitational
force, because the acceleration due to gravity could change the velocity of the
Moon in just such a way that it followed an orbit 
around the earth.  
<p>
This can be illustrated with the thought experiment shown in the
following figure.  Suppose we fire a cannon horizontally from a high mountain;
the projectile will eventually fall to earth, as indicated by the shortest
trajectory in the figure, because of the gravitational
force directed toward the center of the Earth and the associated acceleration.
(Remember that an acceleration is a
change in velocity and that velocity is a vector, so it has both a magnitude
and a direction.  Thus, an acceleration occurs if either or both the magnitude
and the direction of the velocity change.)  
<p align="center">
<img src="cannonS.jpg" width=399 height=430>
</p>
But as we increase the muzzle velocity for our imaginary cannon, the projectile
will travel further and further before returning to earth.
Finally, Newton reasoned that if the cannon projected the cannon ball with
exactly the right velocity, the projectile would travel completely around the
Earth, always falling in the gravitational field but never reaching the Earth,
which is curving away at the same rate that the projectile falls. 
That is, 
<em>the cannon ball would have
been put into orbit around the Earth.</em>
  Newton concluded that the orbit of the
Moon was of exactly the same nature:  the Moon continuously "fell" in its path 
around the Earth because of the acceleration due to gravity, thus producing its
orbit.
<a name="universal"><p></a>
By such reasoning, Newton came to the conclusion that any two objects in the
Universe exert gravitational attraction on each other,  with the 
force having a universal form:

<p align="center">
<img src="gravity.gif" width=400 height=400>
</p>
The constant of proportionality G is known as the <em>universal gravitational
constant</em>.  It is termed a "universal constant" because it is thought
to be the same at all
places and all times, and thus universally 
characterizes the intrinsic strength of the
gravitational force.

<h2>The Center of Mass for a Binary System</h2>

If you think about it a moment, it may seem a little strange that in Kepler's
Laws the Sun is fixed at a point in space and the planet revolves around it.
Why is the Sun privileged?  Kepler had rather mystical ideas about
the Sun, endowing it with almost god-like qualities that justified its special
place.
However Newton, largely as a corollary of his 3rd Law,
demonstrated that the situation actually was more symmetrical than Kepler
imagined and that the Sun does not occupy a privileged postion; 
in the process he modified Kepler's 3rd Law.
<p>

Consider the  diagram shown to the right.  
We may define a point called the <em>center of
mass</em> between two objects through the equations
<p align="center">
<img src="centermass2.gif" width=198 height=83>
</p>
where R is the total separation between the centers of the two objects.
The center of mass is familiar to anyone who has ever played on a see-saw.
The fulcrum 
point at which the see-saw will exactly balance two people sitting on
either end is the center of mass for the two persons sitting on the see-saw.

<h2>Newton's Modification of Kepler's Third Law</h2>
Because for every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction, Newton realized that in the planet-Sun system the planet
does not orbit around a stationary Sun.  Instead, Newton proposed that both the
planet and the Sun orbited around the common center of mass for the planet-Sun
system.  He then modified Kepler's 3rd Law to read,
<p align="center">
<img src="centermass3.gif" width=397 height=41> 
</p>
where P is the planetary orbital period and the other
quantities have the meanings described above, with the Sun as one
mass and the planet as the other mass.  (As in the earlier discussion of Kepler's
3rd Law, this form of the equation assumes that masses are measured in solar masses, times in
Earth years, and distances in astronomical units.)  Notice the symmetry of this equation:
since the masses are added on the left side and the distances are added on the
right side, it doesn't matter whether the Sun is labeled with 1 and the planet
with 2, or <em>vice-versa</em>.  One obtains the same result in either case.
<p>
Now notice what happens in Newton's new equation if one of the masses (either 1
or 2; remember the symmetry) 
is very large compared with the other.  In particular, suppose the Sun is
labeled as mass 1, and its mass
 is much larger than the mass for any of the planets.
Then the sum of the two masses is always approximately equal to the mass of the
Sun, and if we take ratios of Kepler's 3rd Law for two different planets the
masses cancel from the ratio and we are left with  the
<a href="javascript:locscrollmenu('kepler.html','newton',650,450)">
original form</a> of Kepler's 3rd Law:
<p align="center">
<img src="kepler3.gif" width=142 height=87>
</p>
Thus Kepler's 3rd Law is approximately valid because the Sun is much more
massive than any of the planets and therefore
Newton's correction is small.  The data Kepler had access to were not good
enough to show this small effect.  However,
detailed observations made after Kepler show that Newton's modified form of
Kepler's 3rd Law is in better accord with the data than Kepler's original form.

<h2>Two Limiting Cases</h2>

We can gain further insight by considering the position of the center of mass
in two limits.  First consider the example just addressed, where one mass
is much larger than the other.  Then, we see that the center of mass for the
system essentially concides with the center of the massive object:
<p align="center">
<img src="centermass4.gif" width=396 height=68>
</p>
This is the situation in the Solar System:  the Sun is so massive compared with
any of the planets that the center of mass for a Sun-planet pair is always
very near the center of the Sun.  
Thus, for all practical purposes the Sun IS almost
(but not quite) motionless at the center of mass for the system, as Kepler
originally thought.
<p>
However, now consider the other limiting case where the two masses are equal to
each other.  
Then it is easy to see that the center of mass lies equidistant
from the two masses and if they are gravitationally bound to each other,
each mass orbits the common center of mass for the
system lying midway between them:
<p align="center">
<img src="centermass5.gif" width=397 height=67>
</p> 
This situation occurs commonly with 
<a href="javascript:locscrollmenu('../../../../astr162/lect/binaries/visual.html',
'newton',650,450)">binary stars</a> 
(two stars bound
gravitationally to each other so that they revolve around their common center
of mass).  In many binary star systems the masses of the two stars are similar
and Newton's correction to Kepler's 3rd Law is very large.  
<p>
Here is a 
<a href="javascript:launch('../../../astr162/lect/binaries/visual/keplermodframe.html',
'java',720,380)">Java applet</a> that implements Newton's modified form of Kepler's 3rd
law for two objects (planets or stars) revolving around their common center of mass.
By making one mass much larger than the other in this interactive animation you can
illustrate the ideas discussed above and recover Kepler's original form of his 3rd Law
where a less massive object appears to revolve around a massive object fixed at one focus
of an ellipse.
<p>
These limiting cases for the location of the center of mass
are perhaps familiar from our afore-mentioned playground
experience.
If persons of equal weight are on a see-saw, the fulcrum must be
placed in the middle to balance, but if one person weighs much more than the
other person, the fulcrum must be placed close to the heavier person to
achieve
balance.

Here is a 
<a href="javascript:launch('../../../symantec/kepler3Lawframe.html','applet',
780,400)">Kepler's Laws Calculator</a> that allows you to make simple calculations for
periods, separations, and masses for Keplers' laws as modified by Newton (see subsequent
section) to include the effect of the center of mass.  (<em>Caution:</em>  this applet

browsers.)


<h2>Weight and the Gravitational Force</h2>

We have seen that in the Universal Law of Gravitation the crucial quantity is
mass.  In popular language mass and weight are often used to mean the same
thing; in reality they are related but quite different things.  What we
commonly call weight is really just the 
<em>gravitational force</em>
 exerted on an
object of a certain mass.  We can illustrate by choosing 
the Earth as one of the two masses
in the previous illustration of the Law of Gravitation:
<p align="center">
<img src="weight.gif" width=400 height=440>
</p>
Thus, the weight of an object of mass <em>m</em> at the surface of the Earth is obtained
by multiplying the mass <em>m</em> by the acceleration due to gravity, 
<em>g</em>, at the surface
of the Earth. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately the product of
the universal gravitational constant <em>G</em> and the mass of the Earth 
<em>M</em>, 
divided by the radius of the Earth, <em>r</em>, squared.  
(We assume the Earth to be
spherical and neglect the radius of the object relative to the radius of the
Earth in this discussion.) The measured gravitational acceleration at the
Earth's surface is found to be about 980 cm/second/second. 

<h2>Mass and Weight</h2>

Mass is a measure of how much material is in an object, but 
weight is a measure of
the gravitational force exerted on that material in a gravitational field;
thus, mass and weight are proportional to each other, with the acceleration due
to gravity as the proportionality constant.
It follows that
mass is constant for an object (actually this is not quite true, but we
will save that surprise for our later discussion of the 
<a href="javascript:locscrollmenu('einstein.html','newton',650,450)">
Relativity Theory</a>), 
but weight depends on the location of the object.
For example, if we transported the preceding object of mass 
<em>m</em> to the surface of
the Moon, the gravitational acceleration would change because the radius and
mass of the Moon both differ from those of the Earth.  Thus, our object
has mass <em>m</em>
both on the surface of the Earth and on the surface of the Moon, but it
will <em>weigh</em> much less on the surface of the Moon
because the gravitational acceleration there is a factor of 6
less than at the surface
of the Earth.
