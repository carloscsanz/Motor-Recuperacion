				<small>March 6th, 2010 <!-- by admin --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>&#8220;Chinese Ghost Story OL&#8221; is a test in recent games, was the player of the game looking forward to one of the highest degree. Out of which it published a number of features, as well as the beautiful screenshots have enough players who ignited passions. However, the reason I chose the game is entirely due to the &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story,&#8221; the film a soft spot, especially the touching story that has long been deeply buried in my heart.</p>
<p>Early into the game, feeling is very good. While today&#8217;s test machine is different from the previous test configuration, but in such a test configuration, you can still achieve such a result I am very satisfied. As a 2.5D game, to have such a screen and large the system is really few. And everywhere to show the humanity out of settings, but also let me have a play to go on faith. However, after nearly six hours of testing, I began to confusion, though I can not say that it run out of steam, but now I know what to do really do not know what to do should go to the following for all our friends on the evaluation under this titles of each system.</p>
<p>Game screen</p>
<p>For most 2.5D game, the game screen is really very good. Its various interfaces with color descriptions of the characters portrayed can say is almost perfect. While better than &#8220;Dragon Sword&#8221; This kind of super game, but compared with some claiming to be 2.5D classic win too many games too much. Especially in the game will often see the ancient Chinese-style interface, but also very excited to enable small side. While in some scenes, there are still BUG points, or slightly rough portrayal of individual buildings, but harmless.</p>

<p>Added weather effects</p>
<p>NetEase new work &#8211; &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story OL&#8221; evaluation</p>
<p>The main game interface, all aspects of characterization are considered carefully</p>
<p>Play Audio</p>
<p>I have long ago failed to make an assessment of a game&#8217;s sound, but today&#8217;s game certainly worth to me about sound. The game&#8217;s sound problem with most of the game is being tested the same as the background music, sometimes not. But this question I think in the near future will be resolved out, we can not more critical. Although intermittent, but this game is for both music and sound effects are very good, especially the poignant background music, so that the small edge into the game itself it seems to feel, it is really wonderful. This game is the music are different in various scenes, while the sound emitted by the various monsters, and characters who hit a monster sound is different, for a still in the testing phase of the game is really hard to come by.</p>
<p>NetEase new work &#8211; &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story OL&#8221; evaluation</p>
<p>For example, among the music of this scene is very bleak, and there is a sense of terror</p>
<p>Game task</p>
<p>On the current trends, there is no game would give up the game the task of this system, this made no exception. Overall, the task of setting the game is still relatively good, at least there will be no significant deficiencies. First, referring to the next task of the story background, most of the tasks are around the &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story&#8221; is the story background, development, and each task has a period of not less than the story. Especially the story missions, each a plot of the story missions are attracts players, if carefully read it will really be touched by these stories. The background story of such a task than some similar games may be more eager to excel in a number of similar game itself, the task is not clear even describe, let alone what is the story background.</p>
<p>However, when the task form, the escape is also popular for little a little bit of innovation. Shaguai, tracing, digging materials, recycling recycling recycling, recycling them without limits. If you have been this way, you can rise to high, then the small side, they do not say anything. However, this game seemed to be in guiding the players in the 20, after the significant increase of task difficulty, and if the task of doing the same level of the small side could not be completed alone, but for casual gamers who team the game is not very easy thing to do Therefore, it led me to the medium did not know what to do. Tasks that are more easily done quickly, and the rest of the more difficult the task will not necessarily be able to complete even if the team is really a difficult position.</p>
<p>Also for the NetEase such companies, I personally think that automatically find some way to be more perfect. Now do not support auto-searching road scene searching cross-road, do not support the best route wayfinding, or even faster wayfinding bar, very inconvenient. While pathfinding is currently no stuck in the wrong, or look for the phenomenon, but this is still inconvenient pathfinding defects, hope that we can improve.</p>

<p>Task interface</p>
<p>NetEase new work &#8211; &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story OL&#8221; evaluation</p>
<p>The small side was surrounded by a very tragic, so that the task of how to complete the single</p>
<p>A copy of the system</p>
<p>This game is a copy of the system is relatively fairly large, in the beginning there are 10 copies or so. But the difficulty is concerned, people are really silent. Take for example, 20 copies of the task, we have an average of six series in the 25 people who entered into the group went out three times inside. That monster is only one, that is, BOSS, can be easily cut two seconds off the next one, although easier to revive, but the resurrection of the money used by many small edge-to-last is the resurrection of the penny is not left, only to give up .</p>
<p>Although you can rely on with such a copy, but for casual people, it is impossible to achieve the kind with the realm. Then the bulk of people how to live a copy of the player, I am afraid only to a higher series would be re-back, and if that is not difficult to exterminate, then re-enter, but also wish to complete. However, a copy is needed into the physical strength and vitality, physical strength relies entirely on-line time to fill full, and vitality is to increase by Shaguai team, this set a lot of players want to completely smashed several attempts to dream.</p>
<p>Personal feeling that the setting is not very reasonable, and not every player has a union, and also not every trade union has an expert to help with a good band. So it is very difficult to copy and tasks to complete a lot of players can not, we can only give up, it would be a heavy blow to a player&#8217;s self-confidence, thus losing the courage to go on playing.</p>

<p>Is this guy, spike all of our players</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>Other systems in a matter of time because of the game, the small side not coming into contact with. But this game is the equipment of the system can be considered a feature of this equipment are all made among the score, the score the stronger the higher the equipment, this set is still relatively rare in other games, and also greatly facilitates the identification of equipment, players good or bad. Additionally, the game is quite novice prompted to do place, in the event of issue, the emergence of novice help is always just right, it seems the development side in this respect and made a lot of effort to.</p>
<p>NetEase new work &#8211; &#8220;Chinese Ghost Story OL&#8221; evaluation</p>
<p>Equipment Rating</p>
<p>Sohyo</p>
<p>This game is generally pretty good. Some features can be set up is still relatively attractive, but for some novice players and a few pairs of these online games is not very understanding in terms of players, this game get started on the somewhat difficult. In particular, to the 20 after the task, or a copy of both are quite difficult, to play a direct cause of these players do not go on. Want to upgrade there is no simple task to do a little, wanted to do was not well equipped with materials, then to go do? Therefore, I suggest that more consideration to the development side, under new players will be part of the task slightly more difficult to reduce, you can let these players go to play, otherwise, will only lead to the loss of these players.</p>

					<p>Gentlemen soldiers! &#8220;Battlefield: Bad Company  2&#8243; (PC / PlayStation 3/Xbox 360. Below, Bad Company 2) And yes the 2010  is released on March 11. 12 February As mentioned  in the article on the Sun, β with the key code can now participate in  the PC version of the test, Amazon EA STORE and you have already started  in, January 29 beginning from the date version of Xbox 360 Following the  demonstration of delivery, February 19 from the date of the PlayStation 3  that also started to distribute the demo version of a war between the  well-Areyoareyo. Had in place!</p>
<p>&#8220;Battlefield: Bad Company  2&#8243; official website</p>
<p>Quietly appeared in the  year 2002 PC game, &#8220;Battlefield 1942&#8243; (邦題, Battlefield 1942), this is  pushing the field to eight years, FPS has grown now Onrainmaruchipurei  popular brands. Bad Company currently has  two other, the browser games &#8220;Battlefield Heroes&#8221;, was designed to  cater to beginners, &#8220;Battlefield 1943&#8243; (PlayStation 3/Xbox 360. PC  version is due out later this year 2010), including several vector has been divided into  development.<br />
Aside while &#8220;quietly  appeared&#8221; that the sentiments and personal perspective, however,  Electronic Arts was the 2002 Speaking of FPS, &#8220;Medal of Honor: Allied  Assault&#8221; were still a big hit. Sometimes it is the same  theme of the Second World War, such as magazine advertisements across  the &#8220;Medal of Honor online and excitement,&#8221; the connotation was  remembered. Also increases the PC  specifications are required, EA did not seek to optimize rather than  particular, the theory that there would and did not really care. Popular Battlefield 1943,  but its spread through the atmosphere were a number of communities on  the net.</p>
<p>And pick up in 2008,  &#8220;Battlefield: Bad Company&#8221; (PlayStation 3/Xbox 360), compared to the  previous Battlefield series, put the rubber has emerged as the single  player works. Work is transferred to  the target PC from the consumer market, was released in November 2005  &#8220;Battlefield 2: Modern Combat&#8221; (PlayStation 2/Xbox. Later ported to Xbox  360, etc.) that will be the successor of his. Battlefield 2: Modern  Combat is a clean hit, the developer Digital Illusions (at the time.  Current EA DICE) is one of the bullet in the market for a consumer  machine, and PlayStation 2 and Xbox hardware constraints in Dekinakatsu that Ta, They should have  increased his determination to do it in next-generation capabilities  dramatically.</p>
<p>They Battlefield: Bad  Company for scratch game engine, &#8220;Frostbite&#8221; is, PlayStation 3 and Xbox  360 is tuned to, and only those multi-core, single-core mainstream was a  little before the PC would be very You can always also be  associated (see story).</p>
<p>Bad Company announced the  development of the two in early 2009, troops out of the familiar Hami  album, &#8220;Bad Company&#8221; our side, because of self-interest, action-packed  story that will be to harness the power of American military power once  again it.</p>
<p>This announcement is also  available from the first version of PC, PC gamers heightened  expectations. Promotions are not pushed  in front of the previous work as a single player, in March, for example  2009 Game Developers Conference (GDC) and presented in the media for  that year was held in Cologne in January 8 and exhibits single Gamescom story of the play is  rarely the center of the multiplayer appeal. Specifically, &#8220;was burned  kneading map,&#8221; &#8220;extensive customization features of the soldiers,&#8221;  &#8220;advanced graphics that can destroy many objects&#8221;, and &#8220;assorted large  variety of weapons,&#8221; but such a strong traditional Battlefield Series It reminds me of the  promotion had been.</p>
<p>Avoided the single player  story is scheduled to be released in late 2009 was &#8220;Modern Warfare Call  of Duty 2&#8243; (PC / PlayStation 3/Xbox 360) I guess it was not aware of  conflicts with Some, anyway, PC as a  version of &#8220;Battlefield 2142&#8243; (2006) since this is one of about four  years.</p>
<p>Introduced a new game  mode &#8220;Rush&#8221; is</p>
<p>So, where β is presently  testing the PC version (Japan time tomorrow will end February 25 days)  to introduce you say a little bit of the atmosphere patterns. Most, Battlefield as it  is also the official blog of the series, EA DICE β version of the  PlayStation 3 after the test, as many as 130 have been released List of  Fixes stretched to the item, quibble over the balance of arms and  weapons at this stage that would be premature. In addition, β are  adjusted so that each patch to a bug found during testing, well, feeling  that this is Toriaezu impression. You know it, you lose too  much to write or write reviews.</p>
<p>β maps of the test was  covered in snow and ice &#8220;Port Valdez&#8221;. Russian troops to attack  oil pipelines in Alaska, such as setting it to protect U.S. forces, the  rules of the game, Battlefield Speaking of which! The &#8220;Conquest&#8221; (war  prisoner&#8217;s base), rather than the introduction of a new &#8220;Rush&#8221; has  become.<br />
This previous work  Battlefield: Bad Company in &#8220;Gold Rush&#8221; mode, but has emerged as, PC  gamers are introduced for the first time. However, there are some  titles that employ similar rules as discussed later, if people used to  multiplayer FPS, so you can understand immediately.</p>
<p>The players are divided  into offense and defense, was placed on the map &#8220;M-COM STATION&#8221; object  called a fight. Russian troops in the  M-COM STATION attack aims to destroy, once the pipeline break in all  this 木Tsu端微塵 teach him. Of course, the U.S.  military to stop the defensive side of it, once we have exhausted the  Risuponchiketto fixed number of Russian troops advance, the defense will  win.<br />
Of A and B, with two  M-COM STATION, a suicide bomber after a period of time that you turn on  the timer is approaching, it is possible to cancel the timer defensive. Sonance a siren to put on  a timer, everyone will know where the defensive players. Therefore, to put a timer  in the first battle, the struggle for lifting occurs.<br />
Bad luck (good luck for  the attacker) is destroyed together with the two in the back of the  front two U.S. Army M-COM STATION become a new active, but that the next  goal for these Russian troops . Rapidly moving to the  back of the front to the back way, the point will change as the game  progresses to the point of the battle, will also vary as it can use  large weapons. 4 Port Valdez will repeat  this a couple times.</p>
<p>This per that, February  12, so the movie right to the point are summarized in the articles  posted on the Sun, (but English) I think that&#8217;s badly helpful. Incidentally, the movie  is that M-COM STATION can also be a blow to every building, in fact I  have never seen play. Iya, I did not know! Let&#8217;s try it now.</p>
<p>Now, rush over to the  Conquest is easy to focus on a fixed location where players can enjoy  the benefits that large-scale battle in the atmosphere of the small  number of participants. If the conquest, the  control points and goal (base) is widely distributed in the map, yet  &#8220;the order to be occupied,&#8221; so as not particularly well, and no  reasonable person, it&#8217;s hard to exist as a game. Wide 出会Ezu to miss the  enemy on the battlefield had been bored from beginning to end. And even that happens.<br />
Maximum PC version of the  32 players who participated, PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 version has 24 more  people for, PC version of the previous work compared to 64 people, uh,  are you half?</p>
<p>The downside is, there is  much of the pattern of play Noshi Yasu. I have also decided to go  places and do things the enemy side, expand or accidental, or it is not  difficult to take an unexpected strategy. Both A and B or M-COM  STATION to go ahead, despite such differences, be likely to repeat the  same thing as a whole. Therefore personal skills  also help out in the table means the difference between FPS skills, if a  few experienced soldiers in himself, or sometimes simply unexpectedly  wins.<br />
For many players gather  in one place, but it is also prone to lag issues in general, to the  extent that the play is not actually encountered quite so bad, I think  it&#8217;s excellent network code. Yappa, I entered the  Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Harmonious balance  between action and strategy is</p>
<p>A similar system adopted  by Rush, &#8220;Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory&#8221; (2003 years) and its successor,  the work &#8220;Enemy Territory Quake Wars&#8221; (2007) is famous. Maximum number of players  participating in Enemy Territory Quake Wars, Bad Company 2 is less than  24 and who can defeat the enemy from the Objective (goal) is the main  achievement. And around here can not  understand the point of only low hourly earn spots, no matter who&#8217;s me.<br />
In addition, THQ&#8217;s  &#8220;Frontline: Fuel of War&#8221; (2008) also aim to clear every front (Front  Line) and moves through the system of the game, Enemy Territory, but was  more easily complex in its own way. &#8220;Unreal Tournament 3&#8243;  (2007) represented by &#8220;other sports FPS&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of the opposite of a  work group.</p>
<p>It is deplorable that not  one can also unlock, unlock weapons list</p>
<p>The rules are complex,  often learn a lot (some of it is fun again) compared to the Enemy  Territory Quake Wars, 2 rush of Bad Company is much easier. M-COM STATION only goal,  is like no other sub-goals. As you move the front,  but personally I can not remember where to get a little subtle changes  that can use large weapons, it should be easy to learn if the average  person.</p>
<p>M-COM STATION secretly  tension and set the timer when approaching and flashy attacks by weapons  such as large tanks and combat helicopters, better balance of strategy  and shoot-out, flexible tempo. Yawa troops if the  opponent was, and earn points, but so much Uhauha slowed way out and hit  the opponent, and was pushed quickly, but also fun to step back from  the base or first 動Kenakatsu.<br />
The retail version is  expected to be implemented Konkuesutomodo, the other four squads to  fight each other set of people &#8220;Squad Deathmatch&#8221; and become infantry  fighting, but the main rule according to Rush &#8220;Squad Rush&#8221; a total of  four types The game mode is planned,  but I do not know details Imaichi, I expect these new game modes.<br />
However, the rules  derived from patterned knew I existed, to some extent already &#8220;winning  pattern&#8221; impression that there is still being maintained. Well, this will happen,  but any game.</p>
<p>Game engine that can  destroy many objects</p>
<p>Frostbite1.5 graphics are  drawn in the high level as you can see from the screenshots, PC  Therefore it is required to improve the spec.<br />
Also interesting features  that can destroy many objects will exert an overwhelming influence  large-scale weapons such as tanks and combat helicopters. However, his tank is like  a traditional &#8220;one can not break through a wall plate,&#8221; but that is no  longer what is weak, the obstacles set up by the convenience of the game  is not over, not destroyed. Percent in the objects  around the map and these can not be completely destroyed, &#8220;and destroyed  everything, flat map can be secondary residence&#8221; They say it is not on.</p>
<p>However, every building  blown dead if I was okay and if you hide here, which is really  refreshing experience. Multiplayer FPS in the  future, the move on these objects was probably destroyed. Downpour, it is hard.<br />
This is also a play that,  where there is reason to rush mode to move more and more united front,  as if flying freely in the Conquest battle tanks and aircraft, one end  of the burned surface , and that might be. When I&#8217;m jealous.<br />
Anyway, Frostbite is used  in the PC is the first time, many people have attention from socchi.</p>
<p>Official blog, PC version  has mentioned about the graphics, the PC version Frostbite1.5 said it  is basically, DirectX 10, and that has been developed as a target. There are many more who  still use Window XP&#8217;s, DirectX 9 is &#8220;Atodzuke&#8221; Ppoku has been  implemented, further, if you are using a compatible graphics card,  DirectX 11 features are used. Additionally, AMD  announced a new technology &#8220;ATI Eyefinity&#8221; (story) and also supported,  and that several high-resolution display that supports a single graphics  card.<br />
Nevertheless, this per  the latest PC games will be difficult to produce. Has three types of  current PC graphics API, and mixed, and its development into view and  even consumer machines will be up very troublesome. PC version of EA DICE  have released me, it&#8217;ll secretly want gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Battlefield 2&#8243; (2005)  represented by the PC Battlefield series for comparison, and reduction  in the number of participants &#8220;squad / commander system&#8221; and simplified,  Bad Company may look like that when you look back 2 However, this is still  undoubtedly the world of Battlefield. Chaotic battlefield, you  can enjoy a fierce battle friends and enemies into disarray, the rule  was simple, OK, Itcho anymore! And enhance toxic.<br />
β the start of the test  and about three weeks, but rather, the battlefield is the number of  people have already filled with high-level soldiers unlocked items, we  Kimi, you better be good or a little more work or study , and is about to say and  feel, and has the charm of this game is no doubt that&#8217;s it. Want to wait to enjoy  the release.﻿</p>
