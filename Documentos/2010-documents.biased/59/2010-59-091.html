<h3>1995-1997</h3>
<p>
<strong>1995</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Larry Page and Sergey Brin meet at Stanford. (Larry, 22, a U Michigan grad, is considering the school; Sergey, 21, is assigned to show him around.) According to some accounts, they disagree about most everything during this first meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>1996</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Larry and Sergey, now Stanford computer science grad students, begin collaborating on a search engine called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19971210065425/backrub.stanford.edu/backrub.html">BackRub</a>.</span>
</li>
<li>BackRub operates on Stanford servers for more than a year -- eventually taking up too much bandwidth to suit the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>1997</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Larry and Sergey decide that the BackRub search engine needs a new name. After some brainstorming, they go with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990125084553/alpha.google.com/">Google</a> -- a play on the word "googol," a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. The use of the term reflects their mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web.</li>
</ul>
<a name="2"></a>

<h3>1998</h3>
<p>
<strong>August</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim writes <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/09/dayintech_0907">a check for $100,000</a> to an entity that doesn't exist yet: a company called Google Inc.</li>

<li>Google <a href="http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2119530">files for incorporation</a> in California on September 4. Shortly thereafter, Larry and Sergey open a bank account in the newly-established company's name and deposit Andy Bechtolsheim's check.</li>
<li>Larry and Sergey hire <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991002122809/www-cs-students.stanford.edu/%7Ecsilvers/">Craig Silverstein</a> as their first employee; he's a fellow computer science grad student at Stanford.</li>

<p>
<strong>December</strong>
