<h2>Timeline from the Cornell Department of Computer Science</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Events/40years/">40th Anniversary Symposium</a>, October 1, 2005</h3>

<h4>Before Computer Science.</h4>
<p><a href="Conway.html">Dick Conway</a> and Bill Maxwell of Industrial Eng. develop CORC on 
the Burroughs B-220 and Control Data 1604 to provide a simpler language than Fortran or Algol. 
CORC can be described on a single page. CORC is taught beginning in Fall 1962.</p>

<h4>1965. <span class="who">CS starts with faculty Dick Conway, Pat Fischer, Juris Hartmanis (Chair), Chris Pottle, Gerry Salton, Sid Saltzman, Bob Walker.</span></h4>
<p>The Computer Science Department is formed. (Conway spent his later years in the 
Cornell School of Management and is retired, and Salton passed away in 1995.) 
Housed in both Engineering and Arts & Sciences, CS starts with an MS/PhD program.</p>
<p>Gerry Salton brings his SMART system, started in 1961 at Harvard. SMART is his main tool for 35 years of experimental research in information retrieval.</p>
<p>Juris Hartmanis publishes the paper that starts the field of computational complexity, with
Dick Stearns: <cite>On the computational complexity of algorithms, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.</cite> 117 (1965), 285-306. 
Later, they receive the ACM Turing Award for this work.</p>
<p>CS produces its first PhD, Joel Sturman, a transfer from Electrical Engineering.</p>

<h4>1966. <span class="who">Ken Brown, Peter Wegner join.</span></h4>
<p>Juris Hartmanis and Dick Stearns publish the first of many influential texts by CS:
