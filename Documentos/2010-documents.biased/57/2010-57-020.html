      <h4>The introduction ...</h4>
      <h1>After two high-end DDR3 RAM reviews it is again time for an inexpensive 4GB PC3-10600 CL9 kit.<br>
        The Crucial PC3-10600 4GB CL9 kit  comes without heat spreader and is designed for a voltage of 1.5 V.<br>
        With this  low Vmem no OC records were reached, but the result are nevertheless respectable.<br>
        All OC results and more details about the Crucial PC3-10600 4GB kit are shown in the new ocinside.de test report.</h1>

      <h1>The memory modules are delivered without heat spreader (heatsinks), so it is necessary to keep an eye on the RAM temperature during higher overclocking.<br>
        Alternatively one can mount a passive or active memory cooler, which are available in different versions e.g. at our sponsors <a href="http://www.ocinside.de/cgi-bin/count.cgi?http://www.oc-card.de" target="_blank">OC-Card.de</a> or <a href="http://www.ocinside.de/cgi-bin/count.cgi?http://www.pc-cooling.de/" target="_blank">PC-Cooling.de</a>.<br>
        Crucial by the way grants lifelong warranty (Limited Lifetime Warranty) for the buyer.  
        All information to manufacturer conditions are of course without guarantee by ocinside.de.<br>
        Officially these Crucial modules are designed for the JEDEC standard voltage of 1.50 V for DDR3 modules.<br>
        The manufacturer timings and latency can be easily reached on this voltage.<br>
        By the way, the test modules were equipped with <a href="../workshop/memory_product_id.html" target="_blank">Micron D9JNM</a> chips, whereby the assembly can vary however within production.</h1>
      <h1>Here is a picture of the  other Crucial modules side:</h1>

      <h4>Not  4GB during booting, but only  3GB in the BIOS or operating system ...</h4>
      <h1>It can occur that the memory capacity is only indicated as approx. 3GB instead of the 4GB,
        because the 4GB DDR, DDR2 or DDR3 RAM size or any size with more than 2GB is still a case sui generis.<br>
        <a href="../workshop/less_memory.html" target="_blank">Here at ocinside.de</a> is a guide which contains among other things a table, how much RAM is supported by operating systems.</h1>
      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <h4 align="left">Benchmark values and test results ...</h4>
      <h1>Let us  continue with the most important part of the test report,  the highest possible stable performance.<br>
        The test results are based on an ASRock M3A790GXH/128M motherboard with an <a href="http://www.ocinside.de/html/workshop/amd_phenom_product_id.html?cpu=HDX710WFK3DGI" target="_blank">AMD Phenom II 710 X3  CPU</a> on different frequencies depending on the reference clock for the different memory benchmarks.<br>
        The multiplier adjustment remains on 13x with all frequencies, because an adjustment for the CPU in half multiplier<br>
        steps would be too inaccurate to get nearly the same CPU frequency for all tests.<br>
        Microsoft Windows 7 RC Ultimate Edition is used as the operating system.<br>
        The stability was examined with the software <a href="../links/ocsoft_links.html" target="_blank">Memtest86</a> 
        and <a href="../links/ocsoft_links.html" target="_blank">SiSoft Sandra Lite 2009 SP3</a> program is used for all<br>
        benchmarks, since it offers extensive adjustments and a fast result comparison.<br>
        BTW. the latest SiSoft Sandra 2009 version is <a href="../links/ocsoft_links.html" target="_blank"> available on our download server</a> and can be downloaded much faster.<br>
        All benchmarks are also included in the free Sandra Lite version.</h1>
      <h1>First the maximum possible frequency of the memory module was determined with default 1.50 Volt (1,53V).<br>
        The memory frequency was increased in small steps with a fixed memory timing of 8-8-8-24 2T and default memory voltage, as long as the detailed memory test with Memtest86 runs without any errors.<br>
        This quite long testing time ensured that this frequency works really stable with these modules.</h1>
      <h1>The highest possible frequency with 8-8-8-24 2T (CAS-TRCD-TRP-TRAS) timings and 1.53V was 750 / 1499 MHz.<br>
        If you've read  both previous highend DDR3 module reviews, you already know such a frequency result, because on this low voltage the frequency  was identical to the much faster modules.</h1>
      <h1>Here is a Snipping screenshot of CPU-Z with 750 / 1499 MHz and 8-8-8-24 2T with 1,53 Volt:</h1>
      <h1 align="center"><img src="../../assets/memory/crucial_4gb_pc3_10600_ddr3_1499_cl8.gif" width="390" height="438"></h1>
      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <h1>Of course it's possible to run much higher frequencies with increased voltages or lower timings,<br>
        because the frequency values and timings depends directly from each other.<br>
        But officially Crucial specify only a  voltage of 1.50 Volt without loosing the  warranty.<br>
        The voltage should not be increased very much without further cooling modifications.</h1>
      <h1>The benchmark comparison of all DDR3  memory modules were tested with the default 1.53 V, where these Crucial 4GB modules reached 1499 MHz.<br>
        This highest possible clocking on  the default DDR3 voltage  was compared now with two other settings.<br>
        On the one hand they were tested with 200 MHz reference clock x6,66 = 1333 MHz and  SPD values<br>
        (SPD values are programmed in the SPD IC by the manufacturer).<br>
        On the other hand the highest possible frequency with the permitted manufacturers voltage was determined at 8-8-8-24 2T. 
        But in case of these modules the highest voltage is identical with the lowest test voltage, so the second test is equal to the first result.</h1>
      <h1>With a frequency of approx. 667 MHz the timings by SPD EEPROM autodetection were 9-12-12-30 2T (CAS-TRCD-TRP-TRAS).</h1>
      <h1>Here is a Snipping screenshot of CPU-Z with 666.7 / 1333 MHz and 9-12-12-30 2T:</h1>

      <h1><img src="../../assets/memory/memory_compare.gif" width="740" height="630"></h1>
      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <h1>The Crucial PC3-10600 CL9 kit achieved identical overclocking results with JEDEC standard voltage of 1.50 V as for example the previous tested
        OCZ PC3-12800 CL8 kit on 1,50V or the Lexar Media Crucial Ballistix tracer PC3-10600 CL6 kit.<br>
        At the first look this is very amazing and also very welcome on such a low price.<br>
        However, the other two DDR3 kits are provided with heat spreaders and can be operated with much higher voltages.<br>
         The last one makes it possible to increase the frequency much higher and thus also increase the performance.</h1>
      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <h4 align="left">Result and general impression ...</h4>
      <h1>The Crucial PC3-10600 CL9 4GB RAM kit (1x CT2KIT25664BA1339 or 2x CT25664BA1339) have amazing high overclocking results and can compete on low Vmem with two high-end DDR3 kits.<br>
        But the memory voltage of the DDR3-1333 modules can not further increased according to manufacturer information.<br>
        At this point separate the wheat from the chaff in comparison to more expensive high-end modules, since these are provided with passive or active heat spreaders and allows an increasement of the important Vmem.<br>
        If a voltage increasement is out of the question anyhow, one can make a good deal with this kit, because it  achieves high frequencies and fast latencies on a low memory voltage.<br>
        All in all this kit is not only interesting for OEM systems, but also for overclocking beginners.</h1>
