In your Cinebench test of the MacBook white, you found a high OpenGL Software score for the MacBook in the Cinebench test, that perhaps is due to changes in the operating system. For me, even stranger is the higher OpenGL hardware score if compared to the Mini performance: both have the same graphics card, so what does it mean? Badly programmed drivers?

Your CineBench figures for the MacBook Pro were obviously taken from early tests.  Since those earliest benchmarks the CineBench application was changed to provide corrected figures for the Open GL tests.  Here are the results from the current version of CineBench for a MacBook Pro 2.0 Ghz model:

<p>Open GL SW - 1349<br>
Open GL HW - 2617
<p class="qed">
[Publishing a different benchmark with the same version number (9.5) seems like a really bad idea.  We tried to download the April version yesterday, but it didn't expand successfully.  All our tests are with the February version. -MacInTouch]

As a comparison to your 2GHz MacBook Cinebench benchmark, here is the same 
    test run on a 2GHz MacBook *Pro* with OSX 10.4.6 and all the latest 
    firmware updates.

    <p>Single CPU Render: 305<br>Multi-CPU Render: 565<br>Speedup: 1.85x
    </p>
    <p>Shading: 351<br>OPEN-GL Software: 1337<br>OPEN-GL Hardware: 2591<br>
      OPEN-GL Speedup: 7.38x
    </p>
    <p>CoreDuoTemp reads CPU Temperature at 81 deg. C during the test, and the 
      top left of the case behind the Esc key gets too hot to touch. After 
      sitting ten mintutes this has dropped to 58 deg. C. Do the MacBooks run 
      cooler?
    </p>
    <p>Compared to the &quot;Pro&quot; models The MacBook looks very competitive in terms 
      of speed, both processor and graphics.<br>

I have noticed on my black MacBook 2GHz that when I pull the battery out the CPU is throttled back to 1GHz and stays there until the battery is replaced.  Verified with 'sysctl kern.cpu_currentfreq' from a terminal.

<p>This is very silly considering I am pulling the battery because the machine is sitting on a desk and would be storing the battery with a 50% charge on a shelf, you know, exactly like how apple recommends you do to maximize your laptop's battery life and have always done without such a penalty.<br>

Perhaps the CPU down speeds to 1 ghz without the battery, because the MacBooks' power block is rated at 65W and the MacBook Pro block is rated at 85W.

<p>Perhaps an Apple Store visit and a floor model demo Power block swap between MacBook and MacBook Pro would show otherwise.  Unless one of your readers is a real Apple aficionado and already owns both. (getting three soon--smile)

ALL Macbooks sold at the Apple Stores I went to had upgraded ram at 1GB. 
    The store did not have ANY stock-configured systems at 512MB. So, when you 
    go and compare systems in the store, be aware that Apple is tricking you 
    into thinking that the speed of the demo is what your stock is going to 
    be! <br><br>Of course, the Apple store associates had no idea, didn't want 
    to help provide a demo with 512MB and were generally, as always, not 
    knowledgeable about the Powerbook 12&quot; or Macbook. Please, do your own 
    research before going to the store! And remember that the machine in the 
    store is going to be quicker than the machine you're actually buying!<br>

With regard to the MacInTouch Reader who noticed the Macbook 2 Ghz 
    throttles down to 1 Ghz when the battery isn't in and the computer is 
    plugged in, my comment is: Maybe Apple wants to sell more batteries! After 
    all, the behavior described here would force more cycling, since you 
    wouldn't want to use the computer if it weren't plugged in... Just a joke, 
    or not...Is there some way of maybe using Dev Tools and CHUD to change 
    this situation? Or perhaps an NVRAM or kext hack? I bet someone could come 
    up with one. Or is there some good reason (hardware-wise) why Apple made 
    the computer this way?<br>

Re: the battery/CPU throttling observation, is this reader saying that the Processor Performance setting in the Energy Saver prefpane is being ignored? Might it have been on "Automatic" and not "Highest"?<br>

I was the original poster of the observation that the cpu was being limited to 1GHz with the battery removed... after a weekend of diagnosis I finally nailed it down to an odd result of the increw's SpeedIt kernel extension which CoreDuoTemp uses to read the CPU speed.

<p>Initially it didn't seem like CoreDuoTemp as I had quit that and was using Temperature Monitor to read the CPU temp but a Safe Boot verified it was something in 3rd party software and since Temperature Monitor stopped reading the CPU temp the lightbulb went off and that was the culprit.

<p>For the Reader who suggested checking the Processor Performance tab of Energy Saver System Preference that was the first place I checked... except there's zero options for CPU control there at all, which makes sense as Intel's SpeedStep technology which throttles the CPU speed is implemented in hardware, not in Apple's Software.

<p>For the other reader who incorrectly supposed it was due to the power adaptor they cited the MacBook's power adaptor as 65W which is the 15" MacBook Pro's rating, the MacBooks power adaptor is rated at 55W.<br>

[Re: Apple Store computers having extra RAM installed]
<p>Sorry to hear that your experience with the Mac Specialists has been bad. I tend to have very helpful, knowledgeable staff to help me out at the various 5 local stores I often visit. I'd say 90% of the time they are very knowledgeable. As far as the extra RAM on the demo machines go, why would Apple put more in than stock config? Could it be that random customers tend to open up dozens of apps all running at the same time? Any CPU would need at least a GIG to keep up with that kind of punishment. Of course if you close all apps and run just a simple Word doc or email or iLife app, any amount of RAM from 512 to 1GB would be sufficient. Speed from an extra 512 would only matter for more multitasking. So 'quicker' demo machines is relatively subjective.

I'm very happy with the performance of Windows XP on my Black Macbook (upgraded to 2GB ram). I loaded both Boot Camp and Parallels and performance with Parallels is so good that I'm considering removing Boot Camp to reclaim the hard disk size.

<p>I'm not a heavy duty Windows user. I primarily wanted to run XP in order to use Tivo to Go and my SlingBox. Both work well with acceptable audio and video performance under Win XP running in Parallels.<br>

I can confirm that contrary to rumors, Final Cut Pro 5.1 (intel version) works terrific on the Macbook. I'm running 1 gig of ram on a black Macbook and the performance in the Pro applications is on par with my G5 desktop machine. HDV video (very huge data through-put as it is near High Definition) encoded without any delay and I was able to do several real-time effects in the timeline. Livetype also worked very well as did After Effects 6.5

<p>Overall, a terrfic little production machine for video/audio.

I had a 17&quot; PowerBook (1.67Ghz) and before that a 15&quot; PowerBook. I loved 
    them both but found them slow, obviously, to my 2.5 Dual G5 desktop. So I 
    was using it less and less.

    <p>I do a lot of Java Server Type development and was really impressed with 
      the specs on the new MacBook.
    </p>
    <p>I wavered between the 13&quot; MacBook and the two Pro Models (15&quot;/17&quot;). 
      While I loved the 17&quot;, with the large screen and it's relatively light 
      compact design, 17&quot; is a lot of area to just pickup and go. Or better 
      yet, get up out of the lazyboy, when the Mrs. is calling.
    </p>
    <p>See I decided on the Black MacBook with 2Gig RAM. And I'm REALLY 
      impressed. A good indication of the speed, in my world, is the time it 
      takes to start an instance of our application server.
    </p>
    <p>Solaris V440 = 49 secs<br>Solaris AMD = 29 secs<br>G5 Quad Core = 31 secs<br>

Re: your recent Notes and Tips looking at mis-matched memory for the MB.  One point that has been mentioned previously is that with 512M, the video-allocated memory may be somewhat squashed and the graphics would suffer - but this might be alleviated somewhat by having more memory.  Your Cinebench software rendering results, being lower for the mis-matched memory MB, indicates either this is not the case or that the effects of mis-matching is even more pronounced than what is first apparent in the graph.<br>

Obviously running significant apps under Rosetta will affect both 
      overall CPU load and perceived app performance. But it occurs to me to 
      wonder if this also affects MEMORY requirements. If you compare some 
      significant app running under Rosetta with the same app &quot;native&quot;, doing 
      the same workload, are the memory requirements similar or different? 
      MAYBE we'll find that 512 MB or 1 GB works a lot better when everything 
      is native than we do today - or maybe Rosetta isn't much of a factor.

As I bought my black MacBook primarily as a Photoshop box, I was interested in how it's performance stacked up.  A local photo forum I hang out on recently posted an easy benchmark test for Photoshop. The benchmark involved resizing a full-color image to 2000 pixels wide In any version of Photoshop, then select Filter&gt;Blur&gt;Radial Blur, and choose 100% and BEST for Quality settings. Use Spin, not Zoom, find a stop watch, or watch or clock with a second hand, and clock the time it takes to apply the filter

<p>Results:

<p>My Dual Processor Desktop 2 GHz G5:  29 seconds (with Safari open)<br>
My MacBook Core Duo 2 Ghz (512 Meg RAM) running natively Win XP and Windows version PS CS: 27.7 seconds<br>
My MacBook Core Duo 2 Ghz  (512 Meg RAM) running OSX PS CS2 under emulation with Rosetta: 38 seconds

<p>From the forum posting where I found this here are some other computer performances from other forum members running this same test on the same image:

<p>3.3 GHz Pentium 4 laptop: 42 seconds<br>
3,2 GHz Pentium 4 with 1.5 Gig RAM: 40 seconds<br>
3 Ghz P4 2 GB ram: 42 seconds<br>
Dual Xeon 3.0 Ghz 2 Gig RAM: 35 seconds<br>
3.2 GHz P4 4 Gig RAM: 44 seconds<br>
Pentium D 3.0 GHz Dual Core 2 GB: 28 seconds<br>
2 Ghz Pentium M 1 Gig RAM: 75 seconds

<p>I must say that I was very impressed with the little MacBook in this benchmarking test. I imagine when I get 2Gb RAM installed in it, it will be even faster.

Hey all - if you hadn't already seen the test results for MacBooks running 
    Final Cut Pro, they are viewable here:

    <p><a href="http://www.creativemac.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=43717&afterinter=true">
CreativeMac test results</a>
    </p>
    <p>....where the MacBook held its own and actually beat the more expensive 
      PCIe based (newest) Dual 2.0 GHz G5s on many tests in Motion, Final Cut 
      Pro, and Compressor.
    </p>
    <p>....and I've commented on the tests and results here:

MacBook ties or beats Dual G5 in Final Cut Studio 5.1 testing</a>
    </p>
    <p>The interesting question then becomes this:
    </p>
    <p>If MacBooks are at least as fast as a dual 2.0 GHz G5, then WHY are they 
      not officially supported?
    </p>
    <p>I've come up with four theories on this that I've posted <a href="http://www.hdforindies.com/2006/05/theory-time-why-is-final-cut-studio.html">
here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>They break down to:<br>1.) Apple is right, it doesn't work.<br>2.) Not 
      all features work, therefore the whole thing isn't supported<br>3.) 
      Future proofing for next Final Cut upgrade, and<br>4.) Market 
      Segmentation (sell more expensive boxes)
    </p>

I finally took a look at the new MacBooks this weekend at the local Apple 
    Store, and was so impressed with the basic 1.83GHz white model that I 
    bought one. <br><br>Coming from a 15&quot; PowerBook (PB) G4, I was debating 
    between the 15&quot; and 17&quot; MacBook pro (MBP) models. I do a fair amount of 
    software development and CAD work, so screen quality and graphics 
    performance are important. But I have not been thrilled with the 
    durability of the aluminum case of the PB/MBP, and find the design to be 
    getting a bit outdated (this was especially apparent when I compared the 
    MacBook and MBP side by side -- all of a sudden that &quot;pro&quot; aluminum case 
    looks like it's styled after a 1950s appliance). I think the MacBooks look 
    great, I like the rugged design and durability of the white case, and the 
    price of the base model is fantastic. <br><br>The MacBook has almost all 
    the features of my 15&quot; PB G4 (FW800 and modem are the notable 
    differences), but with far better performance, for almost half that 
    original cost. Really a very good value in the overall scheme of things 
    looking at Apple's laptop lineup over the years. For an entry level model 
    it's quite good.<br><br>My main reservations looking at the MacBook 
    centered on the screen and graphics performance (keyboard was a 
    non-issue). Surprisingly, I actually found the shiny screen to be better 
    for CAD type work -- stuff just looks more vivid and crystal clear. And 
    the graphics performance is completely adequate, but I need to explain 
    what I mean by that. I brought some CAD software and 3D models with me on 
    a memory stick, and ran on both the base MacBook and the 17&quot; MBP. With a 
    small 3D model, the 17&quot; MBP easily trounced the MacBook when it came to 
    rotating, zooming, and translating shaded 3D objects. Where the MacBook 
    showed choppy performance similar to my PB G4 (which also has 64MB VRAM), 
    the MBP was in a different league with very smooth motion and no 
    stuttering. Step up to a large 3D model, however, and the gap pretty much 
    goes away. On both machines, I needed to enable the &quot;sparse&quot; wireframe 
    graphics mode of the CAD software when doing movement on the screen to get 
    suitable performance (with sparse mode, the shaded surface temporarily 
    becomes a wireframe when you move it, and the graphics overhead is reduced 
    substantially). <br><br>So when the 3D model is complicated enough to even 
    tax the MBP and its mighty 256MB dedicated graphics system, sparse mode is 
    pretty much a requirement, in which case the real-world performance is no 
    better than the base MacBook. I thought that was a pretty interesting 
    discovery, and it certainly narrowed the gap between the MacBook and the 
    higher priced pro models for me.<br>

I just bought my girlfriend a 2.0 ghz white MacBook and decided to stick with the 512MB RAM knowing that it would be cheaper to upgrade from a third party.

<p>I have to be honest, 512MB of RAM SUCKS! That is really the only way to describe it. 

<p>Overall, the MacBook is a very quick little machine, and I have been very happy with it, but once you exceed 512 of RAM and it starts swapping pages, the thing hits a wall and becomes completely unresponsive. And it seems like you don't have to do very much for that to happen. For example, if I open iTunes (I have over 10,000 songs in my library) or iPhoto (only 500 photos at the moment), the thing comes to a crawl. Or even running a bunch of Dashboard widgets.

<p>I am about to order 2GB of RAM for it, but I am a bit dissappinted that it doesn't gracefully slow down or something, it becomes totally unresponsive. I would be a very angry person if I didn't know how to fix it.<br>

<p>There's no way to gracefully slow down without artificially and prematurely slowing down and I can't imagine any user being happy about that. The problem we run into is that RAM is 6 orders of magnitude faster than a hard drive. Not half the speed. Not a tenth or a hundredth. It's on the order of one millionth.<br>

I am running Windows XP Pro under Parallels on a MacBook 2.0 with 2 GB of memory.  The performance of the MacBook is very impressive.  XP under Parallels boots and shuts down much faster than my Athlon 4800+ based PC.  I can run Goggle Earth in OpenGL mode under XP.  720p trailers are playable (I have yet to try a 1080p trailer in XP under Parallels).  

<p>The MacBook itself boots faster than my Dual 2.7.  When playing a 1080p trailer under Mac OS X on both the G5 and the MacBook the cooling fans on the G5 kick in noticeably but the MacBook remains quiet.  Application launch time is noticeably faster on the MacBook and I don't see the spinning beach ball as much (hardly at all).   That is impressive considering the G5 has 7200rpm drives and the MacBook has a 5400rpm drive.

<p>Moving to Intel was the right thing to do.

O.K., I'll admit it: I was really down on the idea of Intel-based Macs.  That is, until I bought a MacBook this weekend to replace both my iBook G4 and a Dell PC laptop.  

<p>I'm in love.  I kitted it with 2G of RAM and have a 100G 7200RPM drive on order.  Parallels Desktop works like a charm, and now I have the best of both worlds.  (I prefer MacOS, but have to solve the occasional Windows problem for my users.)  This thing screams - it seems almost as fast as my dual G5.

<p>What amazed me is that I prefered it over the MB Pro, as did my spousal unit (she has a TiBook).  I really think Apple has hit an ideal form factor with it.  It's small, rugged, and fast.  Did I mention that it's fast?  I'll admit I was wrong.  Apple hit a home run with this puppy.<br>

I put off purchasing a MacBook for a time because I had heard about how slowly the Adobe applications were going to work.  But finally I went ahead. I am not a professional user of Photoshop, but I take a lot  of photographs in RAW format, manipulate old pictures, and generally make more than fair use of the application...as I do of Illustrator 10.3 and Photoshop Elements 4.0.  I was surprised to find how well everything functions.  In fact I do not see a significant hit...my impression is that these applications work as well on my 2GHZ MacBook with 2G of RAM as on my 20" G5 iMac with the same setup.  Incidentally, I was also happy to be able to extract PhotoBooth from the MacBook installation disks with Pacifist and to install it on the iMac, where it works perfectly.  <br>

I have set up 2 (black) MacBooks for clients. They complained after about 
    a week that the MacBooks were substantially slower than their previous Al 
    12&quot; PowerBooks. I upgraded the RAM to 2 GB resulting in absolute screaming 
    performance! I have not seen a Mac boot as fast under Mac OS X as this! 
    Apps launch instantly - Rosetta apps take longer but acceptable. As a 
    first impression the ugrade appears to have a positive effect on the heat 
    issue also. That was a BIG problem - clients could NOT use the MacBooks on 
    their laps, they simply felt like getting burnt! MacBooks are NOT laptops, 
    just sleek, portable desktops. Another plus is that the desktop expands to 
    2 screens, not mirror mode and Airport works with great signal strength. 
    If only the heat problem went away!<br>

I have facilitated several upgrades from G3 iBooks to the new MacBooks. The overwhelming critisism coming back from users is: "The new MacBook is awfully slow!" or " My iBook was heaps faster.."!

<p>These statements are representative and I can second these opinions from my 'expert' position. It is clear why: most of these operators use MS Office, which is emulated. Some use Adobe InDesign or Photoshop, which is emulated. Most useres run their MacBooks with 512mb RAM as supplied - this is a big impediment.

<p>The point here is the immediate user impression that the new Mac is worse than the old one! This cannot be good for Apple and nowhere is it mentioned in their advertising (surprise!) that to get reasonable performance a RAM upgrade to at least 2GB is mandatory.
<p class="qed">
[How much RAM do these MacBooks have installed?? -MacInTouch]

<p>512 as supplied from Apple - sure, you and I know that's not enough. However, that's what most 'consumers' will buy and thus they will experience a let-down. IMO Rosetta needs heaps of RAM to run acceptably - this is a very technical issue, beyond normal people's comprehension and Apple shields them from this, fair enough! But the user experience is abysmal and I am waiting for it to backfire for Apple. Now that the platform can be compared properly with The Other (Intel based) OS...

The comparisson of the iBook to a MacBook is curious. The iBook in all its configurations shipped with relatively little RAM (I believe), and if his clients had stock RAM and any applications open, they would find that Microsoft Office runs pretty slowly. I bet they upgraded the RAM on those iBooks. All the iBooks I ever saw were pretty slow.

<p>The RAM issue is as old as personal computers and it's not peculiar to Apple. It's an upsell for better performance. If he let's his clients order stock MacBooks, well, what should they expect? They don't sound like first-time computer users.

<p>MacBooks are do darn cheap, I don't know why anyone would order a stock configuration. I've had great success with my MacBook, running lots of applications, and overall, I'm amazed by the performance of Rosetta. Buying extra RAM online is cheap and installation is very easy.<br>

I have 1GB ram in my new MacBook and find it extremely, irritatingly, slow 
    - and not just running Office. It takes 15-20 seconds to come back to life 
    after sleep and is sluggish doing everything, including Expose. I'm 
    writing this on my 20in iMac and it's markedly snappier.

    <p>I suspect the problem is that I did a migration from my old Powerbook. 
      My plan is to upgrade to 2Gb ram and do a fresh install. Will report 
      back.

I do a small amount of computer support; About half is Macs. One of these folk just bought a new MacBook 1.8 GHz. I set it up over a three day period last week. I have been shocked at how slow this MacBook is. On many task it seems slower than the 700 MHz iMac G4 I transfered files from. It is even sluggish using the iApplications; The finder is slower than my MMD 867. This all while running one or two simple applications.

<p>The MacBook is totally stock and I think it is shameful that Apple ships these without enough RAM to work properly. I don't want to tell this woman that her new Mac needs a couple hundred dollars of RAM to work like one would and should expect it to. Mr. Jobs should try using one of these Macs without upgrades for a couple of months. Even a cheap car runs fine when it's new.

<p>I don't mind the idea that we need to ad RAM to do more advanced tasks on a new Mac. But any new Mac should be able to do email, letter writing and launch simple consumer applications without grunting.<br>

I second Roger Harris' observations on how slow I found Intel Macs with 
    the factory amount of RAM. I have a client using an Intel iMac 1.8GHz and 
    she was pulling her hair out at how slow it was. I was able to improve 
    things for 24 hrs after using Cocktail to wipe VM swap files etc. but the 
    slowness returned the day after. <br><br>It would seem, and I have read 
    others suggesting the same, that the Intel Macs seem to fall back on 
    Virtual Memory far quicker (or perhaps less efficiently?) than Power PC 
    Macs.
<p class="qed">

I just decided to import an audio CD using iTunes on my white MacBook 2.0 with 2 GB RAM. I was using 160 MP3 encoding, and the CD imported at about 5-8x. My girlfriend could import the same CD at about 10x on her iBook 1.33 with 1.25 GB RAM. My PowerBook 1.33 is even faster (although I did not test it on this CD). So I tried other CDs and tried restarting the computer with the same slow results.

<p>Now, I was pretty sure that the MacBook can be faster, so I tried something different: I copied the CD to the hard drive, then encoded it from there. I noticed that the copying process took a LONG time, but the encoding process went very fast: about 35x.

<p>So it seems that the CD drive in the MacBook is much slower than the drive in an iBook or a old G4 PowerBook. This makes sense to me because the CD drive is also a lot quieter.

<p>So here's my question: Does my computer have a bum hard drive or is this just typical of MacBooks?<br>

[Roger Harris] I have been shocked at how slow this MacBook is.
<p>MS Office is known to be slow if only 512M is installed due to Rosetta needing memory to work with bloatware. Other thing is any kernel extensions (/System/Library/Extensions) that you installed (Antivirus) or that the Migration Assistant brought over can bring an Intel to a crawl. Try starting with shift down (Extensions off) and see what speed is like then. Apple, like every other mfr, ships with bare minimum RAM.<br>

I'm planning to buy a MacBook (white) and would like to know in what 
    situations, if any, I would notice a difference between the base 1.83 MHz 
    model and the 2.0 GHz level.

    <p>According to Macworld's tests, the performance difference between the 
      two models did not appear to be 'significant.'<br>However, I'm not 
      familiar with what MW's testing covers.
    </p>
    <p>Am I likely to get lesser performance from the 1.83 GHz model when 
      running music applications like Live, Reason, Logic, etc., or just doing 
      a lot of multitasking? (I plan to max the RAM out to 2.0 GB).
    </p>
    <p>The processor speed difference aside, I don't really think of a 
      DVD-writeable drive as something I necessarily need -- not for the $200 
      premium, anyway.

result is

without battery --- 17:45 needed

    will it run without any problems [on a MacBook]? I would really like to 
    hear from people who have actually have run Final Cut Pro 5.1 on a Macbook 
    and what their experiences were. I know it does not have the ATI Mobilty 
    Radeon X1600 graphics card like the MacBookPro does. So was that an issue

My son has a 2.0 GHz/1 GB RAM MacBook that he has used to make/edit videos using Final Cut Express HD v3.5. His only problem has been the small screen which was resolved by an  external monitor. Of course, if I had sprung for more RAM initially, he'd be happier. He also needed an external hard drive for the clips, etc.

<p>My suggestion would be to get FC Express HD rather than the Pro version The current version does quite a bit, and it is VERY much cheaper.<br>

I run Final Cut Studio 5 just fine on my Macbook (1.83ghz & 2GB RAM). It's not even the Universal Binary version, so it's running in Rosetta. No speed demon, but it's about the same as my old Powerbook G4. Motion may give you a little trouble, but the rest of it works without a hitch.<br>

No, no perfromance loss at all. In the past editing applications not even 
    supported graphic card acceleration. A dual Core 2 Ghz is really really 
    enough for cutting video (having the opportunity doing most of the things

    and edits thousands of pictures. Thanks.<br>

<p>If he is getting page outs to disk now, then the extra RAM will give him 2GB more "overhead." If he is not getting page outs now, then I don't think he'd notice much if any difference. This can be monitored by opening Activity Monitor and clicking on "System Memory" near the bottom of the window while opening some representative projects.<br>

Responding to the query about maxing out a MacBook to 6GB from 4GB:

    <p>Whether or not your user could benefit from the additional RAM is highly 
      dependent on their work habits. I'd suggest you have this user keep a 
      log of their memory usage (from Activity Monitor) at random times of the 
      day for a few days and see how much RAM is being used, especially after 
      a long day of editing photos. If the free RAM dips below 500MB or so, 
      you might have a good case for an upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>And don't worry about losing the potential speed benefits of 
      interleaving when using identical ram chips. It just doesn't work out to 
      be much advantage in the real world:

<p>Overall computer performance- maybe. You might look into upgrading to the new 64bit Snow Leopard to get the full memory usage.<br>
As for CS-3 that's different-- I believe it will only use 4GB of RAM. I'd look at getting the fastest hard drives you can.<br>
