<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurpreet</div><div class="date">06-08-2007, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a mobile office worker your unique needs for a laptop computer mean that what you want in a laptop will differ from those looking for personal use laptops. You want a laptop that you can take with you easily. You need to have the ability to connect to the Internet and company networks in a variety of methods and have a laptop capable of undertaking your daily work tasks. Evaluate the tasks you perform and compare them against the laptop features to ensure you get the right laptop.<br />
<br />
Here are eight important headings, which one must consider to ensure you to get the right laptop.   Headings are explained in detail under the same category in form of new thread.<br />
<br />
#1. Lease or Buy a Laptop<br />
<br />
When making the decision to buy a laptop for mobile use, it's important to consider the options you have available. You can purchase new, used or refurbished or even lease a laptop. Decide what factors are most important and keep in mind what your budget will allow. If state of the art technology is key, then leasing is your best option. Examine your options before you buy a lapop.<br />
<br />
#2. Size and Weight<br />
<br />
The next important criteria when you buy a laptop is size and weight. The best choices for mobile office workers are thin &amp; light laptops and ultra-portable designs. You'll find these laptops offer the best mobility options and make the most sense when you have to travel with your laptop. Laptops meant to replace desktop systems may be too heavy to carry for long periods of time but can provide features valuable to mobile professionals.<br />
<br />
#3. Connectivity<br />
<br />
As a mobile office worker having the ability to connect to an office network and the Internet are integral to successfully working in a mobile environment. Laptops with multiple connection options are what will suit mobile workers and leave them with the ability to get connected in practically any situation. Consider the different types of situations where you will need remote access and make sure that your laptop will have the networking capabilities included or easily added.<br />
<br />
#4. Batteries<br />
<br />
Mobile workers need laptops that have long battery lives and even better are laptops that allow you to add an extra battery. You never know if your mobile work will take you to places where electricity is not an option. Traveling by air, rail or bus are prime examples. It's also worth looking at how long it takes to recharge your laptop batteries.<br />
<br />
#5. Security Features<br />
<br />
Mobile office workers must accept that their laptop will be a prime target for theft. Know what security measures you can take and what security options are available with the laptop you choose. Making the decision for a higher-end laptop that includes security options can save you money and grief.<br />
<br />
#6 Specifications<br />
<br />
Just as mobile office workers need to consider the above, they must also realize what the minimum and maximum acceptable specifications laptops have. It makes no sense to buy the smallest laptop possible but not have the processor speed or RAM to carry out your job functions. Keyboards and monitors are also important - if they are too small you won't be able to work effectively and may perhaps cause injury or strain.<br />
<br />
#7. Upgrades<br />
<br />
As with all technology, mobile office technology is constantly changing and improving. If your laptop can't be upgraded it can be become a hindrance rather than an effective tool. Watch for laptops that have onboard components that can't be upgraded and try to avoid those. Remember that networking technology is always improving and changing and you could be left without an efficient means of connecting to your company network or the Internet.<br />
<br />
#8. Warranties &amp; Support<br />
<br />
As a mobile worker it's key that your laptop be in good working order and if you do need repair work that you have resources for either quick repair or replacement. Purchasing additional warranty coverage and getting 24/7 support are important considerations when looking at laptop manufacturers. It's also important to know if the laptop manufacturer provides local and/or international support.</div></div><hr />

You can purchase new, used or refurbished or even lease a laptop. Decide what factors are most important and keep in mind what your budget will allow. If state of the art technology is key, then leasing is your best option. Examine your options before you buy a lapop.<br />
<br />
     *The Case for Leasing:<br />
<br />
Do you buy your laptop or lease a laptop? That question is one that mobile office professionals and their companies must consider carefully.<br />
<br />
Ensuring that mobile office professionals have the best equipment is paramount to ensuring their success on the road. Working with out-dated mobile gear and attempting to use workarounds can cost a company time and money, which defeats the purpose of mobilizing their workforce.<br />
<br />
What's at Stake?<br />
<br />
Its important for mobile office workers to keep up with technology especially as it relates to mobile office technology. Networking and software programs are constantly changing and upgrading. If you purchase your laptop, odds are its already obsolete; it can be difficult and expensive to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Leasing on the other hand provides you with a laptop that is current technology and most leasing arrangements have options for trading in for newer and more up-to-date models.<br />
<br />
Review the pros and cons of leasing and use that information to determine whether you should purchase or lease your laptop.<br />
<br />
     * Previously Owned Laptops<br />
<br />
Should You Buy One?<br />
<br />
While we all would like to purchase a brand new laptop, that is not always possible. Previously owned laptops can be the ideal purchase solution for some mobile office professionals. With how quickly new models are released and the fact that many companies upgrade frequently, you may find some very good bargains in the used laptop categories.<br />
<br />
Upgradability:<br />
<br />
It is important to check the laptop and learn if you can upgrade any components especially networking capabilities. While it may be ideal to have the newest and best technology, sometimes budgets don't allow for that. Finding a previously owned laptop that will meet your requirements can take time, but the time will be worth finding the laptop that can function best for you.<br />
<br />
You should be aware that there are differences between used and refurbished laptops.</div></div><hr />

Mobile workers must know how to set up their mobile gear to connect to Wi-Fi locations. Using WinXP in this tutorial, we'll go through the steps for setting up a laptop to access a Wi-Fi network. Some Wi-Fi cards can be set to automatically detect and connect to Wi-Fi networks. It is still important to know how to manually set up your Wi-Fi card to connect to a Wi-Fi network.<br />
<br />
1. Before you attempt to use any Wi-Fi network, find out what the SSID, Channel, Mode and WEP key are. Some Wi-Fi locations do not require a WEP key. Many Wi-Fi providers have this information on their web site or when you purchase access you will be provided the information.<br />

     * Laptop Battery Basics<br />
<br />
Top 10 Laptop Battery Basics<br />
<br />
Take care of your laptop battery and ensure that it will be ready to work properly when you need it most. Some general tips for laptop care include: avoid extreme temperatures, don&#8217;t leave a laptop outside in cold weather or leave it in a hot car. Cold batteries can&#8217;t create very much power and hot batteries will discharge very quickly. Use electrical power when available to keep battery charged. Don&#8217;t let your laptop go for long periods of time without using the battery.<br />
<br />
#1. Smaller Is Better<br />
Consider an ultraportable or thin-and-light rather than a desktop replacement laptop. Smaller displays use less power. Going with a hard drive that runs at 4200rpm uses less power than a hard drive running at 5400rpm.<br />
<br />
#2. Power Control<br />
Use as little power as possible by adjusting laptop settings. Use the Power Options to set to the laptop to go inactive after a set amount of time. Set adjustments so that the display goes off first, then hard the hard drive stay active a bit longer and store the system content&#8217;s to the RAM.<br />
<br />
#3. Turn Down the Lights<br />
Adjust the display brightness to a lower setting, make sure you can view the screen without squinting. You can also adjust the brightness of the display to suit the conditions you are working in.<br />
<br />
#4. Watch Your Battery Use<br />
Keep an eye on your battery consumption and know how much power you have remaining. Use the battery power icon on the system tray or you can purchase batteries which have LED gauges on the outside of the battery itself.<br />
<br />
#5. Charging It Up<br />
Whenever you have access to a power source, charge the battery. Before you leave on any trips, fully charge the batteries, especially if you don&#8217;t know where or when you might have access to any electrical outlets.<br />
<br />
#6. Get Another Battery<br />
Some laptops are capable of running with two batteries. If you cannot run two batteries, check with the manufacturer to see if there are high capacity batteries available. External batteries can also be used to extend operating time.<br />
<br />
#7. Drain the Battery<br />
The first time you use your laptop with battery power, allow the laptop battery to completely discharge. Do this at least twice and don&#8217;t try to charge the battery when it is half discharged.<br />
<br />
#8. Clean Batteries<br />
Keep the battery and its connections clean and free of debris. Clean your battery terminals on a regular basis using a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol on the tip.<br />
<br />
#9. CMOS Battery Check-Up<br />
The backup battery is a CMOS battery which is a secondary battery to power the clock and can drain a main battery if it is dead. Check with your User Manual or manufacturer&#8217;s web site for the location of the CMOS battery and where to get a replacement.<br />
<br />
#10. Turning It Off<br />
Don&#8217;t run programs or devices that you aren&#8217;t using. Remove PC cards and turn off Wi-Fi software. Using your laptop to watch movies or play games will drain the battery quickly as well.</div></div><hr />

Top 6 Threats to Safety &amp; Security of Mobilized Workers<br />
<br />
Are you sure that your mobile workforce is safe and secure? How well are your mobilized workers prepared to deal with the potential of threats against their mobile gear and the data they contain? Knowing what potential threats are possible and taking the correct security measures before a mobile worker leaves the office will help ensure that your company data and network remain safe from harm and financial loss. Prevention is key to ensuring the safety of mobile gear and company systems.<br />
<br />
#1. Theft<br />
Theft is the first and most obvious security concern for any mobile professional. Companies must ensure that their mobile workforce have available and use security devices and know how to take care of their mobile gear to prevent theft. All mobile professionals have to be made aware of the target their mobile gadgets are and what to do to prevent theft.<br />
<br />
#2. Unauthorized Access<br />
At any given time unauthorized persons may be attempting to access a corporate network or company files on a mobile device. Unauthorized access can be gained by a malicious party who pretends to be someone else and then uses that initial access to go further into a system. People who do this are referred to as &quot;spoofers&quot;. Mobile professionals must take extreme care with passwords and other authentication methods to prevent a third party from using that information to gain unauthorized access.<br />
<br />
#3. Electronic Eavesdropping<br />
Electronic eavesdropping or &quot;sniffing&quot; is another method employed by persons who wish to access networks or files through a mobile device. Encryption is not a maybe for companies to consider with their mobile workforce but a definite part of ensuring network safety and security. With the increased use of wireless networks, especially hot spots, mobile professionals must be taught to use encryption and use it all the time.<br />
<br />
#4. Modification of Data<br />
Data which has been maliciously modified or tampered with can be used to obtain access to confidential information. It can be difficult to determine how or when a document has been modified and the methods for preventing this type of occurrence are: Encryption, Authorization and Authentication. Programs must be set up which do not allow anonymous users to make changes or have access to sensitive data.<br />
<br />
#5. Hackers<br />
Hackers may use a combination of the above methods or completely new ways to gain access to a system or data and then create problems or plant virus' or Trojans. One hacker can cause serious damage and cost a company large amounts of money in order to repair the damage caused. Implementing and using security measures before you mobilize your workforce will help prevent hackers from gaining access.<br />
<br />
#6. Virus' &amp; Trojans<br />
Email is a fact of life for everyone, especially mobile professionals. Make sure all mobile workers have anti-virus software and keep it updated. One infected mobile device can take down a department or infect an entire network. Just because you have the right prevention solutions in place onsite, doesn't mean that a mobile device won't cause problems when brought back into the office. Identify and make clear to mobile workers the many ways that a virus or Trojan can infect their mobile device.</div></div><hr />
