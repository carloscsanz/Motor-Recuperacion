		1. About the Intel Core i7 series
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logo0000.png" width="79" height="85" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Intel had announced the new i7 core series a long time ago. The new series of processors feature some  interesting  improvements over the previous C2D series. The most noticeable change is the new LGA 1366 socket that the Core i7 uses, meaning that it works in a new motherboard, as well as the support for  triple DDR3 memory.  All the latest Nehalem processors come with a 8MB L2 cache and the  FSB has been replaced by the Intel QuickPath Interconnect architecture, which achieves data transfer speeds as high as 25.6 GB/s. Besides these obvious changes, Intel the Core i7 series are considered as the company's first  &quot;real&quot; Quad core processor  incorporating multiple cores on a single  processor die.
<p>Moreover, the Core i7 processors  eliminate the need for the Northbridge chipset  to manage system memory and link it to the processor with an integrated,  on-die memory controller which links the processor directly to the  system memory. This is what AMD Phenom series have been using for sometime now, so we are excited to see Intel improving the way it manages the available memory resources, which will hopefully lead to a better performance. More information for the Core i7 is available at the Intel' s <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture-silicon/next-gen/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">white  paper</a>.</p>
<p>Below you can see a summary of the important features of the Core i7 processors. </p>

<p>The Core i7 series of CPUs include three models. <img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/ci7_78.gif" width="78" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />retail price. The i7-965 features a higher clock speed and a faster QuickPath Interconnect that further boosts performance. Looking at the retail price, the lower-end i7-920 CPU is an interesting solution priced at  $289, while the i7-940 rumps up to $540 and the highest-end i7-965 up to $999. While the i7-965 is very expensive,  it has two features that overclockers will love:  the overspeed protection has been removed and there is not any  multiplier lock. The TDP is at 130 Watts - which is still high for a Quad core CPU- but the 45nm design should be able to deliver high speeds without requiring the use of huge CPU coolers. </p>

  <p> An additional feature of the new CPUs is the Turbo Boost that adds more performance to your system. This gain is noticeable in  cases where an application  actually uses all four cores of the processor. The CPU-Z software will report some  additional 133Mhz to the running speed of the CPU when the Turbo Boost is enabled. Of course, it can be turned off from the motherboard BIOS. </p>
  <p>We should also mention here that the Core i7 processors are working together with a motherboard based on the new X58 chipset.</p>

<p><strong>- Installation</strong></p>
<p>Installing the PCU in the new LGA 1366 socket is not any different than what you may have already experienced with the previous LGA 775 processors. The socket's design does not allow you to install the CPU in a wrong way:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7595.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7598.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Push the CPU bracket down until you here the click locking sound.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7599.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Your new Core i7 processor should be ready to go in just three minutes. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7600.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7597.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>After connecting all necessary power cables, you can power up your system.  Using the latest CPU-Z we can see more details about the installed processor:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/2.png" width="390" height="442" /></p>
<p>The default core voltage of the Core i7 series is 1.10V, with a maximum of 1.45V. For our tests we used the Foxconn Renaissance X58 motherboard with the bios Ver. P07 installed. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/3.png" width="390" height="442" /></p>
<p>The memory we used is the Crucial  DDR3-1066 rated at CL7-7-7-20-1T with 1.55V. According to Intel, the memory voltage should not exceed the 1.65V in order to avoid damaging the CPU.</p>

<p>The Sisoft Sandra tests confirmed that the Intel i7-920 processor is much faster than any other processor we have tested in past. </p>
<p>We should apologize here for some strange results that appear in the graphs in some tests. The specific test results are coming from our database and were conducted with a previous version of the  Sisoft Sandra software. </p>

		4. Benchmarks - PCMark Vantage, SYSmark 2007 Preview
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><a href="http://www.futuremark.com/products/pcmarkvantage/" target="_blank"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logos/pcmark_vantage.png" alt="Click for homepage!" width="206" height="47" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" /></a>PCMark Vantage is the first objective hardware performance benchmark  for PCs running 32 and 64 bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista.  PCMark Vantage is  suited for benchmarking any type of  Microsoft Windows Vista PC from multimedia home entertainment systems  and laptops to dedicated workstations and hi-end gaming rigs.  The software  shows the user where their system soars or  falls flat, and how to get the most performance possible out of their  hardware. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/pcmark_vantage.png" width="476" height="496" /></p>
<p>The PCMark Vantage is mainly based on 2D applications, which do not benefit from the multi-core CPUs. As a result, the higher clock of the   Intel E8600 CPU was more efficient here but only in the productivity, communications and music tests.  The Intel i7-920 CPU showed its teeth in the Gaming, TV&amp;Movies and Memories tests, where the processor was significantly better than the rest CPUs by Intel and AMD.</p>
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/Logos/sysmark2007.png" align="left" height="117" width="140" />BAPCo's <a href="http://bapco.com/products/sysmark2007preview/" target="_blank">SYSmark 2007 Preview </a> is an application-based benchmark that reflects
  usage patterns of business users in the areas of Video creation,
E-learning, 3D Modeling and Office Productivity. </p>
<p>The benchmark
  utilities utilize real life applications like: Adobe After
  Effects 7, Adobe Illustrator CS2, Adobe Photoshop CS2, AutoDesk 3ds Max
  8, Macromedia Flash 8, Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2003,
  Microsoft PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Project 2003,
  Microsoft Windows Media Encoder 9 series, Sony Vegas 7, SketchUp 5 and
  WinZip 10.0. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/sysmark.png" height="451" width="476" /></p>
<p>Again, most applications that do not include 3D graphics will not be accelerated by the  i7-920 processor, at least compared with a faster CPU in terms of GHz. Despite that, the i7-920 managed to get an overall rating pretty close to the one the Intel E8600 got.</p>

		5. Benchmarks - MAXON CINEBENCH, x264 HD Benchmark, TMPGEnc 4 Xpress 
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/Logos/cinebenchlogo10.jpg" align="left" height="98" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="240" /><a href="http://www.maxon.net/pages/download/cinebench_e.html" target="_blank">MAXON CINEBENCH</a> is based on MAXON's award-winning animation software, CINEMA 4D, which
is used  by studios and production houses worldwide for 3D
content creation. </p>
<p>MAXON CINEBENCH runs several tests on your computer to measure the
  performance of the main processor and the graphics card under real
  world circumstances. The benchmark application makes use of up to 16
  CPUs or CPU cores and is available for Windows (32-bit and 64-Bit) and
  Macintosh (PPC and Intel-based). The resulting values among different
  operating systems are 100% comparable and therefore very useful with
  regard to purchasing decision-making. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/cinebench.png" height="402" width="471" /></p>
<p>The CineBench R10 benchmark unveiled the power of the i7-920 CPU at least in the case where all the four cores were used. The processor was 26 % faster than the Intel Q9300. </p>
<p><strong>- x264 HD Benchmark </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=442" target="_blank">x264 Benchmark</a> utilizes the next generation of Video Encoding benchmarks with support
  for x264 codec that is considered to be one of the most demanding for
Video applications. Simply     put, it is a reproducible measure of fast your machine can encode a short, HD     video clip to a high quality x264 video file. It's nice because everyone running     it will use the identical video clip and software. The video encoder (x264.exe)     reports a fairly accurate internal benchmark (frames per second) for each pass     of the video encode and it also uses multi-core processors very efficiently.     All these factors make this an ideal benchmark to compare different processors     and systems to each other.</p>
<p>The benchmark procedure is very simple, you just run a batch file
  that encodes the same file four times. The software provides two results, one for each pass of encoding. The average performance of this test is available in the charts below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/x264.png" height="406" width="479" /></p>
<p>The x264 HD benchmark stresses out each cpu, since it uses the 100% of its resources. As it was expected, the Intel i7-920 is faster in both FPS1 and FPS2 tests. The CPU was 19% faster by the Intel Q9300 and 13% faster than the AMD 9950BE (first pass of encoding). </p>
<p><strong>- TMPGEnc 4 Xpress </strong></p>
<p>With  MPEGEncoder, the overall encoding time will be reduced as CPU speed gets faster. TMPGEnc converts *.AVI files to MPEG1, the format which is used in  VideoCDs. Using a variety of options in TMPGEnc, you can compress your  video file in high quality. TMPGEnc enables you  to adjust bit rate, quantize matrix, GOP structure, interlacing and many  other parameters so that you can create the most appropriate movie file  depending on your needs.</p>
<p>For our test we use an AVI file around 350MB encoded with the Xvid (Mpeg4 ASP) codec. We use the build-in Mpeg4 ASP/AVC MediaEncoder profile and by dividing the amount of total frames via the  encoding time, we get the average frame/sec speed of each processor. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.nerodigital.com" target="_blank"></a><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/tmpgenc.png" width="479" height="427" /></p>
<p>Again, the  Intel i7-920 is more efficient in both ASP/AVC encoding. Compared with the  Q9300, it is  faster by almost  25FPS.</p>

		6. Benchmarks - SuperPI, wPrime
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><a href="http://www.xtremesystems.com/pi/" target="_blank">SuperPI</a> has become a utility for benchmarking modern systems. In August 1995, the calculation of pi up to 4,294,960,000 decimal  digits was succeeded by using a supercomputer and SuperPI, in  the University of  Tokyo. The program was written by D.Takahashi and he collaborated with  Dr. Y.Kanada at the computer center, the University of Tokyo. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.xtremesystems.com/pi/" target="_blank"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logos/19.png" width="264" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>The software offers up to 32M calculations of PI numbers. For our tetsts, we  selected  8M calculations: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/superpi_1.png" width="481" height="362" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/superpi_2.png" width="482" height="363" /></p>
<p>This time, the  Intel i7-920 got a very low score.. </p>
<p><strong>- wPrime </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wprime.net/" target="_top">wPrime</a> is a benchmarking application designed to use a highly  multithreaded approach to calculating the square-roots of large amounts  of numbers (up to 32 billion at this stage!)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logos/wprime.png" width="490" height="263" /></p>
<p>Theh software utilizes  all the cores of a quad processor, therefore it can finish the fask much faster than a C2D. </p>

		7. Benchmarks - 3DMark06, Crysis v1.2
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><a href="http://www.futuremark.com/products/3dmark06/" target="_blank"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logos/3dmark_06_logo.gif" alt="Click for homepage!" width="266" height="55" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" /></a>3DMark&reg;06 is the worldwide standard in advanced 3D game performance benchmarking. The software uses advanced real-time 3D game workloads to measure PC performance using a suite of DirectX 9 3D graphics tests, CPU tests, and 3D feature tests. 3DMark06 tests include all new HDR/SM3.0 graphics tests, SM2.0 graphics tests, AI and physics driven single and multiple cores or processor CPU tests and a collection of comprehensive feature tests to measure gaming performance. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/3dmark06.png" width="478" height="442" /></p>
<p>The  CPU test rely on AI, physics and game logic to generate a multi-threaded   workload that can be distributed on multiple processors, cores or even on a   single processor. Aegia PhysX library and D* Lite path finding AI algorithm are   used to produce demanding CPU loads. It is obvious that the i7-920 CPU was pretty strong here and got the best score. </p>
<p>However, the overall 3D game performance was not significantly higher than the other CPUs of this test. Despite the numerous enhancements of the new  i7-920 CPU, it seems that your expectations for higher FPS at games should ne limited. </p>
<p> We will find out more on that by running a Crysis (1024x768) CPU benchmark:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/crysis.png" width="477" height="383" /></p>
<p>We cannot say that we have an absolute winner here. All CPUs performed almost equally, and the new i7-920 processor did not made the difference. The Intel E8600 did the same job. Considering that the E8600 is around 640MHz faster than the Intel i7-920 processor and that its cost is much lower than its new brother, we may say that the C2D processors is a better value-for-money solution. Of course, the i7-920 could be more futureproof as more games that use multiple cores are expected to appear. </p>


	<h5 STYLE="background-color:lightYellow;"><hr WIDTH="98%">
		8. Overclocking
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>Overclocking the new  Intel i7 series is somehow different than you may have experienced until now  since the Term &quot;FSB&quot; has now been replaced by four multipliers  on the motherboard, which are used to change the  system's speed: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <div align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>CPU Speed</strong>: When  multiplied by the system base clock speed (default 133.33 MHz) gives  the CPU frequency. Four multipliers are used to define different speeds  based on the number of active CPU cores. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Memory Speed</strong>:  When multiplied by the system base clock speed gives the memory  frequency. For example a memory multiplier of 10 times the base clock  of 133.33 MHz results in a memory frequency of 1333 MHz. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Quick Path Interconnect (QPI) Speed</strong>: Selectable transfer rate of data transferred between the CPU and the IOH. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align="left"> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Uncore Speed</strong>:  This multiplier applies to the non-CPU related items in the processor.  The limit on this multiplier is set by the memory multiplier. </font></div>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Since the Intel Core i7-920 is multiplier-locked, you can only increase the base clock (CPU Speed). For our tests we used the Intel stock cooler, which proved to be very efficient, at least for the short time overclocking (~30mins) period we used to  test the system's stability. Using bigger and aftermarket coolers could further improve overclocking and increase your processor's life.</p>
<p align="left">The default Vcore for the Intel Core i7-920 is 1.10V. You need to manually increase the Vcore - the sweet point for getting up to 3.60GHz (!) is the 1.25V. Since the memory is synced to the Bus speed, a good idea is to  increase the DDR3 voltage as well, with the 1.65V to be the maximum value. Our first attempt was successful and very stable, even with the Intel's stock cooler installed. We also enabled the  Turbo function, hence the Bus speed was reported at 181.3MHz, although we had set it at   180MHz through the BIOS. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/oc/1.png" width="395" height="444" /></p>
<p align="left">Although the  1.25Voltage is considered as high,  the reported temperatures were adequate. The CoreTemp software reported a temperature of ~75 degrees Celsius, while the RealTemp gave ~70 degrees  at full load. Meanwhile, the  memory  was running at CL9 so we  may be able to further tune this and get better results. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/oc/oc2-1.25V.png" width="490" height="617" /></p>
<p align="left">The temperature at idle mode, was ~ 40 degrees Celsius  and this time, we had the memory running at CL7@ 1450MHz, while the Intel Core i7-920 was running at 3.60GHz. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/oc/oc2-1.26V.png" width="490" height="595" /></p>
<p align="left">If you want to get  even higher, you should  further increase the Vcore. The  sweet point of the 3.80GHz should be stable enough with 1.35V. The Crucial memory had to be moved to CL8 since we had already reached the 1530MHz with 1.65V. At that time, the CPU temperature was very high (90 degrees C) with the Intel stock cooler installed. So it would be recommended to use a better cooler at these speeds.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/oc/oc_380-135.png" width="490" height="593" /> </p>
<p align="left">By using a water-cooling solution and  a higher Vcore, it is possible to reach the 4.0GHz.</p>
<p align="left"> It would be interesting to see here where an  Intel Core i7-920  stands against  an overclocked Q9300 at their &quot;maximum&quot; speeds: </p>

<p>The overclocked Intel Core i7-920 CPU gives an impressive performance, especially in the Video encoding applications. The performance difference is up to  28~36%, while at the wPrime reaches up to 43%! However, when looking at office applications over PCMark Vantage, the i7-920 is has a very small lead over the Intel Q300 CPU. </p>

		9. Conclusion
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/logo0000.png" width="79" height="85" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />The newly introduced Intel Core i7 series  of CPUs pack several interesting technologies and the inclusion of the memory controller at the chipset  further boosts memory performance. The Intel Core i7-920 is the lowest-priced product but still, its  ~&euro;290  retail price makes it quiet expensive for entry level users. In addition, the newly introduced socket  LGA 1366 requires a new chipset to work with and all the currently available  X58   motherboards are very expensive. Finally, in order to  maximize the platform's  performance you do need to invest on new triple-channel DDR3 memory. In short, in order to get a system running, you have to spend around &euro;700+  and get  at least a 30% higher performance than an Intel C2Q9300 processor. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/IMG_7587.jpg" width="400" height="429" /></p>
<p>The question might be who would be benefited from such an investment... There are many power users who  always seek to  get the latest and fastest systems and thus, they are willing to spend money for it. The X58 is a  gaming platform  that also supports both ATI's Crossfire and Nvidia's SLI technologies, simplifying future graphics setups. </p>
<p>However we feel that not many users are looking for such high-priced solutions, unless you cannot do without playing your games at resolutions of 1920+ .. </p>
<p>Getting down to the facts, the Intel Core i7-920 is much faster than any currently sold C2D/C2Q processor. The embedded memory controller does the job very well and as it was expected, the overclocking margins are very wide. We  managed to overclock the CPU more than 1.0GHz higher than its nominal clock, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/I/Intel Core i7-920/Images/oc/1.png" width="389" height="441" /></p>
<p> However, have in mind that such overclocking attempts require to install an aftermarket CPU cooling cooling since the produced heat is high, despite the 45nm manufacturing process. </p>
<p>Getting to the high-end Intel Core i7-965 requires a fortune but this processor is multiplier unlocked, so it might offer you  much more space for overclocking.</p>
<p>We feel that gamers would be more benefited by an  Intel E8500/8600 processor after overclocking, since not many games are currently taking full advantage of the new i7 CPUs. So at least for now, we think that the investment is weak. Prices are expected to decline in more than 6 months from now, according to industry sources. But with Intel already talking about a &quot;new&quot; LGA platform that will come some time in the middle of 2009, we feel that the i7 series will hardly power the  mainstream PCs. </p>
