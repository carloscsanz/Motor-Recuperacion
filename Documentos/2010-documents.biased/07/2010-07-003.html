		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Elpida Memory, Inc., Japan's leading global supplier of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), today announced that it had completed development of a 65nm XS extra-shrink version 1-Gigabit DDR3 SDRAM that is as cost-competitive as 50nm process memory devices.<br />
<br />
In response to the slump in the DRAM market that has lasted since 2008, Elpida is taking a two-track R&D approach that focuses on conventional process migration and on layout innovations that reduce the cost of capital investment. Along with migrating to advanced processes such as 50nm and 40nm the company is developing shrunken chip versions through extensive use of existing ArF dry scanner equipment. As a result, a 65nm S shrink version was developed in 2008 and now a 65nm XS extra-shrink version has been completed.<br />
<br />
The 65nm XS is a smaller version of the already shrunken 65nm S and delivers 25% more chips per 300mm wafer compared with its predecessor. In addition to its extremely small chip size the XS shortens the manufacturing process and helps to greatly reduce equipment costs through the use of ArF dry scanner equipment. Chips costs are comparable to 50nm process products.<div style="padding-top:5px;">&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="index.php?110730">&raquo; Read full story</a></div></div>

		<div class="newstext">Elpida Memory, Inc., Japan's leading global supplier of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), today announced that it had begun sample shipments of a 2-gigabit x32-bit I/O DDR2 SDRAM that operates up to a high speed of 1066 Mbps. The new memory device is capable of meeting the need for 1.8V x32-bit and x16-bit I/O as well as low-voltage 1.5V x32-bit and x16-bit I/O.<br />
<br />
Rapid advances in the image quality and functionality of digital TV, digital still cameras and other new digital consumer equipment have led to a growing need for memory that can deliver faster speeds, higher densities and wide-bit configurations. Elpida's newly developed 2-gigabit density x32-bit I/O product provides an optimal solution for these needs. Systems with a 32-bit CPU that require 2-gigabit memory density have until now had rely on a conventional 1-gigabit x16-bit I/O two-chip design. Elpida's new 2-gigabit x32-bit I/O product, however, reduces by half the number of mounted memory chips, simplifies high-speed memory bus design, conserves chip mounting space and lowers power consumption.<br />

		<div class="newstext">Following earlier reports of failing memory modules with Elpida Hyper chips, first Corsair and now OCZ Technology is stopping sales of Elpida Hyper DRAMs. Although OCZ claims it has not yet seen extended failures in its Elpida Hyper equipped memory modules, because an earlier batches were used, it is also pulling out the presumably affected memory modules and memory kits. This is OCZ's official statement:<blockquote><hr class="quote" />In regards to the potential issues relating to Elpida Hyper IC's, OCZ has not yet seen extended failures in the field, and the Elipda Hyper IC's we have used came from earlier batches so we do not yet know if this is the reason why we are not seeing field issues but as a proactive measure based on the latest information from media reviewers like AnandTech we have officially held the use of any Elpida Hyper IC's at this time. Any customers that are seeing issues are encouraged to contact us and we will absolutely take care of all customers with a no questions asked refund or exchange for another OCZ product of equal value, whichever the customer prefers. We want to make sure that our customers have peace of mind and the confidence that we will take care of any and all issues related to modules that utilize Elpida Hyper chips.<hr class="quote" /></blockquote><small>Source: <a href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?p=408146#post408146" target="_blank">OCZ Support Forums</a></small></div>

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">GeIL wants to be the first manufacturer touting the term "hexa-channel" (6-channel) DDR3 memory. While machine architectures using 6-channels (384-bit wide) memory interfaces don't exist, dual-Nehalem Xeon machines use two triple-channel memory arrays. It's a play of the word "6-channels" there. In any case, GeIL is now selling DDR3 memory in kits of six modules. Its lineup spans across three of its main memory product-lines: Value, Ultra, and Gaming series. The kits are available in a variety of configurations that include specified DRAM speeds, and timings, as listed by the table below. The kits come backed by the company's lifetime warranty. <br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Known by computer enthusiasts to be the company with some top quality PC coolers, Xigmatek, has a new product up its sleeve: the Dragoon N422 memory module heatsink cooler. The cooler serves as a replacement for the heatspreaders or stock-heatsinks memory modules come with. It can latch onto most standard-sized 240-pin DDR2 and DDR3 modules. <br />
<br />
The cooler consists of two units that dissipate heat from either sides of the module. Each unit consists of a metal plate that makes contact with the module. The plate itself propagates into an arrangement of aluminum fins, but the interesting component is the copper heatpipe that runs through the length of the plate. The heatpipe makes direct contact the memory chips, and conveys heat to a small yet dense aluminum fin array. Two such plates are latched onto a module using screws. The total weight of the cooler per module (two plates) is 105g. It measures 131.1 (L) x 76.5 (W) x 9.6 (H) mm. Due to its design, the cooler can be used only on double-sided modules (modules with DRAM chips on both sides). The Dragoon N422 is yet to reach retail channels so we could tell its price. <br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Hynix forms one of the top-tier DRAM manufacturers. On Sunday, the company made it official that its new 1 Gb (128 MB) DDR3 memory chip built on the new 40 nm silicon fabrication process, will enter mass production by the third quarter, and be available to manufacturers soon after. The chip (model: H5TQ1G83CFR) operates with a top-speed of 2,133 Mbps, at a wide range of voltage. <br />
<br />
Using the three-dimensional transistor technology, the company has stepped-up productivity by more than 50% over its current DRAM chips built on the 50 nm process. The new technology is said to minimize electric leakages and reduces overall power consumption of the DRAM chip. The new 1Gb memory chip meets Intel's DDR3 DRAM specification compliance and the memory module will be examined for certification by Intel.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Late last month, DRAM major Qimonda announced insolvency. This company now has a month's cash left to carry on operations, before having to dissolve its assets. The company is reportedly looking for buyers. The news of Qimonda's departure in the making, for the industry didn't have immediate repercussions post announcement, since it coincided with a week of holidays on the occasion of the Chinese Lunar New Year. <br />
<br />
When the traders returned to work after the holiday, DRAM prices shot up due to widespread concerns over the departure of Qimonda disturbing supply-chains. The price of the DRAM chip used as a standard to gauge DRAM prices, a common DDR2-667 1Gbit (128MB) chip, rose by as much as 27% to US $1.08, as measured by DRAMeXchange, a company that runs online DRAM chip stock clearance sales. Analysts at Gartner predict short-term and long-term implications of Qimonda's exit: on the short-term, DRAM prices will rise as the fall of Qimonda will disturb supply-chains. On the long term though, the market will stabilize since it is still saturated with DRAM over-supply even without Qimonda. It isn't a good time to buy DRAM chips, as a result of which, other weaker DRAM companies may also file for bankruptcy, disturbing supply-chains.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Leading CPU makers Intel and AMD have adopted memory standards in fairly quick succession in the past. This however, doesn't seem to be the case with DDR3. AMD is yet to release a CPU that supports DDR3 memory, and is two years behind Intel with its DDR3 implementation plans. Intel on the other hand has managed 100% DDR3 dependency with only its premium Core i7 platform, with DDR3 not completely replacing DDR2 in any of its mainstream or value lineups. <br />
<br />
Market factors, namely the DRAM manufacturing industry, are increasingly posing difficulties to CPU makers to bring DDR3 memory at a consumer-friendly price point. With manufacturing costs refusing to come down and the Core i7 not able generate the expected demand that justifies selling triple channel kits at sub-$100 price-points, CPU makers are rethinking their large-scale DDR3 standard transition plans for their entire lineups. Intel on its part is contemplating on postponing its 5-series mainstream platform for the Intel Core i5 series processors. AMD on the other hand, is still struggling with technical difficulties in achieving stability and compatibility with DDR3 memory on its DDR3-supportive memory controllers the upcoming AM3-socket CPUs come with. So the company is also unlikely to transition to DDR3 until it is able to come out with a workable BIOS, sources add. It could be as long as 2010 by when a 100% industry-wide implementation of DDR3 can take place.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">Elpida and Buffalo Technologies have unearthed a memory standard never before heard, and thought by many, as the limits of current DDR3 technology, given the silicon fabrication process current DRAM chips are made with. The elusive PC3-19200 standard has been achieved. Elpida has tested stable, a prototype memory module that runs at 2400 MHz DDR (1200 MHz actual clock-rate). The modules use Elpida's 2.5 Gbps DRAM chips. <br />
<br />
These speeds, however, come at the cost of latencies and voltages. The module was tested stable at 2400 MHz only at 11-11-11-34, and a voltage of 2.1 V, which is high, by DDR3 standards. However, the module locks a surprise when it comes to the same numbers: The module was tested stable at 2096 MHz, at amazingly low 1.5V, with much tighter timings of 9-10-9-24. The companies wish to put this to mass production soon.<br />

		</div>
		<div class="newstext">With many economies under inflation and other factors influencing a weak demand, these are perhaps the worst days for several companies involved in manufacture, marketing and distribution of DRAM and related products. While on the surface, all the consumer can see is a falling market price, in reality it is a composed chaos. <br />
<br />
DigiTimes reports a falling demand for DRAM in the Asia-Pacific region as the Chinese government cracks down on users of contraband DRAM products brought in from manufacturing states. The government crackdown began with the thousands of internet-shacks and the components (both hardware and software) they used. All this comes ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a 'purge drive'. As a result, thousands of internet-shacks have been closed, bans have been imposed on the use of contraband hardware, most of which consist of DRAM related hardware. China also brought about changes in their customs routines and procedures making it extremely complicated for importers, stepping up waiting queues, affecting markets and more importantly, dampening demand. <div style="padding-top:5px;">&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="index.php?64237">&raquo; Read full story</a></div></div>
