<p class="normal1">It was a Sunday Phuket Governor Udomsak Uswarangkura 
                    will never forget. He first heard that something had happened 
                    when a friend called, saying there had been flooding in Karon.<br>
                    <br>
                    He went to the Provincial Hall to await a call confirming 
                    a trip to Koh Racha in Khao Lak by HRH Princess Ubol Ratana 
                    Rajakanya and, meanwhile, rang the police to check the flooding 
                    report.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;My friend at Karon had told me it had been tidal waves, 
                    a first wave and then a second coming across the road,&#8221; 
                    Gov Udomsak told the Gazette. &#8220;So I contacted the police, 
                    asking them to tell me what the situation was.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The news was not good. The Governor took a helicopter to check 
                    damage at Chalong, Patong, Kamala and Bang Tao: &#8220;I saw 
                    many broken boats, and umbrellas and chairs floating in the 
                    sea. At Patong damaged boats and cars were strewn in the street. 
                    I could see the damage was severe.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;After my bird&#8217;s eye view I called the Meteorological 
                    Office, and they told me there had been a tsunami. I asked, 
                    &#8216;Are you sure?&#8217;, and they said it had happened 
                    after an earthquake measuring 9.2 on the Richter Scale. I 
                    knew we had an extremely serious situation on our hands.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The Governor examined a contingency plan that had been drawn 
                    up for use in the event of a natural disaster, but quickly 
                    decided it was unworkable in these circumstances. It was also 
                    not up to date.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I then co-ordinated five units that could work together 
                    &#8211; doctors, the Office of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation 
                    (ODPM), district officers, local administration organizations 
                    and the police,&#8221; he said.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I ordered the Provincial Operations Center (POC) at 
                    Phuket Provincial Hall to be opened, and had [extra] phones 
                    installed. I got the Phuket Provincial Administration Office 
                    to ask all groups involved to work out of the POC. We updated 
                    Bangkok on the situation, reporting [what numbers we had of] 
                    the dead and injured.&#8221;<br>

                  <p class="normal1"><br>
                    Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived in the evening from 
                    Khon Kaen Province.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I realized that many foreigners wanted us to repatriate 
                    them,&#8221; the Governor said. &#8220;The PM ordered Thai 
                    Airways to help. He said that as many people as possible [who 
                    wanted to go] should be taken to Don Muang International Airport 
                    or Tham-masat University in Bangkok. We needed to help those 
                    injured, many of whom had lost all their money, possessions 
                    and documents.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The 38 foreign ambassadors accredited to Thailand began arriving 
                    in Phuket, and an International Assistance Unit (IAT) was 
                    set up at the Provincial Administration Organization (OrBorJor) 
                    building.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I used to be Director-General of the Civil Defense 
                    Division of the Department of Local Administration in Bangkok, 
                    and one of my responsibilities was disaster management,&#8221; 
                    Gov Udomsak said. &#8220;I used this experience, and the help 
                    of some of my [former] colleagues who also knew how to cope 
                    with such an event.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    It became clear from early on that communications systems 
                    would have a problem coping in the aftermath. Mobile phone 
                    networks rapidly became overloaded, and all but useless.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I had to use amateur radio links to communicate with 
                    other officials,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[For example], the 
                    first night, while we were awaiting the PM&#8217;s arrival 
                    at Chai football field, we received requests by radio to pick 
                    up people from the Phi Phi Islands.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;By the end of the first day, we had organized emergency 
                    equipment to help clear the beach with the help of soldiers. 
                    They worked with OrBorTor and municipality staff to begin 
                    clearing away wreckage, starting in the early morning of the 
                    second day. The task was urgent.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Doctors continued to help the injured, and also co-operated 
                    with the police to identify the bodies of victims whenever 
                    that was possible.<br>
                    <br>
                    After the PM&#8217;s decision on the first night to evacuate 
                    people to Bangkok, the Governor went to Phuket International 
                    Airport on Day Two.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I asked how many airlines could fly people to Bangkok, 
                    because I saw there were around 500 people waiting in the 
                    multi-purpose meeting hall at the airport. The airport director 
                    said he needed to give priority to people who already had 
                    tickets, but I said &#8216;No, that&#8217;s not what PM Thaksin 
                    ordered&#8217;.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I phoned Bangkok, saying we needed more aircraft, and 
                    that we had to talk to the low-cost airlines so we could help 
                    people. I also said we would have to apologize to passengers 
                    in other areas of the country [if their flights were canceled] 
                    because planes were needed to evacuate people from Phuket.&#8221;</p>
                  <p> On the second night the Governor went to Patong with officials 
                    from the Ministry of the Interior.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;It was very calm and quiet, with nobody around,&#8221; 
                    he said. &#8220;With no electricity, there was complete darkness. 
                    It was around midnight when I took them to Patong. We had 
                    a moment&#8217;s silence for everyone [who had died].<br>
                    <br>
                    He then went to the airport, where he stayed until midnight. 
                    The airlines co-operated well with the authorities, he said, 
                    both in Phuket and in Bangkok: &#8220;On December 27 and 28, 
                    we repatriated about 4,000 people. We tried to move as many 
                    people as possible.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    So what lessons were learned during the first few days following 
                    the disaster?<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;We needed better public relations,&#8221; Gov Udomsak 
                    said. &#8220;Some people did not understand what we were doing, 
                    but the priority had to be foreign tourists: they are Phuket&#8217;s 
                    customers, so we helped them first. <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;Of course, we helped Thais, too, but we still received 
                    complaints that we were ignoring them. It was a crucial time, 
                    and everyone needed help.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Since the tsunami, new procedures have been put in place, 
                    based on the experiences of the many different groups of officials 
                    involved in managing the aftermath of the disaster.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I have created an internal task force for each department,&#8221; 
                    he said. &#8220;Each unit has to be able to work together 
                    with all the others &#8211; this is the key to success. We 
                    now also have an evacuation plan [for moving large numbers 
                    of people] for Phuket airport.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    On March 28 this year, there was a major alert following another 
                    big undersea earthquake centered off southern Sumatra &#8211; 
                    similar to the seismic event that gave birth to the December 
                    26 tsunami.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, there was no repeat of last year&#8217;s catastrophe, 
                    but the March scare did highlight shortcomings in the new 
                    disaster response system. Again, the focus was on communications.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;We had to use mobile cell masts and radios,&#8221; 
                    Gov Udomsak said. <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;After that [March 28 alert] I supported the amateur 
                    radio association in setting up a mobile unit to help in times 
                    of trouble. It gives us a communications link between the 
                    tambon administration organizations (<em>OrBorTor</em>), the 
                    <em>OrBorJor</em> and the municipalities.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Redundancy &#8211; or duplication of systems &#8211; is a 
                    tactic well known in many industries, and the Governor believes 
                    it is just as important in dealing with disasters.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;There may even be duplication&#8221; in aid efforts, 
                    he said, &#8220;with some people getting more than enough 
                    help because so many organizations are working to help them 
                    &#8211; Civil Defense and student volunteers, the Thai Red 
                    Cross ... But I don&#8217;t mind. People get help, and that 
                    is what matters.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    One thing he does stress, however, is that management of aid 
                    has to be seen to be fair. &#8220;We tried to make the question 
                    of disaster-relief donations completely clear and transparent,&#8221; 
                    he said. <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;This was a major event in history, and I had to account 
                    for everything. I asked my vice-governors who were responsible 
                    for each specific task to ensure there was proper documentation 
                    [on how the money was spent].<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;Everything about our response to the tsunami, both 
                    good and bad, will be written in the history books,&#8221; 
                    he added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my name or reputation 
                    to be bad in this case. I did everything I could to make sure 
                    it was good.&#8221;<br>

                  <p class="normal1">That the tsunami struck Thailand with no warning having been 
                    issued is a fact that remains uncomfortable for many, not 
                    just for those who lost relatives in the disaster.<br>
                    <br>
                    The frustration still felt was expressed by families of 91 
                    Britons who died in the tsunami, and whose inquests were held 
                    in London between December 5 and 8. The relatives are a world 
                    away from the beach resorts of the Indian Ocean, and although 
                    Phuket is back, their loved ones never can be.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sally Pook reported in the<em> Daily Telegraph</em> on December 
                    6 that Liz Jones, whose daughter, Charlotte, 24, died on Koh 
                    Racha Yai, said, &#8220;If my daughter had had five minutes, 
                    she would have been alive today.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Speaking at the mass inquest, expert witness Dr Tim Henstock 
                    of the University of Southampton&#8217;s School of Earth and 
                    Ocean Science was reported by the BBC as saying, &#8220;The 
                    people who knew the earthquake had happened were not in a 
                    position to do anything in terms of warning on the ground.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    He continued, &#8220;An early warning system does not help 
                    unless you have infrastructure and mechanisms, and everyone 
                    knows what is supposed to be done if a warning comes in.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Phuket, indeed Thailand, now has a warning system, controlled 
                    from the National Disaster Warning Center (NDWC) in Nonthaburi, 
                    and the infrastructure and mechanisms are in place.<br>
                    <br>
                    The well-publicized drill conducted in Patong on December 
                    16, which saw around 200 people take part, was declared a 
                    success despite, ironically, the rain.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, more telling were the events of just two days earlier, 
                    when a &#8220;silent test&#8221; &#8211; these are conducted 
                    twice a day &#8211; was anything but. For reasons unknown, 
                    the alarms in all six provinces with tsunami warning towers 
                    sounded at noon.<br>
                    <br>
                    Although reports are vague and precise figures difficult to 
                    obtain, it appears that many people on the beaches or otherwise 
                    close to the shore did exactly what they should have done 
                    under the circumstances: they ran for their lives.<br>
                    <br>
                    The system does appear to be working &#8211; even though the 
                    network of 62 warning towers has yet to be completed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Air Chief Marshal Anuphan Sanitwong na Ayutthaya, Deputy Director 
                    of the NDWC, gave an insight to the system.<br>
                    <br>
                    He explained first that the threat to Phuket and the other 
                    five provinces covered by the system stems from the Sunda 
                    Trench Fault (STF), which marks the convergent boundary of 
                    principally the Sunda and Burma Plates, with the India and 
                    Australian Plates.<br>
                    <br>
                    The subduction of the India plate beneath the Burma micro-plate 
                    west of Sumatra, some 700 kilometers southwest of Phuket, 
                    caused the earthquake at 7:58:53 am local time that triggered 
                    the December 26 tsunami.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The trench &#8211; its closest point it is approximately 
                    450km due west of Phuket &#8211; runs more-or-less north to 
                    south from just north of the Andaman and Nico-bar Islands 
                    running southwest of Sumatra,&#8221; ACM Anuphan said, adding, 
                    &#8220;[because of] seismic activity in this area, these plates 
                    are the focus of the NDWC&#8217;s attention.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    A tsunami, if generated by submarine seismic activity along 
                    the STF, would take around two hours to reach Phuket.<br>
                    <br>
                    Information on seismic activity is gathered &#8211; and shared 
                    &#8211; by the Thai government and neighboring countries, 
                    particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. Thailand also monitors 
                    information from Germany, the UK, Japan and the US.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The NDWC, which has sole and complete responsibility 
                    to issue warnings in Thailand &#8211; and of course is manned 
                    around the clock &#8211; will analyze data collected, with 
                    particular regard to the magnitude of an earthquake, its depth 
                    and the type of seismic movement.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    ACM Anuphan said that an earthquake occurring 100 or more 
                    kilometers beneath the seabed is unlikely to cause an tsunami. 
                    &#8220;The closer to the surface, then the more likely a tsunami 
                    is,&#8221; he said.<br>
                    <br>
                    The United States Geological Survey website says that the 
                    December 26 quake occurred approximately 30km below the seabed.<br>

                    ACM Anuphan said that the movement of the plates &#8211; strike-slip 
                    or thrust-fault &#8211; is also checked. Major earthquakes 
                    tend to be thrust-fault earthquakes, which are more likely 
                    to cause a tsunami, such as that of December 26, which is 
                    referred to as a &#8220;megathrust&#8221; event.<br>
                    <br>
                    He warned that it is impossible to determine whether an earthquake 
                    was strike-slip or thrust-fault in less than three hours. 
                    &#8220;This is more than the length of time it would take 
                    a tsunami to reach the areas of Thailand deemed at risk from 
                    the STF,&#8221; he cautioned.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;Additionally, and although we can make an accurate 
                    and almost immediate determination of the magnitude of a quake, 
                    the precise location takes 20 to 25 minutes to determine.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    ACM Anuphan said that an earthquake of magnitude (M) 3 to 
                    4.9 cannot generate a tsunami, and although unlikely, a M5.0 
                    to M5.9 earthquake could. &#8220;The NDWC would issue an advisory 
                    to the Prime Minister and other Cabinet members, as well as 
                    governors [of the six tsunami-affected provinces] if an event 
                    of this magnitude occurred.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;A tsunami would be unlikely, yes, but we would issue 
                    the advice [to them] to prevent the spread of rumors.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;From M6.0 to M6.9 there is a low chance of a tsunami 
                    and the same procedures will be followed, although we will 
                    monitor the situation much more carefully.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The chance of a tsunami increases with M7.0 to M7.9 
                    earthquakes, and the NDWC enters the &#8216;alert and watching&#8217; 
                    stage, with careful analysis of sea levels from tidal gauges 
                    in Thailand and the region, and water-pressure data from various 
                    organizations such as the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
                    Commission and Pacific Tsunami Warning Center,&#8221; he said.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The tidal gauges in the region are too close to the 
                    shore to give adequate warning, but Thailand is soon to start 
                    deploying deep-sea buoys in her [maritime] economic zone between 
                    Anda-man coastal regions and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 
                    These will be around 200km apart.&#8221; [Thailand&#8217;s 
                    maritime exclusive economic zone is 200 nautical miles, or 
                    370km.]<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, the network of DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and 
                    Reporting of Tsunamis) stations established in 1995 by the 
                    US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
                    is limited to six, all in the Pacific.<br>
                    <br>
                    Each DART station consists of a seabed pressure-recording 
                    (BPR) unit that detects pressure changes caused by tsunamis 
                    and a surface buoy which receives information transmitted 
                    from the BPR via an acoustic link. The buoy transmits data 
                    to a geostationary satellite, which retransmits the data to 
                    ground stations. An additional 32 DART stations are to be 
                    installed by mid-2007.<br>
                    <br>
                    Satellite-based radar, too, is employed to monitor wave height, 
                    as are GPS-equipped inertia-system buoys.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The movement of an inertia-system buoy in a tsunami 
                    is very different to the movement it would experience if thrown 
                    by waves or even a swell,&#8221; ACM Anuphan said.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;This information is also collected, monitored and used 
                    in the complex computer modeling required to determine if 
                    a tsunami is approaching.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The alert and watching stage &#8211; M7.0 and above &#8211; 
                    will be when evacuation warnings to the public will be given.<br>
                    <br>
                    The information will be disseminated by SMS to Governors, 
                    Vice-Governors, heads of Tam-bon Administration Organizations 
                    (OrBorTor), the police, hospitals and rescue personnel, he 
                    said. It will also be relayed automatically by fax and email.<br>
                    <br>
                    The public will be warned through NDWC-controlled interruption 
                    of television and radio broadcasts, with messages giving the 
                    estimated time of an impending tsunami will strike the coast, 
                    and the sounding of the warning tower sirens.<br>
                    <br>
                    The towers, 18 spread around the major beaches of Phuket and 
                    smaller neighboring islands, but not as yet at Nai Harn Beach, 
                    will broadcast simple messages in Thai, English, German, Japanese 
                    and Chinese. Messages will be broadcast at 127dB, similar 
                    to the volume of a jet airliner at 100 meters, and should 
                    be audible up to 1.5km away.<br>
                    <br>
                    ACM Anuphan said that information will be sent via an INMARSAT 
                    satellite, with hardened backup landlines as a redundancy 
                    measure should INMAR-SAT fail to respond.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;INMARSAT provides telephony and data services to users 
                    worldwide, via digital radios called &#8216;terminals&#8217;. 
                    An INMAR-SAT terminal contacts the satellite and communicates 
                    to a ground station through the satellite.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The system provides reliable communications services to a 
                    range of governments and aid agencies in remote regions, where 
                    there is no reliable terrestrial network, or as a &#8216;redundant&#8217; 
                    method.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;If that fails too, then this is the only situation 
                    in which humans are involved in activating the towers manually. 
                    Manual faxes and SMS would then be sent to chief police officers 
                    and governors of the provinces.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    TIMINGS<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;It will take a maximum of two minutes to send the signal 
                    to the towers and TV and radio stations,&#8221; said ACM Anuphan. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I heard that one governor does not want to cede [to 
                    the NDWC] control of the warnings in his province. He will 
                    be spoken to.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    The Air Chief Marshal said that reconfirmation details would 
                    be sent as and when a clearer picture emerged, adding, &#8220;&#8230;but 
                    this should take place no later than five minutes for email 
                    and SMS and 10 minutes for fax after the initial alert is 
                    given. My best time for sending the reconfirmation alerts 
                    is 90 seconds.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    He stressed that Thailand&#8217;s deep-sea buoys would not 
                    be a first line of defense &#8211; warnings will have been 
                    given of a potential or confirmed tsunami before it reaches 
                    them &#8211; but they would be a tool to confirm or reconfirm 
                    that one is approaching. <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The information they relay will give us 15 minutes&#8217; 
                    warning.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;The NDWC monitors, detects, analyzes and warns,&#8221; 
                    ACM Anuphan said. <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;From that point on it is up to the local authorities 
                    to implement evacuation plans.&#8221;<br>

                      <br>
                      When I was asked to write about the Khao Lak area in the 
                      year after the tsunami, I had mixed feelings. I was directly 
                      affected by the disaster, losing my beloved parents, great 
                      friends and neighbors, my pets, house, car and almost everything 
                      else I owned. I too almost drowned. It has not been pleasant 
                      digging around my post-tsunami memories, especially those 
                      of the months of January to March. Yet there were good times 
                      too, such as the birth of my son Martin in June.<br>
                      <br>
                      This personal account is meant to show the emotional and 
                      psychological recovery a tsunami survivor experiences: it 
                      is not an exercise in self-pity, but a possible aid to understanding 
                      the scope of the tragedy &#8211; and to prove that emotional 
                      recovery is quite possible. I hope it will help readers 
                      who have lost loved ones to gain emotional strength by realizing 
                      that they are not alone.</p>

                        <br>
                        The shock sits deep. I am slowly realizing that Mom and 
                        Dad are not only gone for ever, but that their bodies 
                        may not even be found. I don&#8217;t feel like a survivor, 
                        and am not happy about surviving.<br>
                        <br>
                        My wife &#8220;Lad&#8221;, who is four months pregnant, 
                        and her best friend &#8220;Porn&#8221; also survived &#8211; 
                        they were attending classes at the Rajhabat University 
                        in Phuket that Sunday. It&#8217;s bizarre, but I can&#8217;t 
                        be even grateful for that right now, as there is so much 
                        death, destruction and grieving around me. Out of the 
                        15 people closest to our house, eight are dead, including 
                        Mom and Dad. The death toll in Khao Lak alone has reached 
                        3,000 and keeps rising.<br>
                        <br>
                        Whenever we drive through Khao Lak, on the way to the 
                        temples and hospitals to search for my parents, I have 
                        to weep. I&#8217;m crying a lot these days, even in my 
                        sleep. Our house in Bang Niang is badly damaged, yet most 
                        walls are standing. All the other buildings around us 
                        have been flattened. It&#8217;s like a war zone. I am 
                        too sad and tired to pick up the bits and pieces of our 
                        possessions that have been scattered all round the house. 
                        The feeling is of cold emptiness; I don&#8217;t want anything 
                        any more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Suddenly we find my favorite dog, &#8220;Dickie&#8221;, 
                        wandering through the rubble. I feel happiness for the 
                        first time since the 26th, hugging him and crying like 
                        a baby.<br>
                        <br>
                        We buy a mobile phone in Takuapa so we can be reached. 
                        Friends and relatives contact me after receiving my phone 
                        call for help from the emergency line at Takuapa Hospital, 
                        or after seeing TV interviews with me on Spiegel and Fox; 
                        they called the TV stations to asking for my contact details.<br>
                        <br>
                        An outbreak of water-borne diseases is feared, and I decide 
                        to stop the search for my parents&#8217; remains as it 
                        will be safer for Lad and the unborn child to move to 
                        Phuket. We find shelter at the house of a good friend, 
                        Stefan, after spending one night at a hotel. Then we lose 
                        &#8220;Dickie&#8221; because the management ask us to 
                        put him on a leash outside. In the morning he is gone. 
                        I&#8217;m devastated. Continued searches yield no results.<br>
                        <br>

                        It helps being around friends, and it is great to see 
                        how many people truly care about us. Stefan and his wife 
                        Nud say we can stay as long as we like, but we decide 
                        to get back on our own feet ASAP. Lad finds a house in 
                        Kathu and we decide to rent it until we figure out what 
                        to do next.<br>
                        <br>
                        I try to keep busy and get my paperwork back in order, 
                        as every single document from passport to work permit, 
                        company papers to driving licenses, bankbooks, credit

                        The <em>Gazette</em> asks me to describe my experiences 
                        of December 26 for the newspaper. The feature proves to 
                        be a great help for readers who lost family and friends 
                        in Khao Lak, as they get a detailed description of the 
                        brute force of a tsunami; many now realize that the chances 
                        of survival, especially for children and older people, 
                        were next to none.<br>
                        <br>
                        Many also find it is now time to face the fact that their 
                        parents, brothers, sisters and children who have not been 
                        found alive will likely never return. I receive many readers&#8217; 
                        letters thanking me and the newspaper, and wishing me 
                        all the best.<br>
                        <br>
                        The process of writing about it has helped a lot in the 
                        emotional recovery process. Yet I still find it hard to 
                        get a good night&#8217;s sleep; I have flashbacks and 
                        dream about the tsunami.<br>
                        <br>
                        In some dreams I meet my parents, and it is as if the 
                        disaster had never happened. But then I ask them, &#8220;How 
                        can you be here? That&#8217;s impossible&#8230;&#8221; 
                        And I wake up, angry at myself for not being able to talk 
                        to them properly.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am not in good shape, to say the least. My best friend 
                        Manfred, from Germany, decides to visit us and cheer us 
                        up around my birthday. We stay at a resort in Krabi for 
                        about 10 days, trying to ease the pain of post-tsunami 
                        trauma.<br>

                        We get the reconstruction permit for our house in Bang 
                        Niang. My friend Norbert has provided some space for me 
                        in his property office. Via phone, email and with Manfred&#8217;s 
                        help I manage to sort out most of the legal issues in

                        done, including canceling the rental contract for their 
                        flat and clearing the place out. This requires a trip 
                        to Germany. I&#8217;m horrified at the thought of stepping 
                        into my parents&#8217; home in Witten for the first time 
                        since losing them.<br>

                      <p class="normal1"> All my childhood I lived there. I am worried that my 
                        memories, the smells, colors, photos and other things 
                        will cause an emotional breakdown. I hope for the best 
                        and book the ticket anyway. I do not feel good about this 
                        at all.<br>
                        <br>
                        My kids Stella and Marco back in Germany, who will be 
                        out of school soon, promise to lend me emotional support. 
                        Lad wants to come too, but I feel it would cause her unnecessary 
                        stress &#8211; which would not be good for our unborn 
                        baby. I decide to fly alone.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>March 2005</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        On arrival at Duesseldorf Airport in Germany I&#8217;m 
                        picked up by my ex-wife, who drives me to my uncle&#8217;s 
                        house, where I will stay for the next three weeks. The 
                        next day, I buy a nice pot of flowers for Mom and a large 
                        candle to take home, and I also take a pack of the Thai 
                        cigarettes my Dad loved to smoke so much.<br>
                        <br>
                        I decide to go in alone. The well-known scent, the sound 
                        of the clock in the kitchen&#8230; thousands of memories 
                        flash past in a second. I manage to hold back the tears. 
                        I sit in the kitchen, my parents&#8217; favorite room. 
                        I place a photo of them on the table, beside the flowers, 
                        light the candle and a cigarette for Dad, and say hello. 
                        Tears roll down my cheeks as I talk to them. It is a sad 
                        monologue, yet I feel their presence much stronger here. 
                        When I am more composed, I walk around the flat, trying 
                        to concentrate on what needs to be done.<br>
                        <br>
                        The <em>Bundeskriminalamt</em> (BKA, the Federal Criminal 
                        Police) has been here, taking fingerprints and hair samples 
                        for DNA analysis. They made quite a mess.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have been given a strict deadline from the landlord 
                        for clearing the flat, including complete removal of the 
                        wallpaper and carpets. I am back in Germany, &#8220;Strict 
                        Regulations and No Exceptions Land&#8221;.<br>
                        <br>
                        During the following weeks, my children, former wife, 
                        old classmates and friends help me to get everything done 
                        in time. Calling Lad also helps to keep me focused. The 
                        flowers that I bought start to die, despite being watered, 
                        and it feels as if the presence of my parents has now 
                        gone. I feel very sad.<br>
                        <br>
                        When the flat is<em> besenrein</em> &#8211; &#8220;broom 
                        clean&#8221; &#8211; it is just a cold empty shell. Handing 
                        over the keys to the landlord is easy.<br>

                      <p class="normal1"> At the end of March I receive two phone calls from the 
                        BKA, telling me that my Mom and Dad have been identified, 
                        using dental records. I am relieved and happy that now 
                        we can hold a proper burial ceremony. Many tears are shed 
                        during my three weeks in Germany, but I also have great 
                        times with my friends and my kids. When I board the plane 
                        back home to Thailand, it feels as if a great weight has 
                        been lifted from my shoulders.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>April to November 2005</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        These seven months are best described as the &#8220;healing 
                        phase&#8221;. After the funeral at Wat Phra Thong in Phuket 
                        in early April, we organize a ceremony off Khao Lak to 
                        scatter my parents&#8217; ashes. It is a mixed ceremony, 
                        with both Thai Buddhist and Christian elements.<br>
                        <br>
                        The sun is shining and the sea is as smooth as a mirror. 
                        My parents&#8217; bones and ashes are white like snow; 
                        they shine like stars while sinking to the ocean floor. 
                        As I look at the bright colors of flower petals floating 
                        on the surface, I feel at peace for the first time since 
                        December 26.<br>
                        <br>
                        I know my parents are in a better place now, and that 
                        they wouldn&#8217;t want us to grieve any longer. I gain 
                        much emotional strength that day, and am happy that so 
                        many friends attend the ceremony at Cape Tab Lamru. We 
                        will be able to see the cape from our new home at Saiyoi 
                        Forest, in the hills of southern Khao Lak.<br>
                        <br>
                        From that day on everything improves quickly; business 
                        is up, and with the financial help of friends and family, 
                        we are able to rebuild much of what was lost. The emotional 
                        scars remain, but they will fade in time.<br>
                        <br>
                        I decide that other relatives of victims may be more in 
                        need of help than me, and I write about how to deal with 
                        loss and how to grieve in tsunami-related Khao Lak Internet 
                        forums. This work proves very rewarding.<br>
                        <br>
                        The highlight of the healing phase is the birth of our 
                        son Martin on June 16. In the first few minutes after 
                        he is born, he looks a bit like my Dad; then I recognize 
                        some of my Mom&#8217;s facial expressions. <br>
                        <br>
                        But then everyone says, &#8220;Looks like you, Franky. 
                        Looks like you!&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        It is at this point that I realize there are universal 
                        forces at work, and that nothing really ever ends or dies. 
                        Life feels wonderful again.<br>
                        <br>
                        Emotionally, I am now a much stronger and more stable 
                        person. I am grateful for having survived, and also for 
                        having so many friends out there &#8211; more than I ever 
                        expected. My thanks to all of you for being there when 
                        I needed you the most.<br>

                        and husband Tam upped anchor early in the morning of December 
                        26, 2004, and sailed out of Nai Harn Bay, heading north 
                        for the waters of Burma. <br>
                        <br>
                        It was just about a year since her daughter, her son-in-law 
                        and their three children had all died in a domestic accident, 
                        poisoned by carbon monoxide.<br>
                        <br>
                        What she and Tam saw from their yacht, <em>Temptation</em>, 
                        would only add to Salee&#8217;s gloom.<br>
                        <br>
                        They were just north of the Sarasin Bridge when the tsunami 
                        swept past them. &#8220;We felt a slight swell,&#8221; 
                        Tam explains, &#8220;and then we saw the wave break along 
                        the coast. We thought, &#8216;Wow, that was a big wave&#8217;, 
                        but it wasn&#8217;t exceptional, because the shoreline 
                        there is straight, so it wasn&#8217;t accentuated.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;It was only 20 minutes after that that we got calls 
                        saying, &#8216;Are you alive? A tidal wave has hit Phuket.&#8217; 
                        We decided there was no point in turning around, so we 
                        kept heading north.&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        It was only when they got close to Tab Lamu, where they 
                        planned to drop anchor for the night, that the full horror 
                        was revealed.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;We started seeing all the debris, and suitcases 
                        and pillows, bits of houses and trees, and shortly afterwards 
                        we started to see bodies,&#8221; says Tam.<br>
                        <br>
                        Salee adds, &#8220;We saw a lot of people, 50 or more. 
                        They were all dead. Some spots we couldn&#8217;t go. We 
                        had to stop and push them away before we could go on.&#8221; 
                        She confesses that, with her sadness over her lost family 
                        and then this, she was close to a breakdown.<br>
                        <br>
                        They pushed on and anchored in the fading light of day. 
                        Night fell and the whole coast was pitch black. &#8220;There 
                        was not a single light,&#8221; says Salee.<br>
                        <br>
                        At first light they headed north again. They passed Nang 
                        Tong Beach in Khao Lak. &#8220;It was devastated,&#8221; 
                        says Tam. &#8220;It was wiped out.&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;There was no life &#8211; no boats, no helicopters,&#8221; 
                        says Salee.<br>
                        <br>
                        As the day brightened, however, the signs were there: 
                        &#8220;Off Khao Lak we saw all these bodies in the water, 
                        but the helicopters were over the land,&#8221; Salee says.<br>
                        <br>
                        It was off Koh Phra Tong that they finally came across 
                        life on the water &#8211; faint voices calling for help.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;When we finally located the direction of their 
                        calls for help and we changed our course and went toward 
                        them, the current was very strong and as we got closer, 
                        we had to maneuver around them.&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        The two survivors were a father and son, Olle and Jakob 
                        Fagring from Sweden. They had been clinging to debris 
                        for 26 hours.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tam says, &#8220;When we first brought them onto the boat, 
                        they told us that, since the time they had capsized they 
                        had never seen the sight or sound of any human life.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;There had never been an airplane, or a helicopter 
                        or a boat of any kind for 26 hours. They actually thought 
                        that maybe everything in the world had gone, that they 
                        were the last survivors.&#8221;<br>

                      </table>
                      <p class="normal1"> The two had been staying at a quiet resort on Koh Kor 
                        Khao, just north of Baan Nam Khem, and were out on a long-tail 
                        boat with Olle&#8217;s wife Karen, the couple&#8217;s 
                        older son, Per, and Per&#8217;s girlfriend.<br>
                        <br>
                        The wave hit and Olle and Jakob were flung overboard. 
                        The rest stayed with the boat and rapidly drifted out 
                        of sight.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;A current took them further out to sea. When they 
                        got tired they stopped swimming and just clung to wreckage,&#8221; 
                        says Tam. &#8220;When we picked them out of the water, 
                        they were completely sunburned from the chest up, but 
                        their feet and legs were already hypothermic &#8211; already 
                        blue.&#8221; <br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they would have lived through 
                        the next night,&#8221; Salee remarks. &#8220;The first 
                        thing we did was to give them clothes and water, and some 
                        candy bars. We&#8217;d just filled up the fridge, so we 
                        said, &#8216;Which would you like?&#8217; They took them 
                        all. Every bite they took, they cried. I told them we 
                        were so happy that we could help them.&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;They were on an emotional roller-coaster,&#8221; 
                        says Tam. &#8220;They were so happy to be rescued yet 
                        they were also horrified at the thought they had lost 
                        their family.&#8221; <br>
                        <br>
                        Salee and Tam eventually managed to find a small port 
                        near Kuraburi where they could drop the two, wearing borrowed 
                        clothing and carrying US$200 the Goodmans gave them, along 
                        with a letter Salee wrote for them in Thai, describing 
                        what had happened and who they were, and asking anyone 
                        who read it to help them.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;They said later that letter was like a passport,&#8221; 
                        says Salee. &#8220;Everything they asked for was done, 
                        and that night they discovered the rest of the family 
                        had been rescued and were back at the resort, which had 
                        not been damaged too badly.<br>
                        <br>
                        Why there were not more survivors in the water is a mystery 
                        to Tam and Salee. &#8220;We kept looking and hoping. It 
                        seems like there should have been a lot more.&#8221;<br>
                        <br>
                        But just rescuing the two Swedes was a huge boost for 
                        Salee. &#8220;When I saw those two guys I changed. My 
                        spirits just soared. Just two lives. After all the dead 
                        bodies.&#8221;<br>

                <div align="justify"> 
                  <p class="normal1"> Khao Lak was battered and bruised by the tsunami a year 
                    ago. But in spite of all the anti-Khao Lak and pro-Phuket 
                    politics, next to nothing in government aid and slow bank 
                    loans, the spirit of the Khao Lak people remains unbroken. 
                    It survived and is strong again today because of its people; 
                    they had to fight against all odds, but still refused to buckle 
                    under the pressure. Khao Lak is a big family, and no one can 
                    take that away from us. Here&#8217;s a diary of the past year 
                    in the battling town I now call my home.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>End of December 2004:</strong> The local people, along 
                    with dive-shop staff, are the heroes of the moment. Immediate 
                    rescue efforts are saving hundreds of lives. The roads are 
                    being cleared as much as bare hands can manage, enabling the 
                    injured to be taken to Takuapa and Thai Muang. <br>
                    <br>
                    Temporary shelters and makeshift first aid stations are everywhere. 
                    Volunteers and other rescuers work day and night. There is 
                    a minor police presence; nobody really knows what is going 
                    on.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are constant rumors about more tsunamis on the way. 
                    Many people are staying in the mountains without food or water 
                    because they fear another hit. Looters stoke the panic by 
                    spreading gossip that more waves are coming.<br>
                    <br>
                    While local people engage in first aid and collect the dead, 
                    outsiders are moving in with profit in mind, searching the 
                    clothing of corpses along the road for valuables.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, the army and police get a grip on the situation, 
                    but by then it is too late; any valuables have already disappeared. 
                    The Royal Thai Army does a fine job clearing roads to aid 
                    the search for and recovery of bodies, which are taken in 
                    trucks to nearby Buddhist temples.<br>
                    <br>
                    The temples are unable to cope with the constantly rising 
                    number of corpses. Volunteers try to slow the decomposition 
                    process, using dry ice. The victims are photographed and tagged 
                    with identification codes. This should help relatives to identify 
                    lost loved ones, but in fact it just causes more confusion 
                    &#8211; because the faces of most victims have become unidentifiable, 
                    being black and swollen. <br>
                    <br>
                    After Day Two it is not even possible to distinguish between 
                    Thai and foreigner. DNA samples are taken from relatives to 
                    support the identification process.<br>
                    <br>
                    Two stranded dolphins and a dugong are rescued alive from 
                    the Khao Lak reservoir. They are inoculated and returned to 
                    the sea. Even this one ray of hope cannot disguise the fact 
                    that Thailand faces its saddest New Year in history.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>January 2005: </strong>Clean-up efforts begin in earnest. 
                    Bang Niang beach is the first to be cleared. Severely damaged 
                    structures are demolished, and bodies are still being found. 
                    The search teams decide to pump all the water from the reservoir 
                    at Bang Niang. More than 250 bodies have been recovered from 
                    there so far, including the drowned passengers from a large 
                    tour bus. <br>
                    <br>
                    International Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams arrive 
                    in Thai Muang to aid in the process of identifying bodies.<br>
                    <br>
                    Many people hope that their relatives will be identified quickly 
                    now, but with a death toll of 5,000 and rising, the chances 
                    of speedy closure are reduced. <br>
                    <br>
                    A bizarre kind of tsunami tourism starts, which does Khao 
                    Lak no good at all. Buses from Phuket arrive, and I get reports 
                    about a Japanese tourist posing beside a truck full of victims&#8217; 
                    bodies for a &#8220;Kodak moment&#8221;. He is seen making 
                    the Victory sign. Luckily I did not see this, as I would have 
                    knocked him out on the spot.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>February 2005:</strong> Huge trucks bring in load 
                    after load of soil while heavy machinery works to replace 
                    lost stretches of shoreline and remodel the washed-away beaches.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the larger resorts are granted reconstruction loans 
                    by banks, only to be told that the money will be made available 
                    &#8220;later this year&#8221;. Small businesses and small 
                    family resorts are left to their own devices. <br>
                    <br>
                    Small and medium enterprises in Bang Niang unite, the goal 
                    being to rebuild as many bungalows as possible in the shortest 
                    possible time to help revive the area. Despite the massive 
                    loss of life, the spirit of the surviving business people 
                    and residents remains unbroken.<br>
                    <br>
                    With just a few exceptions, most residents have returned to 
                    build a new future, and that also means a new Khao Lak. An 
                    unbelievable 26 resorts are operational again, five of them 
                    right on the beaches.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>March 2005: </strong>In the middle of the night of 
                    March 28, an earthquake registering 8.7 on the Richter Scale 
                    rocks northern Sumatra. There is panic, which is quite understandable. 
                    The combined and immediate efforts of police, army and volunteers 
                    to evacuate potential danger areas of Khao Lak prove successful, 
                    with hundreds of people arriving in safe zones just minutes 
                    after the first warning is issued. Luckily, the feared tsunami 
                    does not happen.<br>
                    <br>
                    On February 19, a definite &#8220;go&#8221; for reconstruction 
                    is issued by the government. Countless foreign volunteers 
                    are helping to rebuild resorts, homes and shelters all around 
                    Khao Lak &#8211; while at the same time being threatened with 
                    dire penalties by the Employment Services Office should they 
                    fail to obtain work permits. In fact, nothing happens.<br>
                    <br>
                    Most local tsunami victims will have to rebuild their lives 
                    and businesses using the maximum financial government help 
                    of 20,000 baht per person. Rain starts to fall in March, and 
                    everyone hopes that vegetation will soon cover the scarred 
                    dry red soil in the affected areas. In mid-March, the Bang 
                    Niang beach area is still without power.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>April to November 2005:</strong> Many survivors, relatives 
                    and friends of tsunami victims find a sense of relief and 
                    closure during the Khao Lak 100 days Tsunami Memorial Festival, 
                    a three-day event from April 2-4 that transforms the community.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Ministry of Public Health opens the Mental Health Recovery 
                    Center in Khao Lak on May 26 to help tsunami victims recovering 
                    from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression. It is 
                    long overdue, but better late than never.<br>
                    <br>
                    Reconstruction efforts continue everywhere and, in late June, 
                    most of the promised bank loans are paid and the bigger players 
                    really start to rock the boat. It is now becoming obvious 
                    that Khao Lak is not only on the way back, it will perhaps 
                    emerge from this ordeal stronger than ever.<br>
                    <br>
                    The message is clear, and it floods in from lovers of Khao 
                    Lak all over the world, in emails, on Internet forums and 
                    in phone calls: &#8220;We will come back!&#8221;<br>

              <div align="justify"> 
                <div align="justify"> 
                  <p class="normal1"> Krabi was in a unique position immediately after the tsunami 
                    as the mainland escaped the heavy damage, destruction and 
                    loss of life that the province&#8217;s islands sustained. 
                    As a result, the provincial center of Krabi Town was able 
                    to react quickly to provide aid to those areas that had experienced 
                    the greatest devastation.<br>
                    <br>
                    The best-known island group, and the one most exposed to the 
                    tsunami, was Phi Phi: the densely populated section of Ton 
                    Sai Bay on Phi Phi Don sustained massive damage and suffered 
                    the highest proportion of fatalities and casualties in the 
                    province.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Phi Phi Islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Ao 
                    Nang Tambon Administration Organization (OrBorTor), and Ao 
                    Nang Beach became the focal point for rescue and evacuation 
                    operations for the people of Phi Phi and surrounding islands.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ao Nang Beach itself was in relatively good condition, mainly 
                    because it was protected from the waves by many of the outer 
                    islands. Its sea wall also minimized the amount of damage 
                    to beach-front properties.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ao Nang beachfront was therefore suitable as the staging point 
                    for operations, with the beach road closed to facilitate the 
                    movement of emergency vehicles.<br>
                    <br>
                    Since the mainland infrastructure was relatively unscathed, 
                    the resources of the Krabi Municipality reacted in full force, 
                    aiding the victims from the other islands and areas affected 
                    by the tsunami. Krabi Hospital was soon packed to capacity, 
                    however, and the Chinese temple in Krabi Town was quickly 
                    converted into a temporary morgue.<br>
                    <br>
                    Krabi Town was one of the quickest to respond to the reconstruction 
                    and relaunching of long-tail boats. Haad Nopporat Thara Beach 
                    was set up as a building site, using the concrete blocks and 
                    broken construction materials from the unfinished seawall 
                    as building platforms.<br>
                    <br>
                    Volunteer students and scuba divers also helped the operators 
                    of a large crane that pulled hundreds of boats out of the 
                    bay.<br>
                    <br>
                    With government aid, funds from large international foundations 
                    and private donations, the mayor put together a team to co-ordinate 
                    these activities. The first aim was to identify properly registered 
                    boats, and to try to discourage any fraudulent claims.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once the boat owners had been verified, construction needs 
                    were recorded, materials purchased and even volunteer mechanics 
                    arranged to repair engines.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Krabi Town, foreign volunteers living in the province rushed 
                    to Krabi Hospital and the morgue, providing translation services 
                    for families trying to locate their loved ones.<br>
                    <br>
                    Almost all of the Thai residents of Phi Phi were relocated 
                    into two areas of Krabi Town, Klong Hin and Nong Kok. Various 
                    relief agencies provided food and support, helping the survivors 
                    move into their new homes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Help International Phi Phi &#8211; HiPhiPhi &#8211; under 
                    the leadership of Dutch national Emiel Kok, was instrumental 
                    in cataloging and identifying the children who had lost family 
                    members and parents.<br>
                    <br>
                    This group provided much-needed resources, and acted as a 
                    bridge between the activities on Phi Phi Island and the relocation 
                    centers in Krabi Town.<br>
                    <br>
                    HiPhiPhi later handed responsibility for sponsorship of the 
                    children to the Sriphong Phuk-aoluan Foundation (www. krabirelief.com). 
                    This foundation has taken on the task of monitoring and supporting 
                    child victims of the tsunami until they reach the age of 18.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Chuan Phukaoluan, President of the Foundation, states, 
                    &#8220;Both the public and private sectors did some great 
                    work after the tsunami, but now it is [the foundation&#8217;s] 
                    job to deal with the long-term effects of the tsunami, relating 
                    to unemployment and job creation, education of the children 
                    and continued medical care for the victims.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Restabilizing the community torn apart by the catastrophe 
                    has been a priority. Relocation of the children to different 
                    school districts solved one problem &#8211; the over-burdening 
                    of one school with too many new students &#8211; but at the 
                    same time it also separated children from their friends, families 
                    and support systems.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unemployment skyrocketed as the tourism industry slumped, 
                    and most tourist-related businesses reduced staff levels by 
                    as much as half. In response, several different groups and 
                    foundations became active in reuniting the communities and 
                    providing support for occupational training.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Aree Foundation, as well as Tex&#8217;s Rock Climbing, 
                    have worked hard to provide assets to help establish a safety 
                    net. For instance, while the initial rebuilding of the long-tail 
                    boats was considered a success, it soon became apparent that 
                    because of the slowdown in tourist arrivals, the boatmen were 
                    still facing economic ruin. Private donors, along with the 
                    local foundations, helped to refit many of these boats as 
                    fishing boats to enable the owners to earn some income.<br>
                    <br>
                    The revival of tourism will help solve some of the problems 
                    faced by the tsunami-affected families and children. <br>
                    <br>
                    Key to many tourists is the feeling of safety, that there 
                    is no chance of being surprised by a natural disaster as many 
                    were on that morning of last December 26.<br>
                    <br>
                    The government understands this issue, and has been setting 
                    up a tsunami-warning system in Krabi Province. In total there 
                    are 35 sirens throughout the province, including at Koh Lanta, 
                    Ao Luek, Koh Phi Phi and Nuea Klong. <br>
                    <br>
                    In September, the Governor of Krabi oversaw the implementation 
                    of the early-warning alarm system in Ao Nang. Evacuation routes 
                    were established and meeting areas designated. A drill on 
                    September 23 saw a large turn-out of residents and rescue 
                    personnel.<br>
                    <br>
                    A visit to most areas of Krabi Province finds the infrastructure 
                    intact, businesses open and the hotels 100% ready to accept 
                    tourists. <br>
                    <br>
                    The rebound in tourism will play a vital role in reducing 
                    unemployment and making many of the affected families self-sufficient 
                    again. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the meantime, many organizations are providing assistance 
                    to aid those children and others still needing help until 
                    the community can be restabilized.<br>

                    is what it&#8217;s like to drown&#8217;.&#8221;</em><br>
                    <br>
                    When the tsunami struck Koh Phi Phi Don, Blackpool-born Claire 
                    Lester was enjoying Day 3 of her family&#8217;s first Christmas 
                    holiday together outside England. The Lesters had rented a 
                    row of five bungalows at the PP Princess Diving &amp; Spa 
                    Resort, a few meters from the beach.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;We&#8217;d always spent Christmas in England, but with 
                    me living on Phuket, it was a chance for us to share a special 
                    holiday in tropical paradise,&#8221; says Claire, an art teacher 
                    at the British Curriculum International School (BCIS).<br>
                    <br>
                    Her father, Keith, her older brother, Adrian, and her older 
                    sister, Amanda, all died in the tsunami. Claire survived, 
                    along with her mother, Barbara, her younger brother James, 
                    his partner Lucy Haylock and Claire&#8217;s partner, Surin

                    <br>
                    &#8220;The couple of days we had on Phi Phi as a family were 
                    wonderful. We were getting along famously and enjoying being 
                    together&#8230; I miss my father, bro-ther and sister so much. 
                    The pain never goes away, but you can do things to make it 
                    easier to bear. Although I still work hard, I &#8216;play&#8217; 
                    harder than before. I am thankful to be alive.<br>

                    &#8220;Survivors of the tsunami know what it&#8217;s like 
                    to be drowning &#8211; to hear and feel the indescribable 
                    noise of the sea,&#8221; Claire says. &#8220;After going through 
                    that, I&#8217;ve become aware of my own mortality. The experience 
                    brought home to me the importance of family and the brevity

                    a loved one, make sure you do, because you don&#8217;t want 
                    to be left with regret. Your whole life can change in one 
                    second.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    While Lucy was taken to Mission Hospital in Phuket, most of 
                    Koh Phi Phi Don&#8217;s victims were sent to Krabi within 
                    48 hours.<br>
                    <br>
                    Claire commends the quality of care at Krabi Hospital. &#8220;The 
                    staff was really well organized. We were cleaned, given wristbands 
                    indicating the extent of our injuries and taken to different 
                    areas for treatment.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    With the sudden influx of patients requiring procedures, there 
                    weren&#8217;t enough operating rooms available, but Claire&#8217;s 
                    four severed tendons in her right foot needed urgent surgery. 
                    It was performed in the emergency room under local anesthesia.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I was told there weren&#8217;t enough resources to 
                    cope. It was okay with me; I still didn&#8217;t feel any pain 
                    in my leg or foot. The operation was over quickly and my leg 
                    was put in a cast.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    On December 30, Claire, Barbara, James and Lucy were taken 
                    to Bumrungrad Hospital, Bangkok, by helicopter for further 
                    treatment. Their lacerations &#8211; first immersed in dirty 
                    water, then exposed for several hours &#8211; had become infected. 
                    Claire&#8217;s leg was swollen and required two more operations. 
                    K. Rin followed on.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Bangkok, the British Ambassador and his wife visited regularly, 
                    bringing scones and other favorites to lift their spirits. 
                    They discussed the effectiveness of the British Embassy&#8217;s 
                    emergency response.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Lesters returned to Phuket in February. That month and 
                    the next, Claire and James received daily physiotherapy sessions 
                    at Bangkok-Phuket Hospital. Barbara, James, K. Rin and Claire 
                    also received trauma and grief counseling.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then, they flew to England with the bodies of Claire&#8217;s 
                    older siblings.<br>
                    <br>
                    On an April day in Black-pool, the Lesters held a memorial 
                    service which celebrated the lives of Claire&#8217;s older 
                    siblings and her father, who was still missing.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;My physical wounds had healed sufficiently for me to 
                    confront the emotional aspect,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I had 
                    to ask myself if I wanted to continue living on Phuket.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    She embarked upon what would be a slow but steady journey 
                    to full recovery. Claire decided to go back to work. &#8220;That 
                    helped me make up my mind to stay in Phuket. It is my home 
                    now.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Claire&#8217;s mother, James and Lucy traveled with her to 
                    Phuket once again, staying with her for two weeks in May.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then, just two days after Barbara, James and Lucy had flown 
                    back to England, Keith&#8217;s body was identified. Claire 
                    accompanied her father&#8217;s body back to England.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Lesters played a key role in a memorial service for tsunami 
                    victims attended by the Cabinet and the Queen in Lon-don&#8217;s 
                    St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral. &#8220;My mother and I led one 
                    part of the ceremony called &#8216;act of remembrance&#8217;, 
                    leading the procession of representative families down the 
                    center aisle to lay flowers on the altar,&#8221; she says.<br>
                    <br>
                    They were also invited to meet several VIPs, including British 
                    Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and 
                    Prince Charles, who wanted to hear what they had to say about 
                    improving disaster recovery operations.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;Prince Charles was genuinely interested in the Clean 
                    Up the World Day event I helped organize at Kamala Beach in 
                    September,&#8221; says Claire.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is Claire&#8217;s fourth year in her job at BCIS as an 
                    art teacher and Creativity Action and Service group (CAS) 
                    Co-ordinator. Clean Up the World Day 2005, organized by 13 
                    International Baccalaureate students as part of the CAS program, 
                    was very meaningful for Claire. It was the first time, since 
                    the tsunami, she was on a beach for longer than 30 minutes. 
                    She carried on, despite a heavy storm that raged throughout 
                    the day.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I can sit on a beach and feel at ease again,&#8221; 
                    she says. &#8220;It helped me conquer my fear; I have been 
                    on a speedboat and swum in the sea &#8211; things I thought 
                    I could never bring myself to do again. The more that I face 
                    my fears, the easier it becomes.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Just working and maintaining a daily routine has proved beneficial, 
                    says Claire, who returned to work again full time in August 
                    &#8211; eight months after the tsunami.<br>
                    <br>
                    Her family and friends began to help tsunami victims by initiating 
                    fund-raising drives in England. Their efforts garnered some 
                    214,000 baht (3,000 pounds sterling) &#8211; presented to 
                    Krabi Hospital in May, to buy a badly needed portable ultrasound 
                    scanner.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the PP Princess and PP Charlie Tsunami Relief Fund, they 
                    raised more than 185,000 baht. The PP Princess Diving &amp; 
                    Spa Resort lost more than 100 foreign guests to the tsunami 
                    and some 30 staff members who left behind more than 20 orphans.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Lesters also helped two Blackpool area schools raise money 
                    for Phuket&#8217;s Life Home Project, the shelter for mothers 
                    and their children who are HIV positive or have AIDS.<br>
                    <br>
                    Claire continues to receive support from regular counseling 
                    at Bangkok-Phuket Hospital and a counseling group at Surin 
                    Beach Resort &#8211; Tsunami Victims Aid Initiative.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;Flashbacks don&#8217;t just disappear,&#8221; she says. 
                    &#8220;There are people who, although not physically affected 
                    by the tsunami, were affected mentally and the anniversary 
                    will bring this trauma out. For me, it serves as a constant 
                    reminder to enjoy life to the fullest. Living here, I have 
                    been able to face my fears straight away. I think it has been 
                    harder for my mother and my brother in England to come to 
                    terms with everything.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Warned that the injuries she had sustained might prevent her 
                    from walking normally again, she took it as a challenge to 
                    refortify her mind and body.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;They told me in hospital, &#8216;You&#8217;re not going 
                    to be able to do anything for six months; you probably aren&#8217;t 
                    going to be able to walk properly.&#8217; That was a big issue 
                    for me,&#8221; Claire says, &#8220;but now I do yoga, tap 
                    dancing and Thai kick-boxing.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;It feels good to get back into tap dancing, which I 
                    started when I was about four. It really gets my circulation 
                    going. The exercise, plus physiotherapy, has gone a long way 
                    to healing my leg and improving my mobility.&#8221;<br>
                    <br>
                    Since the tsunami, Claire&#8217;s interest in holistic medicine 
                    has grown. &#8220;Before the new school year, I did a 10-day 
                    fast on Koh Samui. I started cranial sacral therapy, too, 
                    as I had been feeling tired and emotional with the build-up 
                    to the anniversary. Focused on healing, I also had reiki and 
                    acupuncture for my leg.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#8220;I believe in using anything you can find to make the 
                    day easier, or to get through something. It doesn&#8217;t 
                    matter what it is. For me, it&#8217;s these.&#8221;<br>

                  <p class="normal1"> The full impact of the tsunami on the economy of Phuket 
                    is not easy to assess. But what is plain is that, because 
                    the disaster happened early in the tourist season, it severely 
                    limited the income that would normally have been earned during 
                    this period. In addition, much of the structural damage sustained 
                    was, in many cases, uninsured.<br>
                    <br>
                    The tourist season is the main income period for many business 
                    owners and individuals on the island; to have an event such 
                    as this happen so early in the season increased the financial 
                    damage considerably.<br>
                    <br>
                    It can be assumed that the financial damage from the tsunami 
                    was mostly felt by hotels, bars, dive companies, car hire 
                    companies, and other tourism-related businesses. In reality, 
                    the damage was more widespread.<br>
                    <br>
                    A simple example of this might be a car salesman working for 
                    a dealership in Phuket City. He is not directly effected by 
                    the tsunami, but the company he works for finds that sales 
                    have slumped and he is made redundant. He may have been on 
                    the verge of having a house built and was also going to buy 
                    furniture. So the loss extends to the builder and furniture 
                    shops.<br>
                    <br>
                    The knock-on effect was felt through a substantial part of 
                    Phuket&#8217;s economy. Turnover in, say, Central Festival 
                    shopping center was severely reduced because local people 
                    found themselves in straitened circumstances, in addition 
                    to the absence of the normal number of tourists. <br>
                    <br>
                    Phuket, as a tourist destination, is to a great extent dependent 
                    on image. Most tourists seek sun and sand, a getaway from 
                    the monotony of everyday living and commuting in chilly, gray 
                    cities. In particular, Phuket&#8217;s tourist season coincides 
                    with the northern hemisphere&#8217;s most unpleasant weather.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, the image of a tropical paradise is shattered when 
                    scenes of devastation and massive loss of life suddenly appear 
                    on potential tourists&#8217; TV screens. It jars with what 
                    the average tourist is seeking in a holiday destination.<br>
                    <br>
                    Often, anecdotal information is interesting in such situations. 
                    A friend who lost his diving job because of the tsunami took 
                    a six-month holiday to New Zealand. In Auckland he went to 
                    a travel agency in July to reconfirm airline tickets to Phuket, 
                    only to hear the travel agent advise a local couple that a 
                    holiday to Phuket was out of the question. &#8220;The place 
                    is devastated,&#8221; he heard.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, as every politician in the world is aware, public 
                    memory is short and many people are better informed than the 
                    travel agent in New Zealand. <br>
                    <br>
                    A married couple I know tried to get a room at Amanpuri in 
                    September, only to be told that it was fully booked. Determined 
                    to visit Phuket for the first time, they ended up renting 
                    an Aman-puri villa, complete with five bedrooms and two swimming 
                    pools, just for themselves!<br>
                    <br>
                    What does the future hold for Phuket? It promises to be exceptional; 
                    the fact is that there is a limited number of tropical island 
                    destinations in the world. <br>
                    <br>
                    Combine this with the fact that now there are more affluent 
                    people in the world than ever before, plus the increasing 
                    ease of travel and ever-improving amenities and communications 
                    and the result is that more and more people are traveling.<br>
                    <br>
                    Phuket also caters to a wide variety of tourists, not only 
                    in terms of many nationalities but also in terms of different 
                    income groups. <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to &#8220;normal&#8221; tourism, there are those 
                    who are seeking vacation and retirement homes. The number 
                    of new developments under construction on this island reflects 
                    just how large the market is.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, new marinas are in evidence all over; this is 
                    a very welcome addition, as boat owners have to spend money. 
                    The old definition of a yacht is &#8220;a hole in the sea 
                    that you fill with money&#8221;; a new definition of &#8220;boat&#8221; 
                    is &#8220;bring out another thousand&#8221;.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am told by those in the industry that hotel reservations 
                    are excellent for the rest of the season. <br>
                    <br>
                    One minor drag on the budget tourist sector may be that the 
                    increase in fuel prices adds to airfares. On the other hand, 
                    the Japanese economy is showing strong signs of recovery and, 
                    for the first time in 15 years, this is not an export-led 
                    blip; domestic Japanese spending is now on track &#8211; and 
                    that means tourism.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the tourist who wishes to have a safe vacation in Phuket, 
                    the real risk is not another tsunami but renting a motorcycle. 
                    I take my boat to sea without a second thought, but wild horses 
                    could not drag me onto a motorcycle.<br>
