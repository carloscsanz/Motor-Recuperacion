<a name="announcement"><h2>[Announcement of the first release of ICOT Free Software]</h2></a>
    Of the 71 ICOT Free Software programs, 43 programs will be released on
7th August.  These are obtainable through Anonymous FTP from our ftp-
server machine (ftp.icot.or.jp) at ICOT.  Note that, only ftp access from
oversea is available now.
<pre>
        ===========================================================
        You are not allowed to access ftp-server from inside Japan
        until the preparation of the domestic server is completed.  
        The server will be prepared by the beginning of September.  
        ===========================================================
</pre>
Persons in Japan wanting to get the software earlier than this date are
requested to come to ICOT to copy it by themselves.

    By the end of August, almost all of the 71 programs will be released.
