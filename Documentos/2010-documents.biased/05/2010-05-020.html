    <img src="images/final_alfred.jpg" alt="Alfred Spector" />
    <h4>Alfred Spector, VP of Research and Special Initiatives</h4>
    <p>Alfred joined Google in November of 2007 and is responsible for the research across Google and also a growing collection of special initiatives - typically projects with high strategic value to the company, but somewhat outside the mainstream of current products.</p>
    <p>Previously, Alfred was Vice President of Strategy and Technology for IBM’s Software Business. Prior to that, he was Vice President of Services and Software Research across IBM. He was also founder and CEO of Transarc Corporation, a pioneer in distributed transaction processing and wide-area file systems, and was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in highly reliable and scalable distributed computing.</p>
    <p>Alfred received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford and his AB
    in Applied Mathematics from Harvard. He is a member of the National
    Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the IEEE and ACM, and the
    recipient of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society’s Tsutomu Kanai Award for
    work in scalable architectures and distributed systems.</p>

    <h4>Jeff Dean, Google Fellow</h4>
    <p>
      Jeff joined Google in 1999 and is currently a Google Fellow working in
      the Systems Infrastructure Group. Jeff has designed and implemented
      large portions of the company’s advertising, crawling, indexing and
      query serving systems, along with various pieces of the distributed
      computing infrastructure that underlying most of Google’s products. At
      various times, Jeff has also worked on improving search quality,
      statistical machine translation, and various internal software
      development tools. He has had significant involvement in the
      engineering hiring process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to joining Google, Jeff was at DEC/Compaq’s Western Research
      Laboratory, where he worked on profiling tools, microprocessor
      architecture, and information retrieval. Earlier, he worked at the
      World Health Organization’s Global Programme on AIDS, developing
      software for statistical modeling and forecasting of the HIV/AIDS
      pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff is an author of more than 20 publications and a co-inventor on
      more than 25 patents. He earned a B.S. in Computer Science and
      Economics (summa cum laude) from the University of Minnesota and
      received his MS and PhD in computer science from the University of
      Washington.

    <h4>Amit Singhal, Google Fellow</h4>
    <p>
      Amit Singhal has worked in the field of search for over fifteen years,
      first as an academic researcher and now as Google engineer. His
      research interests include information retrieval, its application to
      web search, web graph analysis, and user interfaces for search. At
      Google, Amit works with the Search Quality team, the team responsible
      for Google’s search algorithms. Prior to joining Google in 2000, Amit
      was a senior member of technical staff at AT&amp;T Labs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amit has an undergraduate degree in India from IIT, Roorkee, a MS from
      the University of Minnesota and a PhD from Cornell University, all in
      Computer Science. At Cornell, he studied Information Retrieval with
      the late Gerard Salton, one of the founders of the field. Amit has
      co-authored more than thirty scientific papers and numerous patents.
