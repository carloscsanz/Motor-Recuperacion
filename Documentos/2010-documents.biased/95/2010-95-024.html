  Here are my specs:<br />9800 GTX<br />EVGA 790i Ultra board<br />2x2gb 1600mhz 7-7-7-20 -- OCZ3P16002GK<br />Antec EA 650watt power supply<br />E8400 CPU<br />2 36gb raptors in a raid 0  OS drive with Windows XP<br />1 400 gb ide hd, not sure of make just a storage drive for movies<br />1 DVD RW on a SATA<br /><br />I have been getting random freezes while playing World of Warcraft, Crysis, and Medal of Honor.  Each is a little different and all of them are drivng me nuts<br /><br />With WoW, it happens randomly.  Sometime it happens after a few minutes, sometimes after a few hours, doesn&#39;t seem to really have a pattern.  Temps on the card are at about 50-55 C and not really moving to much from what i can tell (have been hoping in and out of game to see how hot I can get it)<br /><br />With Crysis it is a little different.  If i start a game with AA above the lowest setting it instantly crashes.  Just hard freezes and nothing I can do but hit the restart.  Other than that it has worked pretty solid but have not put in a lot of test time yet.<br /><br />Medal of Honor crashed 2 or 3 times on me in the initial jump scene, but otherwise played fine, but I have not played it a ton to test it.<br /><br />Warcraft is my main game and it is very random.  I have tried reinstalling drivers including using a clean wipe to do so.  THis is all on a clean install of xp with all patches installed.  I have updated my bios, and made sure all of the drivers for the motherboard are up to date as well.  <br /><br />I am out of ideas....anyone have anything I might try?<br /><br />Oh memtest ran clear and sometimes I get a crash in 3dmark06 but only sometimes...not sure why.

  I&#39;ve been having this same problem with WoW on my 9800GTX. I also experienced an identical issue when playing the Crysis demo. I have (so far) seen no crashes in Assassin&#39;s Creed, Source (HL2, CSS, TF2, Portal), Oblivion, or Bioshock.<br /><br />I have tried the approved nVidia drivers (174.74 and 175.16) as well as the latest beta drivers (175.70). The crash occurs under all drivers.<br /><br />I have found that I can cause the crash to happen much faster (almost immediately after logging into a character) by enabling forced Super-Sampling in the Anti-Aliasing options from the nVidia control panel.<br /><br />I&#39;ve run extensive memory tests and carefully monitored the system temperature with no problems. I have disabled sound in WoW, in Windows, and even from the BIOS, and the problem persists.<br /><br />[CPU] Intel Yorkfield 9450 Core2 Quad @ 2.66Ghz (stock)<br />[CPU COOLING] Zalman CNPS 9700<br />[MB] EVGA nForce 790i Ultra SLI<br />[OS] Windows Vista Home Premium 64bit<br />[GPU] BFG 9800GTX 512MB<br />[Sound] Onboard<br />[RAM] 4GB (2x2) Patriot Viper PC10666 @ 1333MHz (7-7-7-20 1T) (stock) <br />[HDD] WD Raptor SATA 16MB Buffer 150GB<br />[PSU] Antec TruPower 650w<br />[Case] Antec 900

  I&#39;m having the same problems (but am only playing Call of Duty 4).  The video and framerates are all great, but it just seems to lock up.<br /><br />I&#39;ve come up with one possible idea after crawling the internet for clues -- it seems that the card may be heating up (but not overheating itself), and since it sits directly over the nForce 400 chip, over heats IT.  It them locks the system as a safe guard from the chip overheating and doing damage.<br /><br />I&#39;ve put in a ticket on XFX&#39;s site, and they told me to re-install drivers (like I haven&#39;t tried that yet).<br /><br />What does seem to help is me opening my case and putting the computer directly under the vent from my A/C.  I ran it last night for several hours without incident.  I put the case back on and within minutes it locked up.<br /><br />Definitely seems to be a cooling issue (again, temps on the card itself were fine).<br /><br />My System Specs<br />--------------------<br />Intel Quad Core Q9300 - 2.5 GHZ<br />XFX GF 9800GTX 675M 512MB DDR3 DUAL DVI TV<br />Asus Socket 775 SLI P5N-T Deluxe<br />2 x 2 GB DDR2-800 PC2-6400 KINGSTON<br />Antec True Power Trio TP3-650 650W ATX12V Power Supply with Three 12V Rails<br />Microsoft Vista Premium 32 Bit

  ya it definetly has to do with cooling, i have 2 9800gx2s in a custom built pc and i cant even play counter strike without it heating up too much and freezing IF i have the case on so I have a small box fan blowing on it which cools it down and i can play, the problem is the small box fan can not possibly cool it enough when playing high demanding games like Crysis. I dont know anything about water cooling and I was wondering if there is something that is designed to cool down these cards, i dont even mind if i have to have a fan blowing on them like i do now I just need colder air to blow on it

  Yes I noticed that the temperature in the room became unusually warm from the computer but the NVidia system monitor showed that they were still within safe limits at the time of the crashes.

  I&#39;m not confident that the issue is heat-related. The idea of the South Bridge overheating was raised by one of my co-workers, but checking inside the case I see that not only does the heat sync extend well beyond the area covered by the Graphics Card, there is considerable clearance (I&#39;d estimate at least 1/2 an inch) and airflow from the case fans in the empty center drive bay compartment.<br /><br />Heat issues should not be so inconsistent, either. I can play Assassin&#39;s Creed for 10 hours straight without a hitch but WoW locks up within 10-30 minutes usually.<br /><br />The current solution that seems to be working for me is increasing the voltage and loosening the memory timing beyond the rated spec. While I&#39;m not happy to be doing so, it seems to make a considerable difference. Only time will tell if its a real fix or if luck of the draw has fooled me.

  A couple of ideas have been brought up and I just want to sum them all up.<br /><br />1. Heat-  this is always a possibility but with WoW not pushing a system very hard it doesn&#39;t make sense that it would freeze a system but a first person shooter would not.  Just doesn&#39;t make sense.<br /><br />2. Power-  From what I have read in review articles from places like Tom&#39;s Hardware the system does not need nearly as much power as most people are prepping for.  Most systems will only use about 300w under load with a 9800GTX.<br /><br />3. Memory Timings-  I think this might be part of it, but I don&#39;t see how a system would pass Memtest but not be able to play a game if the problem is Memory TImings.  I have tried Prime95, Memtest, and used the ATItool and all passed with 0 errors after 8 or so hours of testing.   I just don&#39;t get how the tests pass but the game fails...very odd.<br /><br />4. Drivers --  I think this is really the heart of it, but wish there was a better way to test it.  Is there a driver tester out there that can stress test drivers?<br /><br />Just wanted to sum up everything everyone brought up so we cvan keep things going to finding an answer for some people.  Also I really think the drivers are really broken with the AA and Super sampling areas.  That seems to be what pushes the card to crash fast.<br /><br />Oh well, good luck to everyone on it.<br /><br />J<br />

  I finally received a 2nd response from XFX (after opening a trouble ticket with them).  They suggested I RMA the card so they can replace it.  I&#39;m very surprised they were so quick to jump to the RMA solution.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but I&#39;m really not convinced just sending it back and getting another would really help.  I&#39;d like to actually <b>know</b> what the problem is before I do that.<br /><br />I know this sounds stupid, but I&#39;m thinking of routing a duct from my A/C directly to my computer, close the case and see what happens...<br /><br />Question:  Does anyone know how to tell the temps of your card/mobo WHILE you&#39;re playing the games?

  Hi everyone,<br /><br />I had similar issues with my PC locking up randomly - not even in games mind you...  just randomly a few times a day <!--emo&:/--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/blarg.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='blarg.gif' /><!--endemo--><br /><br />my specs:<br /><br />cpu - Q9450<br />cooler - Thermaltake IFX-14<br />ram - 2x2GB Corsair XMS3 1600 7-7-7-20 rated<br />mobo - asus striker II extreme<br />gpu - bfg 9800gtx (driver 175.16)<br />power - coolermaster 1kw<br />os - vista 64 SP1<br /><br /><br />I had random lockups - even when i was underclocking ram and cpu to try and find some stability.  My windows installation was borked up once on bootup when I had a blue screen as well - causing me to have to do a reinstall... various system files were corrupted.  I am not sure if this is an acknowledged issue with other 790i chipset boards, but the asus striker 2 extreme is known to cause some corruption if you you hit a rough patch <!--emo&:/--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/blarg.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='blarg.gif' /><!--endemo-->  definitely quite irritating and distressing - especially when we are paying top &lt;insert currency here&gt; for supposedly performance parts&#33;<br /><br />The latest version of my motherboard bios however seems to have fixed everything up sweet (i am using version 0603) and I have had no issues whatsoever since flashing that version.  VERY relieved let me tell you <!--emo&:/--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/blarg.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='blarg.gif' /><!--endemo--><br /><br />I notice in talk on forums devoted to the asus mobo that different versions of the asus BIOS had different version numbers for the nvidia generated memory access code revisions associated with them (presumably as the asus engineers fiddle about trying to find the most stable solution for them), and this latest version of the bios for the asus s2e seems to have fixed my issues at least.<br /><br />I am even now overclocking slightly atm - only about 130MHz, nothing crazy,  but just so I am running the fsb and memory in sync at 1605MHz and it&#39;s still all stable.  <br /><br />Your issues might be driver related true, but since the 790i boards are very newly released, then no matter which motherboard manufacturer your board is from there will still be teething issues.  Especially if it is code from nvidia that is actually causing intermittent memory stability issues.  Not blaming nvidia at all as I am definitely not 100% sure where my issues came from, but definitely keep an eye on bios updates for your board.<br /><br />I get the feeling that in general the 790i chipset is a little flakey... and to think I waited until it came out for it&#39;s lower heat output only to have it flake out when not even stressed <!--emo&:/--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/blarg.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='blarg.gif' /><!--endemo-->  <br /><br />good luck&#33;&#33;<br /><br />oh another quick thing (I know - post is getting long <!--emo&:P--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/tongue.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='tongue.gif' /><!--endemo-->) at least with the striker 2 extreme there is evidence of what ppl are calling fsb &quot;holes&quot; eg - running fsb or memory at a particular stock frequency causes the machine to freeze and break at random intervals, whereas pumping the mhz up a tiny bit makes everything magically work.  I am using 1605Mhz as the freq of my fsb and ram as when it was at 1600 this is when I got the hdd corruption.  Other asus users are reporting that there machines will freeze and reboot when using 1600MHz stock frequencies, but when overclocking they can reach even 1800MHz and higher and be stable...<br /><br />bumping mine up to 1605 with a quad pumped bus means that the &quot;real&quot; clock speed moves up from 400MHz to 401MHz... so perhaps while waiting for a magical bios revision silver bullet just play around with:<br /><br />- backing down memory timings to something less demanding like 9-9-9-24 to start with (without knowing what your RAM is rated for)<br />- setting your fsb/ram frequencies to odd numbers in case you are getting this weird freq hole<br />- bumping your RAM voltage up/down a tiny bit in case it is under/overvolted by default - but please check with your RAM manufacturer&#39;s data sheet before going nuts... in my case corsair states that it is rated for 1.9V so I set it to around that - not sure what your board would supply by default...<br /><br />I have found that in my experience, if hardware is the cause of your issues and not software, then:<br /><br />CPU issues cause reboots or freezes<br />memory issues cause freezes or blue screens<br /><br />among lots of other issues of course... but I strongly suspect that my issues were memory related... but yeah I am rambling now... hope it works out for you&#33; <!--emo&:D--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/biggrin.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='biggrin.gif' /><!--endemo--><br /><br />*salute*

  I have 100% identical problem to original poster.<br /><br />Which is not all too suprising since we have the same memory, video card, motherboard.<br /><br />I also was running Crysis at 40-50FPS in very high, and I put on 4x or 8x AA and it immediately started stuttering and crashed.<br /><br />It happens in Age of Conan as well. <br /><br />I&#39;m worried the problems are related to the OCZ Ram. I might try RMA&#39;ing it and getting different RAM.<br /><br />I have tried increasing the fan speed in RIVA Tuner to see if it was a heat problem. I can convincingly rule that out. The fans at 100% keep the cards well below 55C at full video specs in AOC.<br /><br />I have tried adjusting RAM voltages. From 1.5 to 1.9, 1.7 seems to run the most stable.<br /><br />I tried removing one 2GB stick of ram, still crashing.<br /><br />I have flashed the bios to the latest version.<br /><br /><br />The only thing that seems to reduce the crashing is lowering the graphic quality down to &quot;medium&quot; settings. Which kind of defeats the purpose of my 9800GTX&#39;s <!--emo&:(--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/sad.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='sad.gif' /><!--endemo-->

  I have had freezing randomly in Cod 4, GTA San Andreas, TF2. I&#39;ve sent back my motherboard now (MSI P7N Diamond 780i SLI) both because of this isssue in games and the well known video freeze issue. My xfx 9800GX2 sat right in top of <a href='http://img.hexus.net/v2/news/msi/DiamondB.JPG' target='_blank'>the brown square</a> you can see in the middle. I guess its the NB or SB and got too hot ?<br /><br />I have tried all sorts of WHQL and beta drivers and even without any drivers installed at all. Get random freeze with one and both RAM slots filled.<br /><br />I just have a hard time to believe its something wrong with the Graphics card because the freezing is random. It&#39;s temperatures are about 60C idle and 70+C load. CPU temp is stable. Tried different voltagesettings for RAM aswell.<br /><br />Guess I&#39;ll be choosing another type of motherboard, X38 or X48. Suggestions?

  Hiya...<br /><br />Im having the same problems with a very similar system. Ive got the 790i and 2 SLId 9800GTXs, 4gb (2 2gb sticks) DDR3 1333mhz. It freezes just like yours, not just in WoW though.<br /><br />The more I read about this online, the more I start to think its a trash chipset rushed out the door before support. Strangely though, there are a lot of people who its working fine for which makes me think that one batch came out fine and ours belong in the trash can...<br /><br />Im looking into an intel chipset that can handle my processor + ram + cards, this nvidia stuff is... unbelievably bad <!--emo&:(--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/sad.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='sad.gif' /><!--endemo-->

  <b>NVidia Driver problems - Multi-Test-Environment - Results</b><br /><br />Updated post - Bios Update (in my case 0704 ASUS) does not help<br /><br />Hi all,<br /><br />many of nVidia Users seem to face the same problem since estimated <br />March/April 2008 with pc freezes when playing 3D games, me too.<br />I tested some possibilities on two different PCs - because I bought a <br />new one (2.800 Euros) due to freezes on the old one and <br />- bad surprise - more often freezes.<br />The results of the tests may be interesting in order to solve the problem,<br />if anybody is interested to take care on this issue. <br />Feed Back is welcome. <br /><br /><b>Test environment:</b><br />PC1 (the old one) freezes since (estimated) March/April 2008, after <br />years gaming without problems:<br />MSI 7204 Ver 1.A Intel Express Chipsatz (&#33; no nvidia)<br />MDT 2* 1GB DDR2 667 CL4<br />XFX 7880 GS Extreme 256MB DVI<br />and also tested<br />Club 3D 8800 GT 512MB<br />Windows XP Professional 32 bit SP2<br />Newest nVidia Geforce driver (international version)<br /><br />PC2 (the new one)  freezes when delivered last week:<br />Asus, Striker II Extreme Bios Rev. 0704 (the newest, May 29th)<br />OZC 4*1GB Platinum 3P13332GK (7,7,7,20, 1.8V)<br />Leadtex GF9800GX2 R 1 GB DDR3<br />Windows XP Professional 32 bit SP3<br />Newest nVidia nforce and Geforce driver (international version)<br /><br /><b>Problem:</b><br />All three configurations (3 different graphics cards) freeze, when <br />playing WoW, Neverwinternight 2 and some other 3D-games.<br />They even freeze (rare), when surfing Internet in many windows<br />and loading graphical content. <br /><br />Original Graphics drivers coming from Leadtek, XFX or Club 3 D <br />do not help. The uninstall routines from nVidias older drivers in my<br />opinion do not remove properly the new versions (registry&#33;) and<br />the uninstall from Windows &gt;&gt; Software is incomplete as well. <br />Result: dead end - and possibly more problems if trying to <br />downgrade drivers.<br /><br /><b>Differences in freezing:</b><br />Old PC: freezes in WoW when moving character after estimated <br />30 to 120 minutes (with 8800 GT earlier, with 7880 GS later).<br />New PC: freezes in WoW when moving character after 5 to 20 <br />minutes latest.<br />Neverwinter Night 2 as well when moving character, but not as fast,<br />normally after 20 to 40 minutes.<br /><br /><b>What is the conclusion?</b><br /><br />The make of the graphic cards is not the point (Leadtek, Club 3D, XFX<br />are all hit in my tests).<br />The motherboard manufacturer and the motherboard chipset are not<br />the point (Asus-nVidia, MSI-IBM).<br />The nVidia graphic card components may be the point - if there are<br />same components used in all three cards, but then it must be a design<br />problem because the lots of these components (production quality<br />differences) can not be not the point, it is just too much time between<br />the production dates of the graphics cards components tested.<br />But this is a guess is not having a good chance because of the stability <br />of the graphics cards failed beginning March/April maybe beginning <br />May 2008 (I do not remember surely when it starts with freezes).<br /><br /><b>What is open then?</b><br /><br />The only remaining possibilities for the problems now in my point<br />of view are <br />==&gt; a bugged nVidia graphics driver <br />&gt; responsibility nVidia or<br />==&gt; an incompatibility with Windows XP-updates around this time<br />&gt; responsibility nVidia and Microsoft.<br /><br /><b>Fazit:</b><br />A better graphics driver is higly appreciated. Even if its beta. @nVidia<br /><br />Regards from a very disappointed customer. <br /><br />Sorry for typing and wording mistakes - English in not my native <br />language.<br /><br />Remark: Copy of Post has been sent to nVidia customer support, <br />if they give feed back I will post it here.

  Check your CMOS settings to make sure that the CPU is not being undervolted. That is the problem I have been having and a bunch of other people. Check your booklets for acceptable voltages.

  I submitted my problem a few posts back, and have now swapped the motherboard with a Gigabyte GA-X48-DQ6 and still have the same symptoms in Cod 4. I&#39;m trying to adjust voltage and ram settings without overclocking just to see what happens.

  i have exactly the same problem.everything are ok on desktop (internet, music players,videos,movies etc.). but if i play a game randomly it freezes (just freezes not odd graphics-just freezes) and the only that i can do is reboot (reset).the freezing happens randomly (between 20 minutes and an hour).this happens with two games that i play: titan immortal throne and two worlds (i have 10 days my pc and i haven&#39;t installed other,but i think that the same will happen in any game). my questions are: 1) is there anyone that has 9800gx2 and games don&#39;t freeze?or is just me that have it? 2) i almost convinced (tested almost 4 hours without a problem) that this happens when i use multi-gpu graphics rendering and not in multi-display. even though the games are almost equal with multi-gpu and multi-display,i am very frustrated because i payed 500 euros for this card. the difference in 3dmark06 is 14450 with multi-gpu and 12320 with multi-display.a big difference. i have done anything.i have used cleanerpro and tried all the nvidia drivers from 160.00 to 175.16 and it has no effect, the problem remains.i installed programs like rivatuner to increase graphic card fans,but the same.i installed programs like speedfan and all are perfect about the temperature of the card. i installed humanhead of nvidia and let it work for over 6 hours and it doesn&#39;t freeze (i hoped that it would freeze and iwould rma back to buy a new one,but nothing).i checked the voltage of my ram,everything ok.and even though it was auto i changed it to 2,00 v. (manufacturer say 1.7-2.00) and yet nothing.<br />the thing that worries me the most is that the card has no problem and the solution of rma is useless because nothing will change.i feel helpless.<br />please....someone that uses the same card contact me and tell me if has a solution or has no freezing, in order to risk it (risk, because i almost confident that the card has no problem)and rma. the only thing that i haven&#39;t done is to upadate bios,because i read that many have done this and nothing changed.<br />ps. i have asus striker 2 790ultra chipset (i start to believe that the freezing problem has to do with the m/b).if someone has asus striker 2 790 and the same gpu please send me and tell me if has the same problem. if someone doesn&#39;t have freezing please contact me, i want to be sure if everyone that has this parts have the same problem.<br />PS. I ALSO CHECKED HARD DRIVE (AND NO PROBLEM)<br /><br />my system isn&#39;t overclocked:<br />PC POWER &amp; COOLING Silencer 750 Quad<br />CASE COOLER MASTER RC-690 -KKN1-GP BLACK (3X120 &amp; 1X80 COOLERS)<br />E8400@3.00GHZ<br />CPU COOLER SCYTHE NINJA PLUS REV.B<br />ASUS STRIKER 2 790 ULTRA<br />ALBATRON 9800GX2<br />2GB (2X1) CellShock DDR3 Micron D9JN PC3-15000 (8-8-8-16)<br />HDD SATA2 500GB SEAGATE 32MB BUFFER -7200 RPM<br /><br />O/S WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION SP3<br /><br /><br />ps2. unfortunately, the problem is not solve with multi-display.the games with multi-gpu crash randomly between 20-50 minutes and with multi-display after 1.30-2.00 hours (i hoped that multi-gpu had the problem...crap). <br />

  I think NVidia is taking the piss. I wish they would actively participate in this thread and add some comments on what they are up to. I bought 2 9800 GTX&#39;s, because I thought it would make a killer combo. So far, nothing but regrets.<br /><br />So, mods, if you are reading this, tell the driver-programming team what they need from us to make it happen... I&#39;ll be happy to test any new (beta)drivers to get my system running in a way it should be.<br />

Gamed for about 5 hours earlier this morning and 3 or 4 last night (after thinking loosening my memory even more, 2 full timing #s higher and 6 in tRAS than it&#39;s rated for fixed the problem on this driver...<br /><br />Research tells me that many people have experienced many more problems, including more freezing with this driver version than 175.16 hence the reason Nvidia pulled it, but maybe it&#39;s made to address 9800g__ problems and in the process created problems with other cards.<br /><br />I do not believe I had crashing in 174.xx but I would have to constantly alt tab out of games for a minute or two because the auto fan speed runs at 39% MAX speed and usually as low as 4% and after a while my GPUs will be at 90 degrees celsius which causes crashing.<br /><br />Regardless, most people say anything later than 169.* causes crashing and I believe they are correct.<br /><br />I have asked eVga if i could RMA my 9800gtx&#39;s for 8800gtx 512s just so I can use 169.21 and not get crashes.  There&#39;s no reason why I should have to wait untiil 2010 for Nvidia&#39;s next driver update which will probably not even fix this.<br /><br />I do know this.  Next system will have nothing Nvidia.  And probably nothing Intel even though their crap works just because they are in bed with Nvidia, so just for moral reasons.<br /><br />The ATI 4850 roughly equal to an insanely overclocked GTX 280 and faster in games that need it, like Crysis.  The 4870 is faster than that, and maybe a third the cost.<br /><br />The way I see it, Nvidia owes me a full refind, tax and shipping costs included on my 790i and 9800gtx.  It is unacceptable to release a product with so many bugs and then not fix them months later.<br /><br />I am certain that in order to fix even half of the issues with the 790i that a full recall would have to be done as the hardware is just not designed properly and a firmware update will just not fix.  But of course Nvidia will not do that because they are too busy being cheapskates, swimming in their money bin of all the money that they stole from the consumers who they bent over and screwed real good.<br /><br />EDIT: Since Nvidia wont even recognise half of their problems, I am going to suggest that we start a class action lawsuit against them.  Maybe that will get their attention, and get them to start addressing these issues, right here, right now and in this very thread.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is, I do not see one of the following statements on the box of any of their products, meaning it is a FALSE advertisement.<br /><br /><br />-This product does not work as advertised all of the time.<br /><br />-You may Experience Random Freezing and Crashing With This Product. Good luck&#33;<br /><br />-You may experience instability with this product until it is fixed with a newer driver which only introduces more problems.   By 2012, when this product is long obsolete and no longer supported, we might have a working driver.<br /><br />-There is a hardware flaw with this product preventing it from ever working right.  However, we would lose too many products to design a whole new product that does work right meeting these specs and offering a recall, so we&#39;re just going to have to call it the 800i and charge you for it.<br />

  A point of interest which may help,<br /> Crysis ran beautifully for me up until I returned from holiday &amp; ran it again &amp; it kept  crashing to desktop, I fiddled with everything I could think inc  installing different drivers etc  to no avail until I suddenly remembered I had altered something in the bios prior to my going away, I had altered the memory setting from auto &amp; selected one of the higher settings manually, I set it back to auto &amp; all is well.<br /><br />set your bios to defaults &amp; test a game &amp; then put back your original settings one by one. Memory is a prime suspect

With some other progams you may have to set the fan speed to 99% and back to 100% to get it to hold, but with evga precision tool I just put it in startup and it solves that issue.<br /><br />If you are running your RAM at more than the 790i will handle, then you will get a lot of crashes.  But if you adjusted your timings accordingly, then the problem is not OCZ - people have the same problems with Corsair and Crucial models made for this board.<br /><br />Here is my memory guide to the 790i.<br /><br />The board appears to have issues when handling large amounts of RAM - not picked up by memtest or stress tests.<br /><br />Set cmmand rate to 2T.  Board just will not handle 1T.<br /><br />Add 1/1/1/3 to your memory timings so if you have ram that is 9-9-9-27, you should be running it at least at 10-10-10-30 (2T).<br /><br />Lower your memory timings no lower than 7-7-7-21-2T at up to 1333mhz and 8-8-8-24 from the 1600 to 1800 mhz range.  Use stock voltage.<br /><br />If you have RAM rated at 7-7-7-21 or lower latencies try these timings, which are good for up to 1600mhz.<br /><br />8-8-8-24-2T<br /><br />tRRD – 1 (always)<br /><br />tRC – 38 (Auto sets this too low.  The general rule is to use whatever you use for tRP and tRAS, add them  together and 2 as the lowest safest setting, but I&#39;m not sure that rule holds true with DDR3.  Some people will say to use 50+ here, if you really want to be safe.  This is the most important timing with nvidia chipsets, but also has a fairly large impact on stability.).<br /><br />tWR – 12<br /><br />tWTR – 19 <br /><br />tFAW – 40 (try setting this to your tRC value + 2 with 2gb ram.  try tRC + 12  with more than 2gb, so 50.  Auto is usually really low).<br /><br />tREF – 7.8uS - set this manually rather than using auto, auto uses 7.7 and people report that that alone causes them problems. <br /><br />

  Hi again,       (** updating multi-test environment thread **)<br /><br />changing RAM settings and using 175.19 did not resolve my freezes.<br />But - totally nerved I cut of all drives and USB cabling to the motherboard (except hard disks and mouse/keyboard) and surprise - no more crash (configuration see above, please).<br /><br />Then adding step by step the blue-ray, and 3.5&quot; and card reader and ... oops last crashed. Ok it was the card reader. Connected: Freezes - Not connected mo more freezes.<br /><br />And surprise all my testing computers had card readers...<br /><br />Now it was to check why the freeze came after different time<br />&gt; with 3D games fast <br />&gt; with internet surfing very rare and<br />&lt; only with windows and office never<br /><br />What could be the difference? 3D is only in games - and partially in internet-pages to handle for the driver. Conclusion: non-3D-windows+office-functions are from now on out of interest.<br /><br />Ok but what was the reason for different time frames in games until the freeze comes...<br /><br />This was depended on how long it took until the card reader was activated (e. g. indexing or virus scan) by a process starting while 3D active.<br /><br />This addressing conflict is NOT shown in windows resources as a conflict.<br />I. m. h. o. it must be a misuse from the graphics driver of resources already used/assigned by the card reader. This would explain as well the different behavior of the very old driver versions (96.*)... in most cases only freezing the 3D-application - not the computer.<br /><br /><b>With deactivated card-reader (cable disconnected) no more crashes - no more trouble. </b> I do not really need the card reader, but please nVidia check your driver...<br /><br />I cannot say that this will be the solution for others - but good luck. I think it is worth a try.<br /><br />Best regards

  Well I crashed again... been playing a lot of older games and not too much over that time period but it crashes near instantly in newer games World in Conflict or Call of Duty 4.

My computer would lock up watching 2 mins of video sometimes and it definately wasn&#39;t a cooling issue because i&#39;ve got a water cooling setup.<br />Ok get rid of the ASUS drivers and the &quot;recommended&quot; drivers off the EVGA site.<br />Goto the Nvidia website and latest graphics drivers (177.79 at present, like one of the previous posters said - preferable for an Sli setup for NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX/9800 GTX (x2)) and the proper nvidia chipset drivers (9.64, I&#39;m using 6.02 at the moment actually with no probs but might update soon). If you really want to be certain you could select Option 2 in Download drivers section: &quot;Automatically find drivers for my NVIDIA products&quot; for both &quot;Graphics Drivers&quot; and &quot;Motherboard Drivers&quot;, which will install some active-x crap but at least you can be certain that you are installing the right drivers. Also I removed AVG8 but that&#39;s my personally preference and may not relate to the crashes. Anyway have fun&#33;  <!--emo&:))--><img src='http://forums.nvidia.com/style_emoticons/NVIDIA/smile2.gif' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle' alt='smile2.gif' /><!--endemo--> <br />

  I had the exact same problem as everyone here.  I just got a brand new laptop with an nvidia 9800M and every 3d game I played would freeze within about five minutes.  Usually the screen would lock up, occasionally with a sound loop and always required a hard reset.  This went on for two weeks, much to my frustration with my new top of the line laptop.<br /><br />However, I saw someone mention in this post about removing their mouse, and disabling the memory card reader.  So when I got home today I did three things for the first time:<br /><br />1.  Reinstalled the nvidia driver using registry cleaner.net (I had previously reinstalled the driver a few times, but this was the first I used registry cleaner in safe mode).<br />2.  I uninstalled the card reader in my laptop (from the control panel&#39;s &quot;uninstall programs&quot;)<br />3.  I unplugged my mouse.<br /><br />Now I have run a few games, including Crysis, several times from a fresh restart.  So far it has never crashed, and this is the first time i&#39;ve been able to use the laptop to game.  However, when I start the game with my usb mouse plugged in, the games freeze EVERY TIME THE SAME WAY, within the first five minutes of the game.  <br /><br />I am inclined to believe it is my mouse that&#39;s causing the issue.  I guess I&#39;ll have to go shopping for a new one (I&#39;m using an old basic logitech optical mouse I bought about five years ago).  Here are my specs, FYI:<br /><br />    * Intel Core 2 Duo Processor P8400 (2.26GHz, 1066MHz FSB, 3MB L2 cache)<br />    * NVIDIA GeForce 9800M GTS with 512MB of GDDR3 discrete video memory<br />    * Windows Vista Home Premium (64-bit) SP1<br />    * 4GB (4096MB) DDR3 800MHz Dual Channel Memory (2 x 2048MB modules)<br />    * 200GB 7200rpm Serial ATA hard drive w/ 16MB Cache<br />    * 9-cell 11.1v 7800mAh battery, 120w power supply

  holy crap i thought i was alone, as soon as i added the 2nd evga 9800GTX for SLI im getting all sorts of freezes and nvidia display driver has stopped responding bull crap, has nvidia or someone found a fix for this yet besides having graphics on meduim or running lower res&#39;s?<br /><br />I have latest bios, drivers , etc...
