		1. Introduction
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>The graphics card market can easily be described as a vast place, consisting of numerous brands and manufacturers, a fact that is sure to confuse the potential buyer. Which card should they buy? Which type suits their needs, be it &quot;office use&quot; or for extreme gaming experience (chillin' 3D or heavy 3D environment respectively). How much VGA memory is really required by the latest games without it affecting performance? Which card supports which features and last but not least, which is the most affordable solution?</p>
<p>Throughout these pages, we will try to give a more comprehensive view of some of the latest PCI-E graphic cards out there by comparing their performance with the aid of some of the well known benchmarks available. </p>
<p>The cards we selected to present in this review are based on the following chipsets:</p>
<table width="150" border="0" class="small" align="center">
  <tr align="center">
    <td><strong>ATI</strong></td>
    <td><strong>NVidia</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td>X300<br>
X600<br>
X800<br>
X850</td>
    <td>6200<br>
6600<br>
6800 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Before proceeding with any of the tests, we should mention that there is more than one version of each card, with differences in performance. For example, there is the X800, X800XL and X800XT or the 6800GT and 6800Ultra. In our case, we selected only one from each chipset instead of all of the versions, since we only want to point out some major differences between each card and help a potential buyer  make up their mind. </p>
<p><strong>-A brief &quot;3D&quot; History </strong></p>

  <p align="left">Over the last few years, the need for better and better graphics cards has risen and as expected, has eventually led to a battle between the manufacturers with a single aim:  market dominance. It all started with the release of the Voodoo series from the now defunct 3dfx, which featured the first consumer-level 3D hardware, adding 3D graphics to the 2D rendering cards using a pass through cable offered with the 3D accelerator Voodoo cards. Later on, Voodoo 4 came out in either a single PCI or AGP interface card, which led  more or less to the now familiar scene  we have in the graphics card market.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>&quot;A <B>graphics card, video card</B>, <B>video board</B>, <B>video display board</B>, <B>display adapter</B>, <B>video adapter</B>, or <B>graphics adapter</B> is a component of a computer which is designed to convert a logical representation of an image stored in memory to a signal that can be used as input for a display medium, most often a monitor utilising a variety of display standards. Typically, it also provides functionality to manipulate the logical image in memory.&quot; </em></p>

  <p align="left"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/4review/hro_directx_left.jpg" width="98" height="130" align="left">Several major changes have taken place since then in  graphic cards technology such as the AGP X bus speeds and of course the integration of Vertex/Pixel shaders as well as Direct X support (originally known as the &quot;Game SDK&quot;) and the latest, PCI-E interface. All these contribute to the performance of the graphics cards and their ability to &quot;render&quot; the latest 3D applications, which in the main involves games. </p>

		2. 3DMark05
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	
  <p align="left"> <img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/3dmark/3dmark05_logo.png" width="226" height="41" align="left">With 3DMark05, Futuremark continues the tradition in its benchmarking software by providing a state-of-the-art Microsoft &reg; DirectX &reg; 9 3D performance benchmark. <br>
    3DMark05 is an all new 3DMark version making the most of Microsoft's DirectX 
    9. The previous version 3DMark03, did a nice introduction into this level 
    of technology. However 
    3DMark03 used DirectX 9 specific features in a limited manner, because fully 
    supporting hardware was rare at the time of its launch. In contrast, 3DMark05 
    requires DirectX 9 hardware with full support for at least Shader Model 2, 
    and takes shader usage to never before seen levels. <br>
    Just like its predecessors, 3DMark05's point system is set so that at the 
    moment of release, the high-end VGA cards available in stores can only score 
    around 5000 3DMarks, whereas the worst card that meets the programs requirements 
    yields a score of 1000. <strong><br>
  </strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><em>Game Test 1 - Return to Proxycon </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><em> <img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/3dmark/gt1_thumb.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="200" height="147" border="1" align="left">Being the sequel to the &quot;Battle of Proxycon&quot; 
    from 3DMark03, in &quot;Return to Proxycon&quot; we're once again set in space 
    and the battle continues as space pirates invade a cargo ship in order to 
    take control of its valuable cargo.</em><em> </em></p>
  <p align="left"><em> This test, tries to simulate a future first-person shooter game with all the high details that entails. The dynamic shadows, high-detailed environment and advanced lighting techniques ensure that under normal circumstances, no recent card can run it with decent frame rates.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><em>Game Test 2 - Firefly Forest </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><em> <strong><em><a href="/Sections/Articles/Sources/Connect3D_X800/Images/3dmark/gt2_huge.jpg"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/3dmark/gt2_thumb.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="200" height="170" border="1" align="left"></a></em></strong>A forest gets filled with magic fireflies in the night. The moon is nearly full, illuminating the forest with a bluish faint light. The magic fireflies have flickering bright green lights that playfully move around the forest. </em></p>
  <p align="left"><em> This scene is a nice example of a smaller scale outdoor scene with rich vegetation. Immediate visibility is not so far, and there is a skybox surrounding the whole scene. </em></p>
  <p align="left"><em> A large number of trees with their branches swinging separately, and dense vegetation being dynamically distributed according to the camera movements, make this test the most demanding of the three. </em></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><em>Game Test 3 - Canyon Flight </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><em> <img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/3dmark/gt3_thumb.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="200" height="145" border="1" align="left">A Jules Verne type airship flies through a canyon guarded 
    by a dangerous sea monster. The airmen defend their ship using heavy cannons, 
    but these seem to have no effect on the huge sea monster. Finally the crew 
    manages a narrow escape using the &quot;last resort&quot; afterburners of 
    the airship.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><em> This scene is fairly complex with large areas of water 
    reflecting the high canyon walls. The water actually is one of the key points 
    of interest in this scene. The water not only does realistic looking reflections 
    and refractions, it has a depth fog, making the sea monster swimming under 
    the airship actually look deep down in the water. The air in this scene also 
    uses a volumetric fog, making distant cliffs of the canyon really look far 
    away.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><em>Final Score </em></strong></p>
  <p align="left">In the final scores for the  3D marks benchmark,  we can see that the X850XT series graphics card registered the highest score, followed by the 6800GT series and X800. All cards scored at least a thousand marks, meeting the benchmark's requirements.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>- Game Test 4 - Mother Nature (DX9)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/3dmark/GT4.gif" width="200" height="150"></p>

  <p align="left"><em>Activision made it's miracle again with Doom 3 which is said to be the best-looking game ever, thanks to the brand-new OpenGL graphics engine used to generate its convincingly lifelike, densely atmospheric, and surprisingly expansive environments. If you are a fan of the previous Doom games then you will get many flashbacks with this revision, since you will find reimagined versions of almost every monster from both Doom and Doom II. </em></p>

  of Deus Ex from now on we'll be testing our cards using Thief 3. It's based 
  on the same engine but it's much less GPU intensive and playable by more VGA 
  cards than <img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/thief/garrett.jpg" width="170" height="236" align="right">Deus. </em></p>
<p><em> The game makes severe use of Pixel Shader 1.1 instructions, the bloom effect and stencil shadows to achieve a wonderful result in your screen. </em></p>
<p><em> In the game you play the part of Master Thief Garrett who is back to rule out any evil forces using his unique stealth abilities. Deadly Shadows shows what stealth gameplay is all about. This game really gives you the feel of sneaking around and holding your breath when stuck in a sticky situation. </em></p>
<p><em>Since there is no official benchmark for the game, we'll do our tests using 
  a GPU intensive scene from the tutorial-level which we believe that represents 
  the average fps you'll get when playing the game.</em></p>
<p align="left">Thief 3 is a torture test  for any graphics card. Even at low resolutions and with no multisampling enabled, the results are far from great, when in other latest games we have figures of 100+ FPS.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/graphs/ThiefNoAA.png" width="502" height="575"></p>
<p align="left">The X850XT delivers the best framerate especially as the resolution rises, but even without any of the advanced game features enabled, we can see that at higher resolutions, the framerate drops considerably. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/7GCards_RoundUp/Images/graphs/ThiefAA.png" width="501" height="574"></p>
<p align="left">Only the two high end graphics cards can offer a satisfactory playing environment with AA and AF enabled. All other card owners are advised not to enable any of the advanced features to avoid a jerky game. </p>

		11. Conclusion
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p>It's obvious from the previous pages,  which of the tested cards are  Heavy 3D environment capable cards and which of them are Chillin' 3D environment cards. We can separate  the list into three basic categories. The first is  Chillin' 3D, for office use as many label graphics cards that are meant  for simple operating system use (much like the onboard graphics cards). The second category would be the average performance graphics cards, or the cheaper versions of the Heavy 3D, which are meant for gaming at an affordable price. The last category and the best is Heavy Duty. These are the expensive cards, which are meant  strictly for gaming purposes and are  purchased primarily by hardcore gamers.</p>

<p>Price is a major factor and  will affect the buyers choice. Often, the buyer  will compare the performance of a specific card that suits his needs against its price and bundled software (a compilation of software, utilities and most usually full pressed games that come with the retail box) to arrive at a suitable trade-off. </p>
<p> Manufacturers, in an effort to make their products more appealing,  also offer a wide range of features with their cards such as integrated TV tuners and such. This is another issue that the potential buyer will  contemplate  before buying any specific game card. Which one  offers the most features.</p>
<p>Overclocking  is a different issue altogether, which  we will not discuss here, as we have concentrated on the shipped versions of the graphics cards and not their overclocked versions, even though sometimes, a lower performance overclocked version will outperform the high end cards. </p>
<p>Summarising, we have: performance, features, bundle (retail box) and of course most importantly, price. Below we have posted a table with some of the graphics cards used in this comparison along with their respective price range. The wide variance in price per card is due to the fact that each card is available in editions, ranging from basic models up to extreme. For example, in the case of the 6800, we have the GT  and  Ultra editions, with prices of US$500 and US$700 respectively. The same  applies to ATI chipset based cards.</p>

<p>Throughout these pages, we have attempted to provide a comprehensive coverage of the capabilities of some of the latest PCI-E interface graphics cards. Another major factor is the the overall PC system which can make a marked difference,  so users should take this into account (CPU, system clock frequency, memory type and size, etc).</p>
<p>We hope this comparison has helped you choose from the wide variety of the graphics cards available on the market.</p>
