                        ABOUT THE CONFERENCE<br>
 <br>
SIGIR'95 is an international research conference on information retrieval<br>
theory, systems, and applications.  The ACM SIGIR conference occurs<br>
annually, alternating between locations in North America and elsewhere<br>
(e.g., Europe).  This conference will interest a broad spectrum of<br>
professionals including theoreticians, developers, publishers,<br>
researchers, educators, and designers of systems, interfaces, information<br>
bases, and related applications.<br>
 <br>
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the First Society in<br>
Computing, is a major force in advancing the skills and knowledge of IT<br>
professionals and students throughout the world.  ACM serves as an<br>
umbrella organization offering its 90,000 members a variety of forums in<br>
order to fulfill its members' needs -- the delivery of cutting-edge<br>
technical information, the transfer of ideas from theory to practice, and<br>
opportunities for information exchange.  Providing high quality products<br>
and services -- world-class journals and magazines; dynamic special<br>
interest groups; numerous "main event" conferences;  tutorials; workshops;<br>
local special interest groups and chapters; and electronic forums -- ACM<br>
is the resource for life-long learning in the rapidly changing IT field.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                TOPICS<br>

                                PAPERS<br>
 <br>
SIGIR'95 seeks papers about significant contributions to the broad field of<br>
information storage and retrieval, which covers: handling of all types of<br>
information; its applications; information systems; and underlying theories,<br>
models, and implementations.<br>
 <br>
We encourage discussions of experimental studies, tests of usability,<br>
explorations of information-retrieval behavior, reports on large scale<br>
system performance, and demonstrations of advanced approaches.  We prefer:<br>
that contributions that discuss theory have sufficient motivation and<br>
proof of utility; that designs have been proven by a prototype; that<br>
reports on small-scale experiments include convincing arguments or<br>
simulations to show their likelihood to generalize; and that writing is<br>
carefully copy edited and well organized.<br>
 <br>
All papers shall provide a concise message to the audience about how the<br>
work relates to previous research or experience, what aspects of the work<br>
are new, and the "lessons learned."  Papers will be evaluated on the basis<br>
of originality, significance of the contribution to the field, quality of<br>
research, and quality of writing.<br>
 <br>
Papers shall be submitted in English to the relevant Program Co-chair.<br>
Specific submission requirements:<br>
 <br>
(a) Papers shall be submitted in four copies.<br>
 <br>
(b) Papers must include an abstract of not more than 100 words.<br>
 <br>
(c) Papers must be 20 pages or less (double spaced), including abstract,<br>
        figures, and references.  Final versions of accepted papers may<br>
        require further trimming to meet publication standards.<br>
 <br>
(d) Authors shall provide a separate cover page (not included in the length<br>
        limitations) with the title, the author name(s), and the author<br>
        affiliation(s), plus complete contact information (mailing address,<br>
        telephone, FAX, and e-mail) for the author to whom correspondence<br>
        should be send.<br>
 <br>
(e) Show the word count for the paper on the cover page.<br>
 <br>
(f) Indicate if the paper is to be considered for the Best Student Paper<br>
        Award. This Award requires that the first and primary author be a<br>
        full-time student at time of submission.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                TUTORIALS<br>
 <br>
SIGIR'95 will begin with a full day of tutorials, each of which is<br>
intended to cover a single topic in detail.  Proposals are solicited from<br>
people willing to give tutorials. Tutorials may be either a half day (4<br>
hours) or full day in length and can cover topics at an introductory or<br>
advanced level. Submissions shall be made to the Tutorials and Panels<br>
Chair and shall consist of:<br>
 <br>
  (a) An extended abstract outlining the exact content of the tutorial.<br>
        This should be approximately 3 to 5 pages in length. Sample slides<br>
        would also be helpful.<br>
 <br>
  (b) Tutorial Length: half-day or full day.<br>
 <br>
  (c) A description of the intended audience outlining what attendees are<br>
        expected to know,  the technical level of the tutorial and the<br>
        objectives of the tutorial.<br>
 <br>
  (d) A CV for each presenter detailing relevant qualifications and<br>
        experience. Some biographical details may also be helpful.<br>
 <br>
  (e) A complete description of A/V and computer equipment required for the<br>
        tutorial.<br>
 <br>
  (f) Complete address for the presenter(s), including phone, FAX and e-mail<br>
        addresses.<br>
 <br>
E-mail submissions shall be in plain ASCII text.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                   PANELS<br>
 <br>
SIGIR'95 will include a small number of panel sessions. These are intended<br>
to examine issues of interest to the research and development community<br>
and stimulate lively debate between panelists and audience members.<br>
Presentations by panel members should lay the groundwork and open the<br>
debate. Ideally the panel shall consist of 4 members, with very divergent<br>
views on the topic. The moderator shall referee the debate, ensuring a<br>
good balance in the discussion without presenting a position.  Proposals<br>
are solicited from moderators and/or panelists.  Submissions shall be made<br>
to the Tutorials and Panels Chair and shall consist of:<br>
 <br>
(a) An extended abstract outlining the proposed topic, including the questions<br>
        likely to arise.<br>
 <br>
(b) A list of panel members and the name of a moderator.<br>
 <br>
(c) A CV for each panelist and the moderator, detailing relevant<br>
        qualifications and experience.  Some biographical details may also be<br>
        helpful.<br>
 <br>
(e) Complete addresses for the moderator and panelists, including phone, FAX<br>
        and e-mail addresses.<br>
 <br>
E-mail submissions shall be in plain ASCII text.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                            DEMONSTRATIONS<br>
 <br>
Demonstrations provide an opportunity for first-hand, interactive<br>
experience with information retrieval systems.  Researchers and developers<br>
have the opportunity to present their new systems, and conference<br>
participants have the opportunity to interact directly with creators of<br>
the systems demonstrated.<br>
 <br>
We invite proposals for demonstrations of information retrieval systems<br>
and applications.  Demonstrations should focus on aspects of the system<br>
that are novel and important. Demonstrations are not limited to<br>
experimental systems only. IR researchers participating in the NIST/ARPA<br>
sponsored TREC, MUC, TIPSTER projects and the European Community research<br>
initiatives are encouraged to participate.<br>
 <br>
Presenters of the systems must be individuals who have been directly<br>
involved with the development of the system, and who are aware of the<br>
differentiating and interesting ideas embodied in their system.  All<br>
presenters are expected to register for the conference.<br>
 <br>
Presenters shall submit a proposal of at most three pages, describing the<br>
planned demonstration, to the Demonstration Chair.  The proposal shall<br>
include:<br>
 <br>
(a) A description of noteworthy and distinguishing ideas or approaches the<br>
        demonstration will illustrate.<br>
 <br>
(b) An explanation of how the demonstration will illustrate these ideas or<br>
        approaches.<br>
 <br>
(c) Complete contact information (mailing address, telephone, FAX, and<br>
        e-mail) and affiliation of the person(s) who will present the<br>
        demonstration, including their relationship to the project (e.g.,<br>
        principal investigator, developer, project manager, architect).<br>
 <br>
(d) A 100-word summary for inclusion in the conference's preliminary program.<br>
 <br>
(e) A description of the technical specifications of the system.  The selected<br>
        presenters shall provide a description that is modeled after the TREC<br>
        technical specification descriptions.  An electronic form will be<br>
        available via e-mail.<br>
 <br>
(f) A bibliography of published and unpublished materials that relate to the<br>
        system, its algorithms and underlying theories as well as any<br>
        evaluations that have been undertaken.<br>
 <br>
(g) The hardware, software, and network requirements for the demonstration,<br>
        including the electrical requirements of the equipment.<br>
 <br>
No FAX submissions; e-mail submissions preferred.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                POSTERS<br>
 <br>
SIGIR '95 will include poster presentations to enable researchers an<br>
opportunity to present late-breaking results, significant work in<br>
progress, or research that is best communicated in conversational mode.<br>
Poster presenters will have the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one<br>
with attendees and to discuss their work in detail with those most deeply<br>
interested in the same topic.<br>
 <br>
Posters will be reviewed by appropriate subject specialists as well as the<br>
Program Committee, and will be selected on the basis of their contribution<br>
to research-focused discussion. Posters will be accepted a full month<br>
later than papers in order to provide an opportunity for submitting very<br>
current work that need not be written up in a full paper.<br>
 <br>
Abstracts of posters will appear in the conference proceedings.  There<br>
will be a specific time during the conference when authors will be<br>
expected to be present at their posters to describe their work and answer<br>
questions, but posters will also be accessible for informal viewing<br>
throughout the day.<br>
 <br>
Doctoral students are encouraged to consider poster submission as a viable<br>
means for discussing ongoing dissertation research.<br>
 <br>
Submissions shall be made to the Posters Chair and shall consist of:<br>
 <br>
(a) Abstract, submitted in three copies.<br>
 <br>
(b) An extended abstract of approximately three to four pages.<br>
 <br>
(c) Abstract shall emphasize the research problem, the approach or methodology<br>
        being used, and why the work is important.<br>
 <br>
(d) A separate cover page with the title of the poster, the name and<br>
        affiliation of the author(s)/presenter(s), as well as complete contact<br>
        information to include postal address, email address, phone number<br>
        and FAX number of the author(s).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                WORKSHOPS<br>
 <br>
Proposals are being solicited from both individuals and groups for one-day<br>
workshops to be held on July 13.  Workshops bring together researchers to<br>
share information and discuss a topic that relates to their expertise.<br>
Submissions shall be made to the Workshops Chair and shall be limited to 3<br>
pages.  They shall contain:<br>
 <br>
(a) The theme and goal of the workshop.<br>
 <br>
(b) The planned activities.<br>
 <br>
(c) A CV for each organizer detailing relevant qualifications and<br>
        experience (not included in the length limitations).  Some<br>
        biographical details may also be helpful.<br>
 <br>
(d)  Maximum number of participants.<br>
 <br>
(e)  Process for selecting participants.<br>
 <br>
(f)  List of potential participants.<br>
 <br>
After the workshop, organizers will provide an article summarizing the<br>
workshop for SIGIR Forum.<br>
 <br>
No FAX submissions.<br>
