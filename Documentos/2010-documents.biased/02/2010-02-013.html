								<div class='snap_preview'><p>I am home!  And it is snowing outside.  It&#8217;s beautiful.  Welcome to the Christmas season!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty overwhelmed right now, as I try to get back into life here.  I visited St. Olaf on Sunday night and nearly drowned in the amount of information I had to process immediately.  I was fully aware that time passes at home while you&#8217;re gone and I thought I was prepared, but I guess you can&#8217;t prepare for it.  So now I&#8217;m sitting here playing and replaying all the details in my head, trying to get a grip on how my home reality has changed without me since July so I can move on and become a part of it once again.  Truth is, I just want it to be January so I can get back to school and start my social clean-up.  Ha.</p>
<p>But I am also, as usual, very excited for Christmas.  It was hard to believe that winter and December were happening while I was in Tanzania.  The occasional Christmas carol would float out of a storefront, but most of Tanzanian life went on as usual without the huge consumerist, snow-obsessed buzz that the United States is used to.  Even though I don&#8217;t personally like to spend oodles of money on Christmas gifts, I enjoy the cheer and traditions that come with the season and really missed walking through decked out malls and hearing Christmas music 24/7 on the radio.  So I&#8217;m glad to be home.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.jacobs-well.net" target="_blank">jacob&#8217;s well</a> on Sunday, though, they played this video before the service and I quite liked it so I&#8217;m linking to it.  There&#8217;s more discussion of it on <a href="http://precariouspastor.net/2008/12/15/advent-conspiracy/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> if you&#8217;re interested but here&#8217;s the video.  The video&#8217;s home site is <a href="http://www.adventconspiracy.org/" target="_blank">www.adventconspiracy.org</a>.  Enjoy!</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>Well it turns out Mwanza is not my favorite place in Tanzania.  The city is big and dirty and not used to <em>Wazungu</em>, so just chilling for a week is not as easy as it is in Arusha.  Zoe and I walked around for two days, each thinking the other was doing what she wanted to do and so not voicing the fact that we hated what we were doing.  Ha.  We&#8217;re still such Americans.  Anyway, over a delicious lunch of sweet and sour chicken at a distant, deserted, touristy Chinese restaurant that offered a great view of the lake and some much-needed silence after crazy downtown, we called the number of a hostel on Ukerewe Island so see if we could spend a night.  We ended up spending two.  Pretty much, we got there and it was so much more chill than Mwanza and so so beautiful that we simultaneously decided we didn&#8217;t want to go back to Mwanza until we had to (I&#8217;m back here now because we have tickets to fly out in about six hours).</p>
<p>The hostel we called ended up being the cell phone number of a darling woman named Mama Ferista, who does technically run a hostel called Gallu Beach Hotel, but which is &#8220;closed for renovations&#8221; right now so we stayed in Ujamii Hostel, aka her house.  It was absolutely wonderful.  There was no running water or electricity, of course, and the mosquitoes were something to be reckoned with, but she has a whole slew of grandchildren around the house and she gave us cooking lessons (she is quite possibly the best cook I&#8217;ve met in Tanzania).  Once the kids figured out we knew Swahili and wanted to play with them, they were all over us.  They begged to take pictures and play with our headlamps, they fought over who got to sit in our laps.  They took us by the hand and dragged us to where music was playing so we could all dance together, and they fell asleep in our arms after dinner.  It was so nice to play with kids again!</p>
<p>We also went on a bike tour of the eastern side of the island with a less-than-enjoyable tour guide, Mr. Tumaini.  Not to be negative, but when I say less-than-enjoyable, I really mean I couldn&#8217;t stand him and he was openly deceitful and is the epitome of what I hate in Tanzanian men.  The bikes, too, left something to be desired.  Mine was too small, had no brakes, and the seat fell off every other time I tried to get on it.  Zoe&#8217;s got a flat tire in the first half hour and had no breaks either.  Oh well.  ha ha ha  The bike RIDE was beautiful, and I enjoyed myself despite the difficulties.  If someone were to come to Mwanza, I&#8217;d tell them in a heartbeat to go straight to Ukerewe &#8211; just bypass Tumaini Tours.</p>
<p>Time&#8217;s up again.  Sorry.  This may be my last entry from Tanzania, as I leave the day after tomorrow and plan to spend all day tomorrow on the beach of Mbudya Island.  Can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>peace</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>Well Zoe and I finally made it to Mwanza and what a trip it was!</p>
<p>We stayed at my favorite hostel in Arusha, Ujamaa Hostel, for the night and watched a good amount of Friends episodes with the other hostel guests. I swear, I will never get sick of that show. The great thing about Ujamaa is that it&#8217;s set up like a house so that all the guests at the hostel interact like a family. We sleep on bunkbeds in one of the two rooms, we share a bathroom, we eat breakfast and dinner together around the dining room table each morning and evening, and we veg on the couch like one big, happy, Western-sitcoms-missing family. Ujamaa even has three dogs that we can play with in the yard (Jamie, they&#8217;re big now!). Love it.</p>
<p>Anyway, as much as we love Ujamaa, Zoe and I said our goodbyes on Wednesday and hopped an Akamba bus to Nairobi. We managed to cross the border quite easily, only being jipped by the ridiculous exchange rate when paying for our transit visas. FYI, at NO point in my time here in Africa has 20 USD been equivalent to 33,000 Tsh. No way. Oh well.</p>
<p>Nairobi brought our first taste of how much reverse culture shock we&#8217;ll have to deal with when we go home. It was full of multi-level buildings, flashing lights, and billboards in English! We waited for our connection bus in a waiting room that was playing competing English TV channels across the room and occasionally announcing bus departure times in a mix of English and strange-sounding Swahili. Out on the street, lights flashed and good hip-hop music rang out from pimped out daladalas and second-story nightclubs. The hecklers approached us as usual, but would ACTUALLY LEAVE US ALONE when we said a simple &#8220;No thanks.&#8221; WHAT?!?! I could hardly deal with it all.</p>
<p>Then, we got on our bus and drove through the night back Southwest to the Kenya-Tanzania border. We stopped at gas stations where we could pay for a toilet (at least these were still not westernized) and where we could get frisked by a policeman or woman before getting back onto the bus (A wakeup call to Kenya&#8217;s security issues, I guess).</p>
<p>We had no trouble at all when crossing back into Tanzania. Our residence permits let us in for free (insert a sigh of relief here, since the fee for re-entering Tanzania with out that would have been 100 USD). The drive through Tanzania (it&#8217;s daytime now) was hot as anything and quite long, but we finally made it to Mwanza. Except here&#8217;s where our trouble started. We got dropped off NOT where we thought and proceeded to get lost for about an hour with all our stuff on our backs&#8230; but then we made it and now we&#8217;re staying at the Christmas Tree Hotel and exploring the city.</p>
<p>My time is about out, so I have to go now.  More updates later.  I&#8217;ll be home in a week!  How crazy is that?</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>Well we made it!  Mt. Kilimanjaro (5,985-ish meters), the Roof of Africa, was conquered by myself and three good girlfriends at 6am local time on November 28th, 2008.  aka: during Thanksgiving  dinner for all those in the United States.</p>
<p>We hiked for a total of 5 days through about 5 different ecological zones, all beautiful and all still pretty pristine.  We met people from all over the world and found ourselves worrying about how these perfect strangers were doing as they climbed.  We shared blister band-aids.  We  climbed endlessly and then descended in a rush.  The stars were beautiful, the view was breathtaking, the glaciers are still there &#8211; somewhat &#8211; and the adrenaline was phenomenal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently sitting in an internet cafe in Arusha, Tz, killing a day before my friend Zoe and I head to Tanzania&#8217;s second largest city, Mwanza.  Mwanza is in Northwestern Tanzania, on Lake Victoria.  It is famous for its fishing industry and &#8211; I&#8217;m told &#8211; holds a lot of economic power because the region is also good for mining and coffee.  It&#8217;s supposed to be a beautiful city on the lake, surrounded by hills studded with huge boulders.  There are a number of islands near Mwanza that offer great &#8220;getaways&#8221; as well.  Zoe and I have no plans as of yet, so we&#8217;ll see what we end up doing.  Personally, at this point it&#8217;s fun just to hang out in these cities.</p>

							<h2><a href="http://photographsandticketstubs.net/2008/11/28/uhuru/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Uhuru">Uhuru</a></h2>
							
							<div class="entry">
								<div class='snap_preview'><p style="text-align:left;">I have no pictures of the hike to the summit because it was way too cold to stop and take my camera out but that hike was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced. I hiked with my headlamp off, trusting the guide and the light from others&#8217; lamps. The hike to Gilman&#8217;s was spooky. Every so often we came upon Tanzanian men whose job it was to assist along the trail. They lay along the side of the path, half frozen, looming out of the darkness like fallen soldiers. I managed to breathe a greeting to a few but only one ever responded. It was too cold and there was no air. We passed climbers on the side of the trail, out of breath or on their hands and knees, vomiting. Young, fit climbers were being carried to the peak; their eyes blank, a dead weight on the shoulders of the men who carried them. Things got emotionally and psychologically difficult but there&#8217;s not enough air up there to take that initial gasp you need to cry so I looked at the stars and followed Orion to the peak; one foot in front of the other, deliberately climbing over and around boulders, ignoring the precipitous drop into the darkness of the crater to my right. From our height I could see glimmering cities on the Kenyan and Tanzanian feet of the mountain. Looking back the way we came, tiny bobbing lights snaked down at an impossible angle &#8211; many people were attempting to peak that clear night and we were in front. We kept going, listening to our guide, Josef, softly chanting tunes to pass the time and lift the spirits. As we circled the crater, reaching peak after peak that wasn&#8217;t Uhuru, dawn came and Orion set behind the elusive Uhuru ahead. Behind me the world was soaked in the widest sunrise I have ever seen. 270 degrees of light silhouetting Mawenzi and drenching the glaciers in pink and orange. It got colder and steps got harder. Time stretched to eternity but it was beautiful. The glowing ice was magical and the moment was mine. No cameras could have captured it and no words described. There was no air or energy to exclaim so I rejoiced in silence. I&#8217;ll remember that dawn forever.<br />
The peak finally did arrive and I was so befuddled by cold that I didn&#8217;t do it justice despite the huge effort it took to bring my camera that far. I guess some experiences live best in memory.<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-291" title="Uhuru Sunrise" src="http://photographsandticketstubs.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/img_69291.jpg?w=458&#038;h=306" alt="Uhuru Sunrise" width="458" height="306" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing from the Marangu Hotel in Moshi, Tanzania.  We have been briefed and are now &#8220;prepared&#8221; to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro tomorrow.  We will do a five day climb via the Marangu Route and will reach Uhuru peak about the time all you USAers are eating Thanksgiving dinner &#8211; if all goes well, of course.  So, wish me luck and Happy Thanksgiving!  I&#8217;ll be sure to let you all know how it goes when I get back down.</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>Hello all!</p>
<p>Just a quick note:  I will be leaving Dar at the end of this week and won&#8217;t be back until I come back to leave the country on December 11th.  Because snail mail takes a few weeks, I can&#8217;t promise I&#8217;ll get any mail that isn&#8217;t sent today or tomorrow.  My suggestion would be to simply email me if you have something to say or send letters to my school or home address.  Thanks to everyone who DID send me mail!  It always brightened my week.</p>
<p>Love!</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>I have just finished catching up on Chelsea’s India adventures and I’ve got to say, I’ve been shamed.  Somehow, from the middle of nowhere India, she has managed to keep you all updated about the wonderful things she has done these past few months – and in glowing detail nonetheless!  Her stories of the people she has met and the lessons she has learned make me jealous even as I am here having my own adventures in Africa.  Oh if only I could be in two places at once!  I’d be there with her in India in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, that will have to wait.  Perhaps she’d be willing to take me back there.  What do ya say, Chels?  I’ll trade you a tour of Tanzania for a tour of India. <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>There has been a student strike going on here at the University of Dar es Salaam for the last few days.  Parades of students on walkout marched past our house the last two days and my host dad came home last night to say that branches were thrown on his car as he was driving to work.  Apparently strikes like this happen every year.  This one is due to the government’s failure to distribute the loans it promised to much of the student body.  The University has demanded payment for the semester and without their loans to help them pay, many students are being sent home.  Now they’re striking to try to get the money they need.  There’s an extra twist in the story involving embezzlement of millions of shillings by some higher-ups in the Tanzanian government, but sadly my Swahili wasn’t quite good enough to decipher exactly what all that was about.  I’d guess that the money that was supposed to go to the students actually went into government pockets.  Anyway, the strike has been a tiny bit terrifying because students are being pulled off buses on their way to school and – as I mentioned – people in cars on the University grounds (where we live) are being called “thief” as branches are thrown on their hoods.  Every time I go out, people ask if I’m a student at the University and why I’m striking and now today a notice was circulated that the University has been closed and all its students suspended until further notice.  We’re not sure when classes will resume.  We’ve heard two weeks from now, but we’ve also heard February – aka next semester.  All students (with the exception of foreign students who would have nowhere to go) were required to move out of the dorms immediately and police and soldiers began to roam the campus to “keep the peace.”  Let me tell you, I was pretty nervous to go out on the streets today.  Oddly, though, this whole thing seems routine.  The notice was published and then everyone just packed up and left!  There was a short rally and the police had fun with their megaphones, but I don’t think any trouble really commenced.  By mid-afternoon, the campus was completely deserted.  It was even quieter than I remember it being in the weeks before classes started and we left for the field!  I can’t decide if this silence is eerie or refreshing after the last few days of demonstration.  It certainly will be strange not to hear the usual morning racket of discordant music blasting from the windows of overcrowded dorms nor see entire hillsides covered in drying laundry.  And it will be strange to have the run of the campus again.  Suddenly there are places to sit and study and the possibility of functioning internet and power and water!  I don’t know what I will do with this sudden influx of resources!  Maybe I’ll actually get my work done.</p>
<p>I am currently sitting on my bed in my host parent’s house, procrastinating on my mountain of homework (this will be posted tomorrow morning when I [hopefully] find internet somewhere up at the main campus).  I had a delicious dinner of chapati, njegere, maharage, na mboga (or beans, greens – spinach-like but more ground up, and peas – always slightly undercooked by American standards, eaten with a chapatti).  For dessert, I had ndizi na embe ndogo (fried sweet plantains &#8211; my absolute favorite thing to eat here &#8211; and a small mango).  Did you know that there are two types of mango?  There are big ones and small ones and they grow on different types of trees!  I prefer the big ones because you can get a lot more meat from them, but the mini mangoes were not bad at all.  Just pretty fibrous.  I was happy I had floss when I was done with mine.</p>
<p>Last night my housemate, Mackenzie, our host parents (hereafter called Mama and Baba), and I went to Mlimani City to see the new James Bond movie, <em>Quantum of Solace</em>.  (Mlimani City is a very Western mall on the way into town from the University.  It’s handy to have nearby for chocolate emergencies.)  I’m sure most of you have already seen Bond, since everyone in the world is a James Bond fan (I know this because it is the only movie I’ve seen come out in Tanzania at the same time as in the States.  A worldwide opening!  Congratulations, Bond).  Mama hadn’t been to the movies since <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> – which came out before Mlimani was even built – and she was a riot, always squealing at the fight scenes.  Baba was quieter during the movie but professed his love for it afterward.  Apparently he’s a big fan of the old Bond movies and was impressed by how Daniel Craig measured up to Sean Connery.  I personally thought the movie was good but not as good as <em>Casino Royale</em>. – Mostly, I was surprised to notice how shocked I was by all the violence.  I guess I am no longer desensitized to American violence after three and a half months away from our mass media.  What a revelation!  American movies are violent beyond belief!  Geeze!</p>
<p>Mama and Baba are good sports when it comes to hanging out with Mackenzie and me.  On November 5th (Guy Faux Day), we invited them to watch <em>V for Vendetta</em> with us and, to our surprise, they were completely game!  To clarify, both Mama and Baba are fluent in English and actually speak it more often than they do Swahili.  Baba is originally from Mbeya, in Southern Tanzania, and Mama is from Cameroon (so her first language isn’t Swahili anyway).  They both went to college in London, which is where they met and why they knew about Guy Faux Day in the first place.  They moved to Dar es Salaam after living in England for eight years.  They watch a silly South African soap opera – which is mostly in English – every evening during dinner and correct us when we don’t use the British English for things like “I’m full” <em>you should say “I am finished”</em> or “papaya” <em>which they swear isn’t an English word.  The correct word is “pawpaw.” </em>They are absolute dears and Mackenzie and I are really enjoying being little kids again (cause that’s what it feels like).  They even bought us popcorn at the movie! <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>A side note about the movie theater:  I have been to the movies twice now since I’ve been here.  My first time was when I went to see <em>The Dark Knight</em> during my first few weeks in the country.  Both times, I’ve been fascinated by the pre-feature advertisements which are clearly directed at the wealthy, movie-going crowd.  There are ads for fitness clubs and health spas even though I don’t know many Tanzanians who would use such facilities.  There are hotels and restaurants and conference rooms for rent and a new high-rise in downtown Dar that boasts fourteen condos and three four-bedroom, three-floor suites complete with their own swimming pools – all on the top thirteen floors!  Dar is one of the most expensive world cities to live in.  I can’t imagine anyone who could afford such a thing here let alone HOW they managed to construct such a tower and how they think they’re going to support it when the power and water regularly go out all over town!  &#8211; And I can’t help thinking of the beggars that no doubt sit on the tower steps just as they do all over downtown Dar, hoping for a few hundred shillings donation from passersby.  Sometimes the disparity between rich and poor is so obvious it hurts.  Actually, always.  But why do places like this tower even exist?!  There are much better things people could be doing with that money.  Here’s an idea: give it to those students who were denied their loans so they can finish their education and make a life for themselves.  Spend it on developing a waste management plan for the city so that the “rivers” we cross don’t stink to high heaven because they’ve become landfills and so we don’t have to walk through clouds of smoke from burning garbage in 100 degree humidity everyday.  Use it to build more secondary schools so that there’s enough space to teach this country’s next generation.  There are a million things you could do with money like that, each one better than the last. But for God’s sake, spending it on private swimming pools twenty stories up is not a responsible option.  That’s ridiculous.  And yet, it has been built.  This tower and many others like it exist all over the globe.  Sometimes this world disgusts me.</p>
<p>Well it’s getting late and I have a whole new day of work ahead of me tomorrow as I am trying to study for two final exams – each of which constitutes 60% of my grade in their respective classes, write two final papers for those same classes, write up my research paper, and create a bilingual poster summarizing my findings.  I have two more days of work time and then it all hits the fan on Saturday.  I’m pretty sure I’ll fail both my finals but not for lack of studying or learning or anything.  I’ll explain later.  For now, wish me luck and as I wrap up here, I’d like to point you in the direction of Chelsea’s blog once again.  She has eloquently painted a picture of her time in India and it truly is a joy to read.  If I had done half as good of a job keeping you all updated on my adventures as she has done, you’d see the many parallels between her experiences and my own (not that we’ve had the same experience at all, I’m just over here learning many of the same life lessons she is).  Anyway, I promise I’m working on filling in the blank that is the field and the most phenomenal part of my trip so far.  I have decided to back-post those stories so people can keep straight what happened when.  I imagine it would get pretty confusing if one post says I’m stuck here writing papers and the next says I’ve been off gallivanting across the savannah riding sidesaddle on the back of a bicycle.  So check October for field stories.  Love you all!</p>

								<div class='snap_preview'><p>Yep.  sorry I didn&#8217;t give a recap on my month-long excursion in that last post.  American politics took precedence. <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   I&#8217;ve got to say, though, it was really fun to post that from the US Embassy in Tanzania.   What a great election story.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much time left on my computer in this internet cafe, so I won&#8217;t be able to give you much of an update on the field now either.  sorry.  Things get difficult when there&#8217;s no power on campus.  I&#8217;ll keep working on a more complete post.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for you now:</p>
<p>The field was great.  It was hot, though.  Hot beyond imagination.  Tarangire National Park &#8211; where I stayed &#8211; got up to 111 degrees Fahrenheit in the sun and 96 in the shade.  You couldn&#8217;t go in your tent after 8 in the morning because it was a minimum of 102 degrees in there.  crazy.  It was beautiful, though.  TNP is a gorgeous park with tons of animals and some great landforms ranging from swamps to grasslands.  I got to visit a bunch of Maasai bomas and made friends with some of the women.  They have phones, so there&#8217;s even a possibility of staying in touch!</p>
<p>&#8230;that&#8217;s all I have time for now, but stay tuned.  I hope everyone is doing well.</p>

							<div class="entry">
								<div class='snap_preview'><p>WELL!  That was exciting!  I&#8217;ve got to say, the excitement and anticipation that no doubt ran rampant in the US in the last 24 hours definitely permeated my corner of Africa.  Was Obama talking to me and my five friends as we sat huddled over a hand radio in a taxi on the way to the US Embassy when he said &#8220;&#8230;to all the people huddled over a radio in the forgotten corners of the world&#8230;&#8221;  It sure seemed so.  Wow.  Good job, America.  That felt like a revolution.</p>
<p>My story:<br />
We got back from the field at dinner time on Monday.  (I managed to get my absentee ballot in, in case you were wondering.)  Yesterday (election day cause it&#8217;s 11 am on November 5th here) was hot and muggy as can be and I spent the day readjusting to being in a city and trying to stay calm as I waited for the United States to wake up and start voting.  Luckily, my host family has satellite TV and my host parents were just as interested in the election.  We watched CNN election coverage through dinner and then late late into the night with three other friends.  We witnessed record voter turnout and early calls for Obama.  At about midnight (4pm on the East Coast), we couldn&#8217;t stay awake any longer and took a 4 hour nap.  At 4am (8pm on the East Coast), we were up again, watching Al-Jazeera and BBC coverage as a huge rainy-season storm buffetted the house and leaked through the ceiling.  The electricity flickered several times and finally went off just before 7am (11pm on the East Coast) but &#8211; thank the Lord &#8211; came back on so we could see them announce Obama as the projected winner as soon as the last poll closed in California.  We took pictures by the TV. <img src='http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   The electricity stuck around long enough for us to see part of McCain&#8217;s concession speech (which was quite good, I thought) but then died for good.  Hence, the radio and the taxi.  We got to hear Obama&#8217;s speech live on the radio, but had no visual.  When we got to the Embassy, they had several TVs and computers set up as well as a big screen playing NBC coverage.  After a few hours they replayed the speeches and I finally got to see Obama accept.  Like McCain, he was gracious and poised.  Both speeches were inspiring but truly, the most inspiring thing I saw last night was how many people are out in the streets over there in the US.  The celebrations happening at home seem bigger than New Years and the 4th of July combined.  The projected voter turnout is staggering and the projected margin of victory hopeful.  Americans really do care.  I&#8217;m so happy I can tell this story and that I&#8217;m finally proud to be an American.</p>
