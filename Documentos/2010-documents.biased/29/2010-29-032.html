		 <span style='font-size:11px;'>08/09/2004 05:56 AM</span><br/>According to <a href='http://www.slashdot.org'
target='_blank'>Slashdot</a> and <a href='http://www.security.org'
target='_blank'>Security.org</a>, Kensington Locks are extremely
vulnerable to very simple attack. With the most basic of tools costing
less than $1, it's possible to unlock the device that offers
'security' to many thousands, if not millions, of laptop users
worldwide.<br />
<br />
Security.org report that using a bic pen and a pair of scissors, the
protection from theft can be over come within 30 seconds. More
worryingly, the procedure does not leave any damage to the cable /
lock. As such, you would not be able to claim the $1500 that
Kensington offer if a product is stolen whilst protected with one of
its locks, due to the specifics of the guarantee. <br />
<br />
So far, Kensington have not commented on the issue. One would suggest
that you keep, as ever, a rather good eye on your laptop and any other
products protected by their kit.<br />

<strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>:
The OpenTheGovernment.org report on US government secrecy has just
been published, and boy are its conclusions harsh: the US government
is $6.5 billion/year keeping stuff secret (not counting the CIA
budget, which is another secret), 90% of those documents don't contain
anything particularily secret, and the result is that government
agenciies and the public have their effective operations hamstrung
because critical parts of the information needed to get by have been
classified.

<blockquote>
Compounding the problems is the fact that the government can't seem to
let go of secrets that just aren't valuable any more. It took the CIA
20 years to declassify the fact that Augusto Pinochet, Chile's
dictator, had a taste for distilled wine. Overall CIA budgets from
decades back are still kept under wraps. And the pace of
declassification has slowed since 9/11: 43 million pages in fiscal
year 2003, as opposed to 100 million in 2001, according to the ISOO.
Not surprisingly, the amount of money spent on releasing information
has also slipped, from $231 million in 2001 to $54 million last year.
<p>
At the same time, the public thirst for government information seems
to have risen. More than 3.2 million requests for federal documents
were made under the Freedom of Information Act last year. That's about
1 million more than in 2001.
<p>
The cost of keeping secrets, according to OpenTheGovernment
coordinator Rick Blum, comes largely from maintaining the patchwork of
databases and networks that hold the government's sensitive
information. Physical security of classified information has also been
a major cost -- and a major concern. The repeated misplacement of
secret disks at Los Alamos National Laboratory has shut down the
nuclear weapons center for the last six weeks. That means a big chunk
of the lab's annual budget of $2.2 billion has been devoted to the
security lapses, so far. Those figures weren't included in the
OpenTheGovernment report card.

		 <span style='font-size:11px;'>12/26/2004 11:03 PM</span><br/><p><a href="http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/article/1765/">DRM
at Its Worst? Here's a Prime Example</a><br />
<blockquote>"DRM is actually a part of Microsoft’s Windows XP
operating system and has been for a while, but it wasn’t until I
picked up a DVD recently that I witnessed the ugly and very user
unfriendly side of DRM in person. The DVD in question, T2: Extreme
DVD, produced by Artisan Home Entertainment Inc., is a two-dvd disk
set, which holds a digitally optimized version of the T2 movie on one
disk, and a high definition version of the same movie on the second
disk, encoded in WMV9 format....</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after trying to play the DVD back with Windows Media
Player 9, I couldn’t get it to work. For some reason I needed to
install a 3rd party application, InterActual Player, that was required
to play back the content. I was a bit surprised as to why I needed to
install InterActual Player as it clearly says Windows Media Player 9
on the cover. Why can’t I simply play the content back without
having to install yet another application? But then it became quickly
apparent that I did not only have to install and download an update
for the InterActual Player over the internet in order to facilitate
playback, but would also need to acquire a license. So obviously the
WMV9 content on the DVD was protected by DRM and could only be
unlocked after connecting to the license server to obtain a license,
which it failed to do. I was surprised to find that it failed to give
me a license as it had determined that my physical location was not in
the US or Canada. Apparently the content was only to be played back in
either one of these countries and nowhere else. After routing my IP
address through an anonymous proxy server in the US I however managed
to unlock the content just as well and was presented with a license
agreement I had to agree to prior to being able to play the content
back.</p>

<p>That agreement, amongst other things, stated that I could only play
back the content for a period of five days, on the computer I
installed the InterActual Player application onto, after which I had
to re-acquire a license. To be honest that really pissed me off, I
spent about an hour trying to play back a disc I legitimately bought
and went as far as installing and updating a 3rd party application to
my system that would allow me to do so, and now I’m only being given
a temporary license, where’s my rights as a consumer?... Shame on
you Artisan Home Entertainment Inc. and may this serve as a prime
example of DRM at its worst." [<a

to watch a movie? I sure wouldn't.</p>

<p>Whatever did happen to fair use and the right of first sale in the
digital world? I miss them.</p><br/><h2>IBM locks in VMware through 2007</h2>

Monday, and say they hope to have it fixed by midday Friday.
Meanwhile, unable to view their budgets or pay their bills, many
affected users are livid.<br />
