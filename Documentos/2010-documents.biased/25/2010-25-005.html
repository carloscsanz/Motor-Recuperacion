OCZ has some platinum's with cas7 but they've been OOS @ the egg for almost 3 months. I talked to tony and he said he'd let me know when they egg is gonna have them again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its 140 for three 2 gb sticks.  Buy two kits, use the four 2 gb sticks, pay 280, sell a member here the remaining two 2 gb sticks for 100, viola!<br />
<br />
If you want it, I am thinking of buying two of these kits, I can sell you two sticks for 100.  They retail for about 100 USD when they are in every 31 lunar cycles on jupiter.</div></div><hr />

As u may know amd prefers tight timings to speed in mhz...so am right now running this at 6-6-5-18 1T at 1.65V. My IMC is too weak to run 1600, and anyway this seems to give better results with a higher clocked NB.</div></div><hr />

Max stable was 1411mhz 6-6-6-18-24-1T at 1.8v for me but with some voltage mine easily does 1500mhz+ 6-6-6-18-24-1T stable and was great fun benching with, with appropriate voltage... They should run 1600mhz CL7 without a issue in this world</div></div><hr />

I agree on that.<br />

I have Micron D9GTR chips (Team Xtreem D3-1866C8 2Gb kit) which working great on Intel systems (2000mhz 7-7-7-21 2T on X38 and X48 mobo), but fail to boot to windows @1600mhz 9-9-9-24 2T on my PII 550 even @2.0v<br />
<br />
but maybe my PII 550 having a bad IMC :shrug:<br />

first thing you have to do if you looking for a good RAM is to check out if your cpu have a good IMC ;)</div></div><hr />

Wait, these (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227381) are the same exact specs.  What do you mean I have to go to 1800 for the same specs.<br />
<br />
The AMD plat edition are 7 7 7 24 1.65v, the triple channel are 7 7 7 24 1.65v, the amd is 2x2 gb, the other is 3x2 gb.<br />
<br />
What does the 1800 kit have to do with it?</div></div><hr />

I have the OCZ Gold (AMD edition) Cas8 and they've been great. I'm running 8Gb at 1600 Cl8 1.72v.<br />
The 8Gb really taxes the imc but 4Gb will do 1600 Cl7 easily.<br />
I originally had them in a GBT 790FXT-UD5P and had dramas because of bios issues but once I changed to the MSI GD-70 they have been rock solid.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />

Being the impatient sort I checked MicroCenter and they have 1 kit of what I beleive to be these sticks (except 2x2 4Gb)...<br />

Same specs as the ones you listed 1333 CL9 @ 1.5v... <br />
Anyone else second this kit? The price is certainly right. :)<br />

These sticks continue to give me great performance so I keep them and don't replace to get down to the 8's, 7's or lower. Mine are on a 790FX-GD70 with a 720BE running 203/3.552. Running sticks at 1353 (Because 1600 is no real gain) 1.65v and are rated up to 1.8v. 16462 Futuremark06 score. Not shabby for 9.9.9.24 2T. (They run at 1T but their fine 2T)<br />

They don't have heatspreaders so I didn't want to put the Vdimm too high but they ran a 1/2 hour prime blend @ 7-7-7-24-29 1500Mhz with only 1.65v.<br />

Daveburt, i have 2x1GB Crucial Value 1333 cas 9 stuff here with D9JNM chips on them, they can 1600 6-6-6 but subtimings suck.<br />
<br />
Always slower than my OCZ platinum low voltage stuff, i think i need to spend some quality time tweaking this ram.<br />
<br />
1600 6-6-6 requires 1.95V at least, a bit much for 24/7 usage i think.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info Zeus.  I'm not sure why (maybe 2x2Gb?), but my kit has the D9KPT's.  I haven't really pushed them yet but I don't think I'd be comfortable with 1.95v's... ;)<br />
<br />
It's a really nice kit for the price, but I can't help thinking I should have ordered the G.Skill RipJaws for $30 more (sigh).... :cool:<br />
I've had pretty good luck with G.Skill stuff! Hopefully someone will buy that kit and post some results....<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd definetly be interested in a chew* tested kit as soon as I sell my 9950 rig...<br />

Yeah, 2GB modules usually carry KPT chips, 1GB modules usually have JNM.<br />
<br />
Tbh, i'm not really impressed by the sticks, they need too much volts for my liking.<br />
<br />
I recently discovered my 2x2GB OCZ platinums can do 1600 6-6-6 too, unfortunately not at their rated 1.65V lol. They have got to be Micron equipped.<br />
<br />
Winning the 965BE was quite a surprise for me too, i can't wait to torture it. :)</div></div><hr />

Most users will be best off 1600 6-6-6 or 1333 5-5-5 and not bother with 1800.<br />
<br />
See what happens when I rip through a few sets. <br />
<br />
If they do pass my torture I will post indepth timings for the 3 major players etc tune a set to each board, MSI, giga and asus.</div></div><hr />

They don't have heatspreaders so I didn't want to put the Vdimm too high but they ran a 1/2 hour prime blend @ 7-7-7-24-29 1500Mhz with only 1.65v.<br />
Temp readings between the pair (hottest area) hit 53c toward the end of the prime run... I'm not too concerned about that. :p:<br />
<br />
Finally a decent 2x2 kit and I only had to spend $70... :D<br />
I prefer a naked RAM (no heatspreader). just put a fan blowing those RAMs and it gets a lot cooler than a RAMs with heatsreaders on it</div></div><hr />

No news is bad news....we ordered 4 sets of part number XX and we received 4 sets of part number YY......apparently the old stock they claimed to have was not old stock.....<br />
<br />
FYI if the actual part # was right it would have been Micron GTR based 2x2g..... for around $120. <br />
<br />
Looking into other options now. Might be another IC with potential just need to find it in the right bin.</div></div><hr />

I'm working on it........problem is I'm trying to keep the price range balanced for you guys to......elpida hypers are the best I used but I don't think you guys want to shell out $300 for ram.....<br />

Who here would spend $150 ish on a 2x2g kit if they did 6-6-6 1600+ without crazy volts? <br />
<br />
Just trying to get a ballpark of the avg guys budget, sadly I don't think any $100 kits are gonna do it and be good for 24/7 use.<br />

2x1gig http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227276 &lt;--- most likely GTR/GTS based on spec but no gurantees.<br />

Find something with micron GTR/GTS....most likely going to need 1.9v for 24/7 6-6-6 1600 which is why i don't reccomend them......I have a feeling if and when we get an exclusive ddr III IMC things are going to be &quot;different&quot;<br />

That was interesting..<br />

I want play with Gigabyte very soon thats why I cannot afford 2x2 at the moment. :D It will be interesting contest vs ddr2 brothers. <br />
<br />
I see you suggested Ocz Reaper. Heatsinks look cool. Too bad my Ninja 2 is very Fat compared with slim True :) So I go with Crucials. I suppose there is chance for GTR/GTS too?. Gigabyte would love it, right? :D<br />

<br />
Actually No.....however feel free to make AMD users spend ( actually waste ) money on ram that will not run Specs.........<br />
<br />
The problem You may fail to see is I have blasted through alot of kits.....testing.....I know what works, I know what doesn't.........alot of people see great results on intel and say hey those are good sticks.....they must kick ass on AMD  and then they reccomend them having used no such product.......<br />
<br />
I only reccomend what I have actually had in hand and used......But what do i know.....<br />
<br />
As far as what i said in the other thread......Me personally I would rather bask in my own sucess of stabilizing my own hardware my damn self than live in someone else's shadow.<br />

Put simply if people copy others they learn nothing......if they do it thereself they learn something.......am I guilty of trying to help people learn on there own? I guess so. Am I guilty of trying to save AMD users headache's, returns and money? I guess so.<br />
<br />
Really good info here........<br />

Not all mobo's are equal, not all ram is equal and not all cpu's are equal.......so having even the same model of everything and one batch # difference 2 people are going to arrive at diff settings for a stable clock.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I bought those hoping they would work well on both my i7-920 D0 and my Phenom IIs but Chew is right they just dont want to boot with the tight timings (up to 1.75V).  At least on my AMD 550be unlocked to quad.  I havent tried them on my i7 though.<br />

<br />
Well yes and no.....<br />
<br />
I ripped through 12 gigs on the BBSE elpida........<br />
<br />
None could pull C7 however just variations in the sticks made a diff in the overall clock acchieved.<br />
<br />
I binned them 2 sets 1 batch off one set was far from stellar other set was killer.<br />
<br />
Noted same thing with cpu's right next to each other in batch.......One had a killer NB the other was a dud. <br />
<br />
We are talking the diff between +.375 for 3000 NB and +.375 for 2400 NB......<br />
<br />
Same goes for boards.......<br />
<br />
Timings will vary but not CL. <br />
<br />
Overall speed is what will vary most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
110ns is slower and as you go up in TRFC you take even bigger hits.....If ram is capable I like to run it tighter.<br />

Usually I run into no issues at 90ns, with my gigabyte board if its not stable it will just reboot loop.</div></div><hr />

Sempron is going to have a weak IMC, I would avoid 1600 rated ram like the plague....shoot for stuff in the 1333 range. <br />

I've never tinkered with an AMD set up chew, but my friend has asked to build and overclock a Phenom II rig for him. I'm just deciding on the memory at the moment. You say to avoid 1600, would it be okay to get 1600mhz RAM and downclock (i'm not sure if you can downclock memory on amd systems :S) it to 1333? My reason is that because it is rated at 1600mhz it may be able to do 1333 with tighter timings? The numbers don't really matter, I just want to know if I have it right, ie. if I get ram that's rated at 2000mhz, will it be able to run at 1600 with tighter timings than memory that's been rated at 1600mhz</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only high bin stuff I have used is Elpida Hyper and BBSE and micron D9.<br />
<br />
Micron and hypers can be tightened however, your still at mercy of IMC....My 720 will not run 6-6-5 1600. I would be wary of most of the 1.65v rated c7 1600 stuff.....it could have anything under the hood like powerchips or BBSE. I have only seen one set of power chips pull spec 1600 7-7-7 and allow running tight 6-6-6 1333. <br />
<br />
Dragon wolf. <br />
<br />
Sometimes specced voltage alone is enough clue to get a basis on what IC's are used. Those mushkins are specced 1.7-1.8v. <br />
<br />
My guess is micron or samsung, leaning more towards micron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chew*</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here let me break this down for you guys a little to understand this better.<br />
<br />
Here we have a 720 BE.<br />
<br />
http://chew.ln2cooling.com/The_Laboratory/720BE.jpg<br />
<br />
965 BE<br />
<br />
http://chew.ln2cooling.com/965BE/IMG_1391.jpg<br />
<br />
What matters here is the first line of the stepping. Some of you will remember I posted a refresher thread of something s7 had done along time ago.<br />
<br />
So in the memory support/clocking/overclocking department theres is something key to look for in the stepping.<br />
<br />
First line 720 BE = CACZC<br />
<br />
First line 955/965 = CACYC<br />
<br />
This denotes an IMC revision......Those with the Y IMC revision have an improved IMC 1600+ is cake tight.<br />
<br />
Those with the Z revision are best suited for 1333 operation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out with choosing ram.<br />
<br />
I might note your just better off running 1333 tight no matter what as from what testing I have done at well above 1700+ 6-6-6 yields little fruit save for everest and PI 32m. <br />
<br />
Not only that but but interal timings and latencies of the processor are tighter when running 1333 divider.<br />
<br />
The clocks of 4 gig and up to 3000 NB are just to much of a bottneck for high ram clocks to be of any real use in real world apps.<br />
<br />
For cold benching....yes high ram clocks win....however tight + high still matters but only when cranking at 5gig +.</div></div><hr />

no it is joke, CACK = :banana::banana::banana::banana:, It comes from the Flemish kakken=to :banana::banana::banana::banana:<br />

NB ability has nothing to do with this batch #........It has to do with amd refining process and nothing more.<br />

Instead of anyone telling you which is freaking pointless.......since all chips are diff which I have said till i'm blue in the face..........<br />

Fry's has a sale on some value ram that uses those IC's, and after experiencing DDR3 on my main rig I'm very tempted to pick them up and throw them in my media center PC. It has an unlocked 720BE so I'd aiming for somewhere in the 1333-1500 cas 6 range as opposed to 1600+.</div></div><hr />

I'd bet money you have Micron D9's judging how well they scale with voltage. I'm running 4x2gb of them myself in my main rig and they do what i'm after with 1.7vdimm (1333 cas 6 with tight subtimings). At this point I'm probably just going to try to keep an eye out for another set of D9 based stuff as on intel those elpida non-hypers don't clock well at all with anything less than cas 9.:down:</div></div><hr />

They do everything you would expect and they are everything you would expect.  What I mean by that is they scale well with volts and the DDR1800 CAS 7 at 2.0v is the same kit as the DDR1600 CAS 7 at 1.8V.  You can run them both with very smiliar results.  ST has  been consistently better than GSkill and OCZ for me and has been in the same price range.  They run just as good on my AMDs as my Intel (Actually a little better on the AMD).  I've been using them for years.</div></div><hr />

I have tried with different settings and voltages, but it won't post with any setting below 7 (Ex. 7-7-6-20, 7-6-7-20, 6-7-7-20). I even tried T2, but no luck. Makes me wonder if maybe it's somehow hard-coded into the memory. :shrug:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing is written in stone, but this has always been a good starting point for me...  You can always tweak things from here. ;)<br />
<br />
If you have 7-7-7 clocks, add them together and set your tRAS to 21 (7+7+7) then add tRas (21 in this case) to the CL (latency (7)) and set Trc to 28... Tras + Latency.<br />
<br />
Another example would be, if your memory does 6-6-6.  Set Tras to 18 and TRC to 24 (18+6).... You get the idea... ;)<br />
<br />
I'm sure alot of the hard core folks already know this, but it's a nice rule of thumb for folks who may be confused about Ram timings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Don_Dan</div><div class="date">11-28-2009, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can add tRC x 2 = tRFC to that list! ;)<br />
<br />
It only works on Intel though, where you can set specific timings, not ns values.</div></div><hr />

Well, first of all, I expected much better packaging for 300 memory, it looks very cheap, so my first impression was disappointing, I love cool and great looking boxes and packaging... :)<br />
<br />
http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8672/dsc03145g.th.jpg (http://img69.imageshack.us/i/dsc03145g.jpg/) http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/3108/dsc03146j.th.jpg (http://img37.imageshack.us/i/dsc03146j.jpg/) http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/3220/dsc03147u.th.jpg (http://img163.imageshack.us/i/dsc03147u.jpg/)<br />
<br />
Then I took two modules and start to raising frequencies with default voltages and memory timings in bios while testing windows xp stable boot from bios to desktop... The end was running cpu frequency 4112MHz with 1.40V, nb frequency 2820MHz with 1.17V and memory 1880MHz 7-8-7-20 27 1T 1.65V<br />
<br />
http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6469/bootwb.th.jpg (http://img21.imageshack.us/i/bootwb.jpg/)<br />
<br />
This is just first run, probably not stress stable, only boot stable... I know there are plenty chew's screenshots all over the forum so I will study memory timings closely but after first bad visual impression this is very cool memory! Too bad it comes only as i7 kit, third module will collect dust... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
No,<br />
<br />
Fairly busy atm but I will see if I can aquire a set for testing in the near future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cele glad your happy with a set of high end ram guranteed to do spec on AMD :up:<br />
<br />
As far as the extra module, If you buy a second set you have 3 sets you can match for amd ;) Or you can sell off a pair, keep one set for benching and one set for your 24/7 rig.<br />
<br />
As far as packaging I would far rather any manufacturer save on the bling and put it where it matters, quality control :)<br />
<br />
I have tried to talk a few manufacturers into a 2x2 gig AMD kit but the market is small so not very cost effecient for them :(</div></div><hr />

By the timings your seeing those sounds like elpida BBSE. better off to drop to 8-8-8 and run them up speed wise.......sets I tested would do 1800.<br />

Yah now only if we could get a manfacurer to sell a set cheaper, maybe something that doesn't make the cut for 1866 on intel but can pull say 1800 on AMD.<br />

It's good Corsair uses Hyper ICs on their 2000C8 kit, unlike some other manufacturers who are using BBSE on their own kits. To be honest I'm expecting nothing less for the price....</div></div><hr />

<br />
90 ns may be a tad agressive for 24/7 use with them, benching should be fine though, I think  max you can give without voiding warranty is .05 over to compensate for mobos undervolting but don't quote me on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to hear that Mav, I did have to give them +.1v, but the SS I posted above is quite stable on my C3. I have a DMM temp sensor between the sticks and they never go over 43c, so I'm not too worried... ;)<br />
I think the IMC on the C3's is a little better than the C2's.<br />
<br />
90 ns may be a tad agressive for 24/7 use with them, benching should be fine though, I think but don't quote max you cam give withoutvoiding warranty is .05 over to compensate for mobos undervolting but don't quote me on that.<br />
<br />
Thanks Bro! I'm still trying to tweak two things at once...<br />
The C3 and the Mem are both new, so I'm trying to find the balance.<br />

<br />
Daveburt714  - I was wondering which kit you had, I just noticed that yours were not the AMD specific ones.<br />
<br />
My kit were these ones: http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/memory/ocz_ddr3_pc3_12800_platinum_amd_edition<br />
<br />
While the ones you linked to were these:<br />
http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/memory/ocz_ddr3_pc3_12800_platinum_amd_edition<br />
<br />
Not sure if its just marketing but was wondering if the AMD ones did work better than the other platinums made due to different IC's. Looks like the only difference is the volts 1.70 vs 1.65?<br />
<br />
When I picked mine up I almost grabbed the other platinums but made sure I got the AMD's ones to see if there was a difference and also it was hard to get at that time and doesnt look like you can get them anywhere anymore...</div></div><hr />

The IMC get blamed far too often for my liking when something is not right.<br />
<br />
The memcontroller can handle 1800 CAS 7 when tweaked right and i have seen even higher than that.<br />

Because i've had that ram myself i know it just does not run the rated specs at 1.65V!<br />
<br />
Raise Dram ref voltage some, just start of with +12.5mV and you shoud see some improvement-- tweak from there. ;)<br />
<br />
Mine needed 1.68V for stable operation at 1600 7-7-7 with tuned Dram ref voltage, without that it needed 1.73V<br />
<br />
If you ran memtest86, blockmove is test 5, having that one failing on you is 99% sure ram related.<br />
<br />
Check out the OCZ support section on this board and search for the ram you have, you will see there were more guys having the same problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse me for my ignorance, but how exactly can you tweak the memory controller?<br />
In the MA790XT there's no &quot;Dram ref voltage&quot; option, only DDR voltage, there's no &quot;Drive strengths&quot; either... so the only other tweak I know is to raise the NB Vid voltage, but how much is too much?<br />
<br />
I'm only asking because I have similar problems with the same board and memory.<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I had to drop the ratio, from 1:4 to 3:10 and up the fsb. Or maybe the beta bios did the trick. I think 1700+ is doable... it booted at 1700 and even at 1800 at 1.65v, but then turned flaky. The ram sticks were hot to the touch (hot day too - damn summer is coming), so probably needs some active cooling. Although not sure these sticks can handle 1.65 24/7 which is what I am after. I'll keep at it as time permits. Just 1 question for anyone knowledgable... are boosting drive strengths useful for DDR3?</div></div><hr />

I actually meant tweaking ram timings as well as drive strength values.<br />
<br />
If you can't adjust dram ref voltage you might be able to gain some with drive strength.<br />
<br />
If all else fails the only thing left is cranck up Vdimm.<br />
<br />
Raising NB Vid does nothing for ram clocks.</div></div><hr />

Alright, AOD has the options to change drive strengths, but where do you start?<br />
And last but not least, how much voltage is safe in these OCZ low volts kits?<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, where did you guys noticed vmem droop on this mobo? Actually it overvoltage mine ram. Set 1.7V and u get 1.75V in DMM, 1.75 and I got an 1.81V!  <br />
<br />
About the RAM:<br />
<br />
No way to get it stable working on Cas7 using 1333Mhz divider but what about Cas6 @ 1600Mhz when using 1066Mhz divider?<br />
<br />
Even in this setting there is no way to match TRCD and TRP w/ the CAS there must be an 9 in TRCD to pass 1500Mhz, and unless an 7 for TRP.<br />
<br />
Stability Gains can be observed when using higher voltage, anyway I only tested till 1.85V in bios wich actually gave me 1.90V (DMM). thats the only way to get it stable @1600Mhz  6-9-7. By the way I can use 1.75V and get 1600@ 6-9-8 1T.<br />
<br />
Any hint of wich chips are them? I've paid like US$135 for 2x 2GB of them. Already in Brasil.<br />

<br />
  AMD isnt like intel, were you can slap a pair of 2000 cas 8 sticks and get 2100 out of them, there is a limit of like 1910mgz or close to it, where you just cant go any higher on AMD.</div></div><hr />
