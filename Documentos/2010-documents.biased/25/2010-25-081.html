<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color:#003300;">Facts Debunk Global Warming Alarmism </span></h3>
<div id="article" class="module-content">
<p class="intro">22 September 2009</p>
<p class="intro">THE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that October in the US was marked by 63 record snowfalls and 115 lowest-ever temperatures.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, similar signs of colder than usual weather have been recorded all over the world, causing many people to question the still fashionable, but now long outdated, global warming alarmism. Yet individual weather events or spells, whether warmings or coolings, tell us nothing necessarily about true climate change.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, by coincidence, growing recognition of a threat of climatic cooling is correct, because since the turn of the 21st century all real world, long-term climate indicators have turned downwards. Global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002. Some people, still under the thrall of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change&#8217;s disproved projections of warming, seem surprised by this cooling trend, even to the point of denying it. But why?</p>
<p>There are two fundamentally different ways in which computers can be used to project climate. The first is used by the modelling groups that provide climate projections to the IPCC. These groups deploy general circulation models, which use complex partial differential equations to describe the ocean-atmosphere climate system mathematically. When fed with appropriate initial data, these models can calculate possible future climate states. The models presume (wrongly) that we have a complete understanding of the climate system.</p>
<p>GCMs are subject to the well-known computer phenomenon of GIGO, which translates as &#8220;garbage in, God&#8217;s-truth out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alternative computer projections of climate can be constructed using data on past climate change, by identifying mathematical (often rhythmic) patterns within them and projecting these patterns into the future. Such models are statistical and empirical, and make no presumptions about complete understanding; instead, they seek to recognise and project into the future the climate patterns that exist in real world data.</p>
<p>In 2001, Russian geologist Sergey Kotov used the mathematics of chaos to analyse the atmospheric temperature record of the past 4000 years from a Greenland ice core. Based on the pattern he recognised in the data, Kotov extrapolated cooling from 2000 to about 2030, followed by warming to the end of the century and 300 years of cooling thereafter.</p>
<p>In 2003, Russian scientists Klyashtorin and Lyubushin analysed the global surface thermometer temperature record from 1860 to 2000, and identified a recurring 60-year cycle. This probably relates to the Pacific decadal oscillation, which can be caricatured as a large scale El Nino/La Nina climatic oscillation. The late 20thcentury warming represents the most recent warm half-cycle of the PDO, and it projects forwards as cooling of one-tenth of a degree or more to 2030.</p>
<p>In 2004, US scientist Craig Loehle used simple periodic models to analyse climate records over the past 1000 years of sea-surface temperature from a Caribbean marine core and cave air temperature from a South African stalactite. Without using data for the 20th century, six of his seven models showed a warming trend similar to that in the instrumental record over the past 150 years; and projecting forward the best fit model foreshadows cooling of between 0.7 and 1 degree Celsius during the next 20-40 years. In 2007, the 60-year climate cycle was identified again, by Chinese scientists Lin Zhen-Shan and Sun Xian, who used a novel multi-variate analysis of the 1881-2002 temperature records for China. They showed that temperature variation in China leads parallel variation in global temperature by five-10 years, and has been falling since 2001. They conclude &#8220;we see clearly that global and northern hemisphere temperature will drop on century scale in the next 20 years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most recently, Italian scientist Adriano Mazzarella demonstrated statistical links between solar magnetic activity, the length of the Earth day (LOD), and northern hemisphere wind and ocean temperature patterns. He too confirmed the existence of a 60-year climate cycle, and described various correlations (some negative). Based on these correlations, Mazzarella concludes that provided &#8220;the observed past correlation between LOD and sea-surface temperature continues in the future, the identified 60-year cycle provides a possible decline in sea-surface temperature starting from 2005, and the recent data seem to support such a result&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thus, using several fundamentally different mathematical techniques and many different data sets, seven scientists all forecast that climatic cooling will occur during the first decades of the 21st century. Temperature records confirm that cooling is under way, the length and intensity of which remains unknown.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of this, governments across the world &#8211; egged on by irrational, deep Green lobbying &#8211; have for years been using their financial muscle and other powers of persuasion to introduce carbon dioxide taxation systems. For example, the federal Labor government recently spent $13.9million on climate change advertising on prime time television and in national newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>Similarly, the London-based Institute for Public Policy Research advised the British Government &#8220;ultimately, positive climate behaviours need to be approached in the same way as marketeers approach acts of buying and consuming &#8230; It amounts to treating climate-friendly activity as a brand that can be sold. This is, we believe, the route to mass behaviour change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Introduction of a carbon dioxide tax to prevent (imaginary) warming, euphemistically disguised as an emissions trading scheme, is a politician&#8217;s, ticket clipper&#8217;s and mafia chief&#8217;s dream. All will welcome a new source of income based on an invisible, colourless, odourless, tasteless and often unmeasurable gas. No commodity changes hands during its trading, and should carbon dioxide emissions actually decrease because of the existence of a carbon dioxide market (which is highly unlikely), the odds are that it will have no measurable effect on climate anyway. Nonetheless, the glistening pot of gold which beckons to be mined from the innocent public is proving nigh irresistible, and it is going to need a strong taxpayer revolt to stop it in Australia.</p>
<p>The present global financial crisis should be inducing politicians not to squander money on non-solutions to non-problems. Yet to support their plans for emissions taxation Western governments, including ours, are still propagating scientifically juvenile greenhouse propaganda underpinned only by circumstantial evidence and GCM computer gamesmanship.</p>
<p>Perhaps a reassessment will finally occur when two-metre thick ice develops again on Father Thames at London Bridge, or when cooling causes massive crop failure in the world&#8217;s granary belts.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>An obvious argument I forgot in my first post, <a href="http://readnsay.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/vote-of-no-confidence-for-temperature-charts/" target="_blank">Vote of no confidence for temperature charts</a> &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<h4>No GISS measurements over water</h4>
<p>The GISS weather stations are located on land. None of these weather stations measure the temperature on 70% of the earth&#8217;s surface which is water!</p>
<p><strong>Who is GISS anyway?</strong></p>
<p>GISS is a part of NASA and stands for Goddard Institute for Space Studies. It makes sense that this is a part of NASA. What DOESN&#8217;T make sense is why a space agency is using surface mounted weather stations for evidence of climate change.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/jhansen.html"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-187" title="j_hansen" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/j_hansen.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="j_hansen" width="200" height="300" /></a>Another thing of interest about GISS is who the CEO is &#8211; Dr James Hansen, author and speaker with an alarmist approach to the climate change/ global warming argument. It is usual for people who are government employees to keep their political opinions to themselves, or at least to comment anonymously so that it cannot be attributed to the government agency they work for. Dr Hansen is a very vocal exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Government employees are meant to be apolitical. They are supposed to do their jobs to the best of their abilities and give impartial advice regardless of who is in Government.</p>
<p>This is his background copied from the official <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/jhansen.html" target="_blank">NASA GISS web page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Research Interests:</strong><br />
As a college student in Iowa, I was attracted to science and research by James Van Allen&#8217;s space science program in the physics and astronomy department. Since then, it only took me a decade or so to realize that the most exciting planetary research involves trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from anthropogenic changes of the atmospheric composition.</p>
<p>One of my research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, especially interpreting remote sounding of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and surface from satellites. Such data, appropriately analyzed, may provide one of our most effective ways to monitor and study global change on the earth. The hardest part is trying to influence the nature of the measurements obtained, so that the key information can be obtained.</p>
<p>I am also interested in the development and application of global numerical models for the purpose of understanding current climate trends and projecting humans&#8217; potential impacts on climate. The scientific excitement in comparing theory with data, and developing some understanding of global changes that are occurring, is what makes all the other stuff worth it.</p></blockquote>
<p><!-- end class=contentboxB -->He actually says, in the second paragraph, &#8220;The hardest part is trying to influence the nature of the measurements obtained, so that the key information can be obtained.&#8221;</p>
<p>To me this sounds like spin for &#8220;The hardest part is making the numbers show what I want them to&#8221;. Let&#8217;s see how long it takes for that sentence in the NASA GISS website to get changed.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, is quoted by <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24955367-5013871,00.html" target="_blank">The Australian </a>as giving a speech which attacks the Australian Government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/House/members/member.asp?id=885"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-182" title="malcolm-turnbull" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/malcolm-turnbull.jpg?w=130&#038;h=170" alt="malcolm-turnbull" width="130" height="170" /></a>unbalanced focus on an emissions trading scheme as a means of addressing man&#8217;s influence on the climate. Instead Mr Turnbull states that a Coalition Government would focus on replacing old technology with new.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An ETS is not an end to itself,&#8221; Mr Turnbull will argue. &#8220;It&#8217;s only part of the solution &#8211; one tool in the climate policy tool box and, in fact, no solution at all without new energy sources and new low-emissions technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Green Carbon Initiative will ensure Australia is able to achieve greater reductions in carbon dioxide than those proposed by Mr Rudd, at relatively low cost and with enormous additional benefits to our own country&#8217;s environment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hooray! At least part of the message is getting through to the politicians. Also, thank you to readers who have sent copies of my posts to politicians. Suddenly there is a risk-management focus on the climate change debate&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>But Mr Turnbull will assert that action on climate change is not a matter of belief or non-belief in the science but a wise exercise in risk-management.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clever political move Mr Turnbull. Most Australians ARE concerned with the environment. With our abundance of open space, Australians are probably more environmentally aware than other people.</p>
<p>However, Australians are not convinced that another socialist experiment is in anyone&#8217;s best interests. The US sub-prime mortgage market was one such experiment, and that triggered the current global economic crisis.</p>
<p>I posted on a risk management view of an ETS in <a href="http://" target="_blank">Australia headed for economic strife, but still wants a an Emissions Trading Scheme?</a></p>
<p>Personally, I support moves to actually protect our environment and have lower human impact on the world we live in &#8211; regardless of whether man-made CO2 is causing global warming. (And I still have stuff to readnsay on that topic too!)</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>New reports today quote Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as saying the current global financial crisis is due to a culture of greed, and inadequate market supervision. The following is an extract from an AAP report in The Courier Mail:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A culture of excessive risk taking &#8211; a culture of greed &#8211; a culture of excess has brought massive economic disruption to global financial markets and the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those markets had been inadequately supervised and the world had to develop warning systems to prevent it all happening again, Mr Rudd said.</p></blockquote>
<p>In amongst the doom and gloom he promises strength and compassion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We will govern with a combination of steely economic management and compassion for those who need support.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds to me like Social Security payments will increase (not per person though) and frills will be cut. It also sounds like he is talking about greater market regulation and monitoring (auditing). Hmmm &#8211; a bit of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted.</p>
<p>Due to the international nature of capital markets and financial trading, this is indeed a global financial crisis. The dominoes are still falling. Some countries will suffer more than others.</p>
<p>Sounds like a time to be creative and think outside the square.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>I have encouraged my son to ask questions. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable with the questions he asks. Tonight he saw a news item on TV about Japanese whaling. He asked some very interesting questions. As the saying goes &#8211; from the mouths of babes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-172  aligncenter" title="pilot whale mother and baby" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/dscf3166.jpg?w=468&#038;h=211" alt="pilot whale mother and baby" width="468" height="211" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Child:  Look Mum, they&#8217;re killing a whale! Why are they doing that?</p>
<p>Mum: They say so that they can do research.</p>
<p>Child: What is research?</p>
<p>Mum: Research is studying something to learn about it.</p>
<p>Child: But why do they want to kill all of the whales in Antarctica?</p>
<p>Mum: They are not killing all of them, just some. The whales aren&#8217;t necessarily in Antarctica. The whales move north when it gets colder and have their babies in the warmer water. When the babies are stronger, they move back to Antarctica.</p>
<p>Child:  But that&#8217;s not fair! I don&#8217;t understand why they want to do that.</p>
<p>Mum:  Nor do I sweetheart.</p>
<p>Child: But why don&#8217;t the whales just swim away?</p>
<p>Mum: Because the ships are very fast. Also the whales don&#8217;t expect someone to shoot a harpoon at them.</p>
<p>Child: But I&#8217;ve never seen a real whale!</p>
<p>Mum: I&#8217;ll show you some one day. I like whales too.</p>
<p>Child: I know what they could do. They could catch them on a big hook, but they&#8217;d need a really strong line. Whales can breath air. So they could catch them like fish.</p>
<p>Mum: (Realising child has seen fishing shows where they always let the fish go gently.) And then let the whales go again?</p>
<p>Child: Yes, like fish.</p>
<p>Mum: That&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Child then proceeds to design and build a ship that catches whales, takes them inside to study them (because whales can breath air like people do), and then lowers them back into the sea in special boats to let them go again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t you wish the problems of the world could be solved that easily? Hmmm. Maybe they could.</p>
<p>These questions tugged at me because I have had the totally awesome experience of swimming with whales that happened to cross the path of the live aboard dive boat I was on. The dive boat tender dropped us as snorkellers in the path of the pod of whales and then retreated. Another swimmer and I were only metres apart and a baby whale swam right between us, checking us out and talking in whale song &#8211; under the watchful eye of his mother only about 10 metres away. The photo was taken by a friend &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have a waterproof camera on that trip.</p>
<p>I have read that only one or two tests that researchers want to do on whales can only be done on dead whales. In industry it is called destructive testing.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>I was immediately drawn to the headlines such as &#8220;Move north to escape climate change&#8221; this morning. Being a born sceptic, I looked up Australian National University&#8217;s website to see what Dr Burrows said. This is what I found, headlined <a href="http://news.anu.edu.au/?p=905" target="_blank">&#8220;New Ice Age maps point to climate change&#8221;:</a></p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>New climate maps of the Earth’s surface during the height of the last Ice Age support predictions that northern Australia will become wetter and southern Australia drier due to climate change.</p>
<p>An international consortium of scientists from 11 countries has produced the maps, which appear in this week’s issue of Nature Geoscience.</p>
<p>Dr Timothy Barrows of the Research School of Earth Sciences at The Australian National University was responsible for the Australian sector of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>“During the last Ice Age – around 20,000 years ago – sea surface temperature was as much as 10 degrees colder than present and icebergs would have been regular visitors to the southern coastline of Australia,” Dr Barrows said.</p>
<p>The temperature was estimated by measuring changes in abundance of tiny plankton fossils preserved on the sea floor, together with chemical analyses of the sediment itself.</p>
<p>“One of our major findings was that the continent’s mid latitudes (Canberra, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney) are very sensitive and experience the greatest climate change in and out of Ice Ages. This is where we should focus monitoring and look at past impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>“In contrast, the tropical areas (north of Brisbane) change very little, mostly less than 2 degrees.” </p>
<p>The global warming at the end of the last Ice Age was the greatest in recent geological history. Temperatures warmed by as much as 6-10 degrees across Australia.</p>
<p>‘We expect that the same pattern of change will hold for future global warming, with the temperate latitudes changing the most and the tropics changing the least,” Dr Barrows said. “It should be wetter in the tropics and drier in the south as climate belts shift.”</p>
<p>“Recently we have found that right at the end of the last Ice Age, temperatures were actually warmer than they are now in the southwest Pacific Ocean. We still do not know the reason for this.</p>
<p>“The study highlights how important researching past climate change is to understanding patterns of modern climate change. It’s crucial that Australia commit more resources so we can continue this vital work.”</p></div>

<p>I particularly liked the comment: &#8220;The study highlights how important researching past climate change is to understanding patterns of modern climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAP on The <a href="http://www.news.com.au/" target="_blank">News.com.au</a> website report a bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent debate has focussed on whether humans are now causing the world to warm by releasing lots of carbon dioxide.<br />
Dr Burrows said this was not his area of expertise, but there was more research to be done on how much of the recent warming was caused by humans.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m not a climate change denier but we need to be cautious about what does change our climate,&#8221; he said.<br />
Dr Burrows said the climate should be cooling as the world headed for another ice age in 20,000 years time. So if temperatures were rising, that was alarming.<br />
&#8220;If we put enough CO2 in the atmosphere we&#8217;ll prevent an ice age happening.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How much is &#8220;enough&#8221;?</p>
<p>Do we really want an Ice Age anyway?</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">The Australian economy has held up pretty well against the storm of the global financial crisis, but it appears the financial crisis is starting to bite here too. China’s economy is slowing, which will reduce our exports of resources. It is the resources boom which has insulated Australia from the bulk of the global economic storm so far.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">I published this graph in a previous post, <a href="http://readnsay.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/how-an-ets-would-create-economic-chaos/" target="_blank">How an ETS would create economic chaos</a> to indicate Australia’s recent dependence upon resource mining. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"> <a href="http://readnsay.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/how-an-ets-would-create-economic-chaos/"><img class="size-full wp-image-164  aligncenter" title="australian-exports1" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/australian-exports1.gif?w=551&#038;h=336" alt="australian-exports1" width="551" height="336" /></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Any commercial enterprise with this type of graph of its product mix would have identified this as a commercial risk and acted to mitigate the risk of the main product line going sour for some reason. These actions might include investing in value adding from that product, increasing sales in other existing product lines, not locking in investment in this product line too far in the future, while ensuring that product can be supplied for as long as there is demand for it …….. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Another risk mitigation strategy would be to ensure that the business does not place critical reliance on the cash flow from this one major product. Australia has not made the most of any of these risk mitigating opportunities. Therefore as the demand for our resources slows, we are going to feel a bit of a pinch.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Fortunately this slow down shouldn’t last too long. The world’s financial industry is starting to settle in corrective and remedial action. This will take time to come around, but it will. The upturn will be gradual though, as finance and credit will become available again a bit at a time, not in one wave of a magic wand. In the meantime industry needs to slow activity until the financial markets get back onto firmer ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Imagine though if the downturn in industry was imposed for ten years? That is what Australia is facing with the <em>cap, tax and (one day) trade</em> Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is our boom and bread and butter industries – mining and agriculture – that will feel the main impacts. Industry will take time to implement the cleaner technologies, once they become technically realistic and cost effective. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Industry invests less in R&amp;D and innovation in a downturn because most efforts and money are spent on ensuring survival. No sense investing heavily in next generation technology if the risk you won’t be around next year is getting uncomfortable. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Also, government invests less in innovation when tax revenue falls. Social security, health, education, policing and security are basic services expected of a government in a developed country. It is the other areas in which there is more flexibility in spending, and that is where the cuts will be made.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;">Hopefully the policy makers are reviewing their strategy regarding CPRS already. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="font-size:small;font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="color:#000080;">What would you do if you were part of the government policy making team? What risk mitigation strategies and policy changes would you be taking now?</span> </span></p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>How can a person have confidence in the global warming caused by CO2 emissions theory when the temperature <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-159" title="j0437711" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/j0437711.gif?w=111&#038;h=195" alt="j0437711" width="111" height="195" />charts seem to be so full of discrepancies, bad data, data cleansing, poor placement of measuring equipment and indications of political manipulation?</p>
<p>One of my favourite blogs is <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/" target="_blank">WattsUpWithThat</a> because I am amazed at the number of problems there seem to be with what I would have expected was very straight forward basic data.</p>
<h4>Placement of weather stations</h4>
<p> Weather stations are often placed at airports. This makes sense on an efficiency basis, because aircraft pilots need weather information for take-off and landing. However, they are not great places for getting temperature data. Planes create heat from their engines. Runways are upgraded from grass to bitumen. Carparks are built and expanded. Buildings are built up and airconditioners and other heat creating plant built in.</p>
<p>Many other weather stations are in urban centres. This also makes sense as weather bureaus want to give weather information to the largest section of the population. However, urban centres have also become more built up &#8211; more roads, more buildings, more heat producing car engines, air conditioners, etc. A weather station placed close to a building, and/ or with new buildings and new airconitioning condensing units blowing towards them would provide higher temperature readings over time as more of the warming infrastructure is placed around it.</p>
<p>The problem here is the local environment of many weather stations have become warmer due to urbanisation, and don&#8217;t necessarily reflect climate changes.</p>
<h4> Moving weather stations to new locations</h4>
<p>From time to time the powers that be deem the existing location of a weather station to be unsuitable and relocate it elsewhere. Sometimes the new location is more suitable, sometimes less suitable. The problem here is that the readings before and after the move are no longer comparable. A move closer or further from heat sources, up or down hill, into or out of breeze ways can change the temperature readings significantly from a move of even a short distance.</p>
<h4> Change in surrounding land use</h4>
<p> A change in the use of the land in the district where the weather station is located will cause the local temperature to change over time. A change from forest to agriculture, or from agriculture to suburbia, or even suburbia to high density buiildings will change the amount of heat absorbed and reflected in the district. </p>
<h4>Old equipment or faulty equipment</h4>
<p>I have read a number of discussions about the accuracy and reliability of different types of equipment used for measuring temperature. While I admit I only understand part of it, I do understand enough that some equipment gives a warming feedback into itself by the way it has been designed. There is also the issue of calibration which I will include under human error. </p>
<h4>Human error</h4>
<p>Not all weather stations are electronically interfaced with the recording and reporting authority. Many weather stations still require physical readings by a human being. Others give electronic readouts, but the data needs to be transcribed by a human being into the database or a communications system.</p>
<p>There are gaps in some data sets because the person who is responsible for taking the readings didn&#8217;t do it that hour/ that day/ that week.</p>
<p>Temperature measuring equipment needs to calibrated by the manufacturer and/ or installer and/ or maintenance staff.</p>
<p>There are a few ways human error can come into the data. </p>
<h4>Data adjustment</h4>
<p> Apparently one doesn&#8217;t just collect all of the readings for a certain time and take the average to work out the global temperature. There is an algorithm which is used to take into account a number of factors, one of which I hope is the area covered. However, this algorithm and the data sets put into the algorithm apparently change from time to time. Possibly this is due to better understanding of how the data should be amalgamated, but it is also open to the suspicion of political interference. </p>
<h4>Change in number of weather stations</h4>
<p> The number and location of weather stations around the world changes from time to time. There is a very interesting post about the change in the number of weather stations around the world from the 1950&#8217;s through to current times at  <a href="http://www.m4gw.com:2005/m4gw/2009/01/oops_we_forgot_siberia_part_deux.html" target="_blank">M4GW</a>&#8217;s website. The figures and area quoted aren&#8217;t quite correct, but the official GISS website does report a gradual increase in the number of stations used from a few hundred in 1860 to about 3000 in 1950, then a quick increase to about 6000 in about 1970, and then a rapid drop in about 1990 from about 5000 to about 2500 stations. How does one maintain comparability of data with this degree of change in the source data set?</p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" target="_blank">graph from GISS</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/"><img class="size-full wp-image-158  aligncenter" title="giss-weather-stations" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/giss-weather-stations.gif?w=468&#038;h=121" alt="giss-weather-stations" width="468" height="121" /></a></p>
<p>Another interesting point is that there is much greater coverage of the northern hemisphere than of the southern hemisphere. Don&#8217;t two halves make a whole?</p>
<h4>Different data sets used for different charts</h4>
<p>There are different collections of temperature data, and each one gives a different picture. The best trick I have heard of yet is the allegation that IPCC stitched together the data up to about 1980 from one data set and the data from another source from 1980. This resulted in the famous &#8220;hockey stick&#8221; graph which purported to show the planet has been warming at an alarming rate. The recent trend in the graph was then extrapolated to show that in about 100 years time the global temperature would go through the roof. Such stunts do not do anything for public confidence in the global warming theory, particularly when it came from the IPCC. </p>
<h4>Ignoring or removing readings</h4>
<p> A couple of places in the US have recorded the lowest temperature ever. Watts Up With That website is concerned that these lowest ever readings have been struck from the official record -</p>
<p><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/17/all-time-low-temperature-record-for-illinois-called-into-question-by-nws-citing-lack-of-confidence-in-equipment-is-misguided/">http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/17/all-time-low-temperature-record-for-illinois-called-into-question-by-nws-citing-lack-of-confidence-in-equipment-is-misguided/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/17/the-pain-in-maine/">http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/01/17/the-pain-in-maine/</a></p>
<p> The above problems are with regard to weather stations which measure surface temperature.</p>
<p> Satellite data is now available. Satellites measure the temperature in the lower atmosphere, not surface temperatures, so one would expect the raw data to be different, but the trends should be the same. However, can one have confidence in the published data from that source? How much of the planet is covered by these temperature readings? How often are temperatures measured at each point? What data &#8220;adjustment&#8221; is applied to these readings?</p>
<p>Has anyone got the answers to these questions?</p>

<p>Why is almost every negative event blamed on climate change? Times on line has an article <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872175,00.html" target="_blank">The US Airways Crash: A Growing Bird Hazard</a> which includes the comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; habitat destruction and climate change have disrupted migratory patterns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why on earth slip climate change in there? While we are at it, while habitat destruction is part of the problem, habitat replacement is another part. Environmentalists have busily convinced government and industry to protect or replace wildlife habitat. In some cases this has been very successful.</p>
<p>An example of government and industry replacing wildlife habitat is the <a href="http://www.portbris.com.au/environment" target="_blank">Port of Brisbane Corporation</a>. In reclaiming more land upon which to extend the Port of Brisbane, several &#8220;ponds&#8221; have been created which over the years have become a new home to dozens of species of birds, and a new resting place for migratory birds. The Port of Brisbane Corporation is very proud of their new &#8220;wetlands&#8221;, even though they were created as an accidental by-product of the port extension.</p>
<p>However, there could be a flip side to this. The Brisbane Airport is right beside the Brisbane River, and hundreds of planes a day fly over the mouth of the Brisbane River. Is another Flight 1549 incident just waiting to happen at Brisbane?</p>
<p>While it is good that wildlife have alternate habitat, it needs to be wisely placed. Being crunched by jet engines isn&#8217;t very good for birds, and could also end up being fatal for people.</p>

					<div class='snap_preview'><p>The news is full of reports of demand for oil dropping and predictions that it will continue to fall during 2009 due to <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-141" title="factory closed" src="http://readnsay.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/factory-closed1.gif?w=174&#038;h=146" alt="factory closed" width="174" height="146" />the economic crisis, such as in <a href="http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/ydzFSChTrb0/idUSTRE50F28G20090116" target="_blank">Reuters</a> 16 January 2009. The same economic factors are in play now as would be under a global emissions trading scheme, just the influence would be in a different direction. Do we want an emissions trading scheme which is the trigger for economic calamity?</p>
<p>The current global financial crisis is spreading into an economic crisis which is slowing industrial demand for a number of inputs, including energy which includes oil. Oil prices are dropping dramatically due to decreased demand for oil. The causal relationship in the current economy looks like this:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>access to finance/ credit shrinks -&gt; industrial productivity drops -&gt; consumption drops -&gt; price of oil to the producer drops</strong></span></p>
<p>Imagine a different trigger event to the finance/ credit crisis, such as an emissions trading scheme which taxes consumption of fossil fuels heavily. The causal relationship then would look like this:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">massive tax on fossil fuel consumption -&gt; cost of production increases -&gt; demand for products drops -&gt; industrial activity drops -&gt; demand for fossil fuels drops -&gt; price to the producer drops</span></strong></p>
<p>In this scenario, everyone loses, including government revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>industrial production drops</li>
<li>company tax paid to the government drops</li>
<li>unemployment increases</li>
<li>taxes paid on wages drop</li>
<li>standard of living in the developed world drops</li>
<li>carbon emissions drop a little, but not much, because poor people use carbon based fuels for heat and cooking, they can&#8217;t afford swanky solar panels on their roof (if they have a roof), they collect wood and burn it</li>
<li>clean technology innovation slows because industry can&#8217;t afford R&amp;D or upgrades when the economy slows</li>
<li>global climate keeps on doing what it was doing anyway because the solar cycle is not influenced by economics</li>
</ul>
<p>What a great scenario. In the meantime, unemployment increases and gross domestic product decreases. A fall in GDP in two successive quarters is called a recession. A fall in GDP of more than 10% is called a depression. What some countries are experiencing currently is bordering on recession, or is recession.</p>
<p>An enforced emissions trading scheme could trigger a full blown depression &#8211; a la 1930&#8217;s style. The objective of reducing carbon emissions would be achieved only by default &#8211; due to a decline in economic activity</p>
