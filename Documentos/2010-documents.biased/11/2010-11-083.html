<p>
<p>
SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of<br>
new research results and the demonstration of new  systems and<br>
techniques in  the broad field of information  retrieval (IR).<br>
The  Conference and Program Chairs  invite all those concerned<br>
with issues of IR  to submit original  research contributions,<br>
posters,  and proposals  for  tutorials,  workshops,  and<br>
demonstrations  of  systems,  for  presentation at SIGIR 2000.<br>
All contributions should be submitted to the appropriate Chair,<br>
as indicated  below (see the  Conference  web site for further<br>
details: <a href="http://sigir2000.aueb.gr">http://sigir2000.aueb.gr</a>).<br>
<p>
TOPICS<br>
Information  Retrieval  is contextual. IR functionalities form<br>
part  of  increasingly  complex  information systems serving a<br>
great  variety  of information tasks and behaviors. SIGIR 2000<br>
seeks  original  research  contributions in the broad field of<br>
information  storage  and retrieval, covering the handling  of<br>
all types of information, user behavior in information systems,<br>
and theories, models, and implementations of IR systems. Topics<br>
relevant to SIGIR include but are not limited to:<br>
<p>
* IR Theory, including logical, statistical and interactive IR<br>
  models, data fusion.<br>
* Experimentation: test collections, interactive IR experiments,<br>
  evaluation measures, experimental design, testing methodology,<br>
  scalability.<br>
* Natural  Language  Processing:  word  sense  disambiguation,<br>
  discourse analysis, summarization for the purposes of IR, use<br>
  of linguistic resources for IR.<br>
* Contextual  IR:  multi-media  IR,  cross-lingual IR systems,<br>
  speech retrieval,  dialogue  management, (non)feature-based<br>
  indexing, information seeking and task embedded IR.<br>
* Interface  issues:  user  &amp;  use  modeling,  human-computer<br>
  interaction, search strategies.<br>
* Filtering, Extraction, Routing, and Text Classification.<br>
* Systems and Implementation Issues: integration with database<br>
  systems,  networked  systems  and  the internet, compression,<br>
  efficient query evaluation.<br>
* Applications: electronic publishing,  digital libraries, text<br>
  mining, WWW-related issues, semistructured document retrieval.<br>
<p>
SIGIR 2000 IMPORTANT DATES:<br>

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br>
=======================<br>
<p>
RESEARCH PAPERS<br>
<p>
Research papers must consist of original contributions (that is,<br>
not previously published and not currently being considered for<br>
publication elsewhere) and must contain a clear statement of the<br>
problem addressed and the context in which it arises. Papers must<br>
also contain appropriate references to prior work and must indicate<br>
what contribution the work makes to the primary field of Information<br>
Retrieval. Researchers relatively new to the field of IR should<br>
get examples from, e.g., previous SIGIR conferences, the ACM <br>
Transaction on Information Systems (TOIS), the Journal of the<br>
American Society for Information Science (JASIS), etc.<br>
<p>
Papers (5 copies) should be submitted in English to the Program<br>
Co-Chair responsible for the geographic region of the first author.<br>
Papers should contain at most 5000 words. There are no formatting<br>
requirements for submissions, but do not use font sizes smaller<br>
than 10 point. The final version of the paper will have to fit<br>
within 8 double-column pages, including all figures and bibliography,<br>
so plan accordingly. Papers that are clearly longer than the limit<br>
of 5,000 words will be rejected immediately. <br>
<p>
The first page must contain the title of the paper, an abstract<br>
of not more than 150 words, and up to 6 keywords taken from the<br>
list at the end of this Call for Submissions. No page in the paper,<br>
including the first page, should indicate the author(s) or their<br>
affiliation(s). The purpose of omitting author names and affiliations<br>
is to facilitate blind reviewing. Therefore, authors should make an<br>
attempt to disguise who they are if possible, by omitting<br>
acknowledgements in the submitted version of the paper, and by<br>
refraining from phrases such as<br>
  "In our earlier work [cite author-name] ..."<br>
Authors should cite their work when required but attempt not to<br>
make it obvious that the cited work is their own, if possible. <br>
<p>
Please indicate if the paper is to be considered for the Best<br>
Student Paper Award. This Award requires that the first and primary<br>
author be a fulltime student at time of submission, that he or she<br>
is responsible for much of the work, and that he or she will present<br>
the paper should it be accepted.<br>
<p>
In addition, authors must provide a separate cover page with the<br>
title, the author name(s), the author affiliation(s), the same<br>
list of keywords as on the first page, plus complete contact<br>
information (mailing address, telephone, fax, and e-mail) for the<br>
author to whom correspondence should be sent. All correspondence<br>
with the authors will be through email. The information on this<br>
cover page must also be sent by email to the respective regional<br>
Program Co-Chair. Submissions must arrive before 21 January 2000.<br>

REVIEWING PROCESS:<br>
The  SIGIR  2000  Programme  Committee  is  organized with an<br>
International  Programme  Committee (IPC) and three  Regional<br>
Programme  Committees (RPC). Both the  IPC and  the RPCs  are<br>
designed to reflect the broadening topic areas of IR research.<br>
The reviewing process for SIGIR 2000 will  be  in  two stages.<br>
There will first be initial reviews by at least three members<br>
of the RPCs for each submission. For each paper, an IPC member<br>
will be responsible for producing a review and recommendation<br>
integrating the three initial reviews. All submissions will be<br>
refereed "blind",  that is,  without  identification  of their<br>
authors.  For  further information  on the  requirements  for<br>
submission of contributions, and evaluation criteria, see the<br>
Conference web site: <a href="http://sigir2000.aueb.gr">http://sigir2000.aueb.gr</a>.<br>
