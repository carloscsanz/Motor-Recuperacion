<title>How Aircraft Fly</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="How Aircraft Fly">
<meta name="description" content="Airplanes fly when the movement of air across their wings creates an upward force on the wings (and thus the rest of the plane) that is greater than the force of gravity pulling the plane toward the earth. The physics behind this phenomenon was first described by Daniel Bernoulli, an 18th century Swiss mathematician and scientist who studied the movement of fluids. Bernoulli discovered that the pressure exerted by a moving fluid is inversely proportional to the speed of the fluid. In other words, fluid pressure decreases as fluid speed increases, and vice versa.">

		<h1>How Aircraft Fly</h1>
		<p><b>The Bernoulli Principle</b></p>
		<p>
		Airplanes fly when the movement of air across their wings creates an 
		upward force on the wings (and thus the rest of the plane) that is 
		greater than the force of gravity pulling the plane toward the earth.<p>The physics behind this phenomenon was first described by Daniel 
		Bernoulli, an 18th century Swiss mathematician and scientist who studied 
		the movement of fluids. Bernoulli discovered that the pressure exerted 
		by a moving fluid is inversely proportional to the speed of the fluid. 
		In other words, fluid pressure decreases as fluid speed increases, and 
		vice versa.<p>The same principle applies to moving air. The faster that air moves 
		through a space, the lower the air pressure; the slower it moves, the 
		higher the pressure. Aircraft wings are designed to take advantage of 
		that fact and create the lift force necessary to overcome the weight of 
		the aircraft, and get airplanes off the ground. The undersides of wings 
		are more or less flat, while their tops are curved. In addition, wings 
		are slanted slightly downward from front to back, so air moving around a 
		wing has a longer way to travel over the top than it does underneath. 
		The air going over the top moves faster than the air going underneath, 
		and the air pressure above the wing thus is lower than it is under the 
		wing, where slower moving air molecules bunch together. The pressure 
		differential creates lift, and the faster the wing moves through the 
		air, the greater the lift becomes, eventually overcoming the force of 
		gravity upon the aircraft.<p><b>The Phases of Flight</b><p><b>Push-Back and Taxi-Out</b><p>This first phase of flight, after all doors have been secured, involves 
		the movement of the aircraft away from the terminal jetway and along 
		taxiways to a runway. A motorized vehicle called a tug sometimes is used 
		to push the aircraft back from its gate. At some airports, certain 
		aircraft are permitted to power back. This means that following engine 
		start at the gate, the thrust reversers are used to literally back the 
		aircraft away from the gate. The aircraft then moves under its own power 
		along the taxiways. Since aircraft are designed primarily for flight, 
		and are not ground vehicles, they are taxied at very low speeds. 
		Push-back occurs only when the pilot has clearance to do so from Air 
		Traffic Control, which monitors all aircraft movements during taxi.<p>
		<b>Takeoff and Climb</b><p>When ready for takeoff, and cleared by Air Traffic Control to proceed, 
		the pilot or first officer of an aircraft releases the brakes and 
		advances the throttle to increase engine power to accelerate down the 
		runway. Once aligned on the runway, steering the aircraft is normally 
		accomplished by using foot pedals that manipulate the nose wheel until 
		the speed is sufficient enough that wind rushing by the rudder on the 
		aircraft tail makes nose wheel steering unnecessary.<p>As the aircraft gains speed, air passes faster and faster over its wings 
		and lift is created. Instruments onboard the aircraft display this 
		airspeed, which equals not only the speed of the plane relative to the 
		ground, but also the speed of any wind that may be blowing toward the 
		aircraft (aircraft normally take off headed into the wind). When the 
		airspeed reaches a certain predetermined point known as rotation speed, 
		the pilot manipulates panels on the tail of the aircraft to rotate the 
		nose of the plane upward. This creates even stronger lift and the plane 
		leaves the ground.<p>Rotation speed, abbreviated VR, is one of three important airspeed 
		settings calculated before every flight. The others are V1 - the speed 
		beyond which a safe stop on a runway is no longer possible; and V2 - the 
		minimum speed needed to keep a plane flying should an engine fail after 
		the aircraft surpasses V1. Some of the factors affecting VR and V2 are 
		the weight of the aircraft, the air temperature and the altitude of the 
		airport. The heavier the aircraft, the more lift, and thus speed is 
		needed to get it off the ground. Aircraft also need to go faster to fly 
		on a hot day than on a cool day. Hot air is less dense than cool air and 
		less density produces less lift for the same speed. Similarly, the 
		higher the altitude, the less dense the air. Aircraft need more speed to 
		leave the ground at a place like Denver than at a place like New York, 
		with all other factors such as weight being equal. Some of these factors 
		also are important in calculating V1, although the key factor is the 
		length of the runway that is being used.<p>Most large jets leave the ground at about 160 miles per hour and 
		initially climb at an angle in excess of 15 degrees. The angle of a 
		plane's wings to the air flowing around them is extremely important to 
		maintaining lift. If the so-called angle of attack is too severe, the 
		flow of air around the wings becomes disrupted and the plane loses lift.<p>To make an aircraft more aerodynamically efficient, the wheels on which 
		an aircraft rolls when it is on the ground are retracted into a cavity 
		in the belly of the plane after it is airborne. There is less drag (wind 
		resistance), and an aircraft can fly faster when its landing gear is 
		retracted.<p><b>Cruise</b><p>Once a plane is in the air, it continues to climb until it reaches its 
		cruising altitude, which is determined by the pilot and must be approved 
		by Air Traffic Control. At this point, power is reduced from the setting 
		that was needed to climb, and the aircraft maintains a consistent, level 
		altitude. To fly level, the weight of the aircraft and the lifting force 
		generated by the wings are exactly equal.<p>There is no standard altitude for cruising. Generally, it is around 
		35,000 feet, but that can vary considerably depending on length of 
		flight, weather conditions, air turbulence and the location of other 
		planes in the sky. Cruising speeds are at a constant mach number, about 
		82 percent of the speed of sound. This translates to a groundspeed of 
		about 550 miles per hour, although that too can vary considerably with 
		headwinds, tailwinds and other factors.<p>During flight, pilots normally follow designated airways, or highways in 
		the sky, that are marked on flight maps and are defined by their 
		relationship to radio navigation beacons, whose signals are picked up by 
		the aircraft. Some jets also have inertial navigation systems onboard to 
		help pilots find their way. These computer-based systems calculate the 
		plane's position from its point of departure, by closely tracking its 
		heading, speed and other factors after it leaves the gate. Some aircraft 
		also are capable of using signals from a constellation of satellites to 
		pinpoint their position. This is known as the Global Positioning System. 
		Commercial aircraft are increasingly using it. GPS enables aircraft to 
		operate, with the permission of Air Traffic Control, to operate safely 
		off predetermined airways. This capability makes for more efficient 
		operations and adds capacity to the aviation system.<p>Pilots control and steer aircraft in flight by manipulating panels on 
		the aircraft wings and tail. Those control surfaces are described in 
		greater detail later in this chapter.<p><b>Descent and Landing</b><p>In this phase of a flight, the pilot gradually brings the aircraft back 
		toward the ground, by reducing engine power and speed, and thus the 
		force of the lift. The so-called final approach begins several miles 
		from the airport. By this point, Air Traffic Control has put the 
		aircraft in a sequence to land, carefully separating it from all other 
		aircraft headed for, or leaving, the same airport. The landing gear is 
		lowered, slowing the plane further. In addition, panels at the trailing 
		edge of the aircraft's wings, known as flaps, are manipulated to 
		increase drag and thus reduce speed and altitude. Other panels, known as 
		elevators, and the rudder are used (as they are throughout the flight) 
		to steer the plane and keep it on the localizer (heading) and glideslope 
		(glidepath), the continuous radio signals the flight crew will follow to 
		the end of the runway.<p>Airline aircraft generally are traveling at about 120 miles per hour 
		relative to the ground when they touch down. The flight crew then slows 
		the aircraft quickly with several actions: pulling back on the 
		throttles, raising yet another set of panels on the top of the wings, 
		called spoilers, that disrupt airflow and increase wind resistance, 
		reversing the thrust of the engines, and, of course, applying the 
		brakes.<p><b>Taxi-In and Parking</b><p>The final phase of a flight is a reverse of the first phase. The 
		aircraft is driven at slow speed under its own power onto the taxiway 
		and from there to a gate. Since most gates are equipped with moveable 
		jetways, or covered ramps, aircraft generally are parked under their own 
		power.<p><b>Major Parts of an Aircraft</b><p><b>Fuselage</b><p>This is the main body of an aircraft, exclusive of its tail assembly, 
		wings and engines. The term derives from a French word, fusele, meaning 
		tapered, because the fuselage is the shape of a long cylinder with 
		tapered ends. It is made of aluminum sections that are riveted together, 
		and inside are three primary sections: the cockpit, the cabin (which 
		often is subdivided into two or three sections with different seating 
		arrangements and different classes of service) and the cargo hold.<p><b>Cockpit</b><p>The cockpit is the most forward part of the fuselage and contains all 
		the instruments needed to fly the plane. Sometimes referred to as the 
		flight deck, the cockpit has seats for the pilot and co-pilot; a flight 
		engineer, on some planes; and seats for one or two observers that could 
		be from the airline itself, or from FAA. The cockpit is off limits to 
		passengers during flight and to flight attendants during takeoffs and 
		landings.<p><b>Cabin</b><p>The cabin is the section of the fuselage behind (and below in the case 
		of the double-deck Boeing 747) the cockpit, where an airline carries 
		passengers, freight, or both, in the case of a combination carrier. A 
		typical passenger cabin has galleys for food preparation; lavatories; 
		one or more seating compartments, closets and overhead bins, for stowing 
		baggage, coats, and other things carried onto the plane by passengers; 
		and several doors to the outside, most of which are used only for 
		emergency evacuations. The number of exits is determined by the number 
		of seats. Small jets carry about 60 passengers, the larger ones like the 
		Boeing 747 can carry more than 400.<p><b>Cargo Hold</b><p>This is the area of the fuselage below the passenger deck where cargo 
		and baggage are carried. It is basically the lower half of the fuselage 
		cylinder. It is pressurized, along with the rest of the fuselage, and 
		has heating systems for areas designated for the carriage of live 
		animals. Aircraft also have ventilation systems that force air into 
		these areas. Access to the cargo holds is through doors in the belly of 
		the aircraft. There is no access from the cabin area.<p><b>Wings</b><p>The wings are the airfoil that generates the lift necessary to get and 
		keep, an aircraft off the ground. Like the fuselage to which they are 
		attached, they are made of aluminum alloy panels riveted together. The 
		point of attachment is the aircraft's center of gravity, or balance 
		point.<p>Most jet aircraft have swept wings, meaning the wings are angled back 
		toward the rear of the plane. Swept wings produce less lift than 
		perpendicular wings, but they are more efficient at high speeds because 
		they create less drag.<p>Wings are mostly hollow inside, with large compartments for fuel. On 
		most of the aircraft in service today, the wings also support the 
		engines, which are attached to pylons hung beneath the wings.<p>Wings are designed and constructed with meticulous attention to shape, 
		contour, length, width and depth, and they are fitted with many 
		different kinds of control surfaces, which are described below.<p><b>Empennage</b><p>The empennage is the tail assembly of an aircraft, consisting of large 
		fins that extend both vertically and horizontally from the rear of the 
		fuselage. Their primary purpose is to help stabilize the aircraft, much 
		like the keel of a boat. In addition, they also have control surfaces 
		built into them that help the pilots steer the aircraft.<p><b>Control Surfaces</b><p>The control surfaces attached to an aircraft's wings and tail alter the 
		equilibrium of straight and level flight when moved up and down or left 
		and right. They are manipulated from controls in the cockpit. In some 
		planes, hydraulic lines connect the cockpit controls with these various 
		exterior panels. In others, the connection is electronic.<p>The rudder is a large panel attached to the trailing edge of a plane's 
		vertical stabilizer in the rear of the plane. It is used to control yaw, 
		which is the movement of the nose left or right. The rudder is used 
		mostly during takeoffs and landings to keep the nose of an aircraft on 
		the centerline of the runway. It is manipulated via foot pedals in the 
		cockpit. Jet aircraft also have automatic yaw dampers that function at 
		all times, to ensure a comfortable ride.<p>The elevators are panels attached to the trailing edge of an aircraft's 
		two horizontal stabilizers, also part of the tail assembly, or 
		empennage. The elevators control the pitch of an aircraft, which is the 
		movement of the nose up or down. They are used during flight and are 
		manipulated by pulling or pushing on the control wheel or side-stick 
		controller in the cockpit.<p>The ailerons are panels built into the trailing edge of the wings. Like 
		the elevators, they are used during flight to steer an aircraft and are 
		manipulated by turning the control wheel or side-stick controller in the 
		cockpit to the left or right. These steering motions deflect the 
		ailerons up or down, which in turn affect the relative lift of the 
		wings. An aileron deflected down increases the lift of the wing to which 
		it is attached, while an aileron deflected up decreases the lift of its 
		wing. Thus, if a pilot deflects downward the aileron on the left wing of 
		the aircraft, and defects upward the aileron on the right wing, the 
		aircraft will roll, or bank, to the right. Spoilers are panels built 
		into the top surfaces of the wings and mostly are used during landings 
		to spoil the lift of the wings and thus keep the aircraft firmly planted 
		on the ground once it touches down. They also can be used during flight 
		to expedite a descent.<p>The other major control surfaces are the flaps and slats, both designed 
		primarily to increase the lift of the wings at the slow speeds used 
		during takeoffs and landings. Flaps are mounted on the trailing edge of 
		the wings, slats on the leading edge. When extended, they increase lift 
		because they make the surface area of the wings larger and accentuate 
		the curve of the wings. Flaps also are commonly deployed during final 
		approach to increase lift, which provides control and stability at 
		slower speeds. Flap and slat settings are controlled by the pilots, 
		although automatic extension/retraction systems are sometimes provided 
		to protect flight and structural integrity.<p><b>Landing Gear</b><p>The landing gear is the undercarriage assembly that supports an aircraft 
		when it is on the ground and consists of wheels, tires, brakes, shocks, 
		axles and other support structures. Virtually all jet aircraft have a 
		nose wheel with two tires, plus two or more main gear assemblies with as 
		many as 16 tires. The landing gear is usually raised and lowered 
		hydraulically and fits completely within the lower fuselage when 
		retracted. Aircraft tires are filled with nitrogen rather than air 
		because nitrogen does not expand or contract as much as air during 
		extreme temperature changes, thus reducing the chances of a tire 
		blowout.<p><b>Engines</b><p>The exact number of engines on an airplane is determined by the power 
		and performance requirements of the aircraft. Most jet airplanes have 
		two, three or four engines, depending on aircraft size. Some have the 
		engines attached to the rear of the fuselage. Many have them mounted on 
		pylons, hanging below the wings. Some have a combination of both, with 
		an engine under each wing and one on top of the fuselage at the rear of 
		the plane.<p>The power produced by the engines is controlled by the pilots, either 
		directly or indirectly, through computerized controls. All large 
		airliners are designed to fly safely on fewer than all engines. In other 
		words, the remaining engine or engines have enough power to keep the 
		aircraft airborne.<p><b>Jet Propulsion</b><p>As mentioned above, some form of propulsion is required to move an 
		aircraft through the air and generate sufficient lift for it to fly. The 
		earliest forms of propulsion were simple gasoline engines that turned 
		propellers. Most modern airliners are equipped with jet engines, which 
		are more powerful and mechanically simpler and more reliable than piston 
		engines. Jet engines first entered commercial service in the late 1950s 
		and were in widespread use by the mid-1960s.<p>A jet engine takes in air at the front, compresses it into smaller and 
		smaller spaces, by pulling it through a series of compressor blades. 
		Then fuel is added to the hot, compressed air and ignites the mixture in 
		a combustion chamber. This produces an explosion of extremely hot gases 
		out the rear of the engine and creates a force known as thrust, which 
		propels the engine (and thus the aircraft) forward. It is the same 
		principle that propels a balloon forward when blown up with air and 
		released. The air escaping from both a balloon and a jet engine creates 
		a pressure differential between the front and back of the enclosed space 
		that results in forward movement. Importantly, as the hot gases explode 
		out the back of a jet, they turn a wheel known as a turbine. The turbine 
		is connected by a center shaft to the compressor blades at the front of 
		the engine and thus keeps the compressor spinning while the engine is 
		on.<p>As with all combustion engines, power is increased by adding more fuel 
		to the combustion chamber. Today's most powerful jet engines can produce 
		more than 90,000 pounds of thrust. Expressed another way, each of these 
		giant engines can lift 90,000 pounds straight up off the ground. Since 
		aircraft rely on their wings for vertical lift and engines only for 
		horizontal movement, these large engines can lift enormous amounts of 
		weight off the ground and power aircraft at great speeds.<p><b>Types of Jets</b><p>There are three basic types of jet engines. Turbojets are engines that 
		use exhaust thrust alone to propel an aircraft forward, as just 
		described.<p>Turbofans, or fanjets, are an improved version of the turbojet. With a 
		larger fan at the front, the turbofan pulls in more air. It also diverts 
		some of the incoming air around the combustion chamber and later mixes 
		it with the hot exhaust gases escaping out the back. This lowers the 
		temperature and speed of the exhaust, increasing thrust at lower speeds 
		and making the engine quieter.<p>The third type is the turboprop, or propjet. It uses a jet engine to 
		turn a propeller. Thrust is generated by both the propeller and the 
		exhaust gases of the jet itself. Turboprops are used on small, 
		short-range aircraft such as those often operated by commuter and 
		regional airlines. They are efficient in these types of operations, but 
		less so at the high speeds and high altitudes flown by the large 
		commercial jets.<table border="0" width="100%" id="table4" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
