to set the record straight about what the tabloids are calling a health crisis, claiming Dolly is dangerously thin.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always saying things, I&rsquo;ve lost too much weight, I&rsquo;m anorexic, we&rsquo;re worried about Dolly,&rdquo; fumed the singer. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll show a picture of me when I was heavier, then show one now, and it&rsquo;s like, hey that looks good to me!&rdquo; <br><br>Those recent headlines have made Dolly sympathetic toward Paris, Nicole and the rest of young Hollywood&rsquo;s party posse. <br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; Dolly admitted. &ldquo;I feel sorry for them.&rdquo; <br><br>But Dolly, who has been in the entertainment business for decades, has confidence Hollywood&rsquo;s young women can survive. <br><br>&ldquo;They&#39;re just young and they&#39;ll grow out of it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We all have a right to be who we are, whatever it is.&rdquo; <br><br>Dolly, who at age 61 is still making headlines, has other things to worry about besides the tabloids. <br><br>She&rsquo;s hard at work guest starring on Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hannah Montana,&rdquo;

said Parton, who was honored for writing such hits as &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;Coat of Many Colors.&quot; <br><br>Parton, already a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was given the Johnny Mercer Award by the association for her songwriting. <br><br>&quot;Throughout my whole career, I&#39;ve been known for two things,&quot; joked the singer, famous for cutting a memorable figure in cleavage-revealing, glittery outfits. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m talking about my music and my lyrics,&quot; she said. <br><br>On a more serious note, Parton, who is famous for her big voice, big wigs and big smile as well, said she would like to be remembered most for her songwriting. <br><br>&quot;It is my favorite thing to do. It is my private time with God. That&#39;s when I feel closest to God even when the songs I&#39;m writing are just God-awful,&quot; said Parton, who performed her hit &quot;9 to 5&quot; for the occasion, held at a Manhattan hotel. <br><br>Her song &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; originally released in 1974, was a hit remake by Whitney Houston for the 1992 movie &quot;The Bodyguard.&quot; <br><br>Also at the event and inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame were Jackson Browne, who wrote such hits as &quot;Rock Me on the Water&quot; and &quot;Running on Empty,&quot; and Don Black, who wrote the lyrics for &quot;Born Free,&quot; which won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1967, and &quot;To Sir With Love.&quot; <br><br>Inducted as well were Michael Masser, who wrote &quot;Touch Me in the Morning,&quot; Irving Burgie, who wrote &quot;Day-O&quot; and &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; popularized by Harry Belafonte, and the team of Bobby Weinstein and Teddy Randazzo, who wrote &quot;Goin&#39; Out of My Head&quot; and &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot; for Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials. <br><br>Songwriter and entertainer John Legend and music publisher and producer Don Kirschner also were honored. <br><br>The Songwriters Hall of Fame was founded in 1969 to celebrate and promote songwriting talent. <br><br>Previous inductees include Carole King, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Elton John, Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, James Brown, Hal David and Burt Bacharach. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Tennessean</font><br><font size="2">June 21, 2007</font><br><br><b>Academy honors Parton, other country greats</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Tennessean" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Tennessean" width="455"></div><br><br>Country music wistfully remembered some of its greatest lost talent Wednesday at the Tennessee State Museum, but the spirit was lifted by a celebration of a few of its remaining treasures. <br><br>About 250 people gathered at &quot;Sparkle and Twang: Marty Stuart&#39;s American Musical Odyssey&quot; to help the Academy of Country Music honor Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Don Williams, Buck Owens and music executive Jack Lameier. <br><br>After musical tributes by Ashley Monroe and Rhonda Vincent, Parton was presented the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award by former singing partner Porter Wagoner. <br><br>Parton joked that it was appropriate that she receive the pioneer award because she and Wagoner came to town in a covered wagon. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve seen a lot of wonderful things happen in this business, all sorts of styles, but it&#39;s always remained country music,&quot; she said. <br><br>&quot;I like feeling like I&#39;m one of the old-timers in the business, but I&#39;m out there every day. <br><br>&quot;I may be a pioneer, but I&#39;m blazing new trails all the time, so don&#39;t give up on me,&quot; said Parton, who was recording in the studio earlier Wednesday. <br><br>Ray Scott honored Jennings by singing &quot;Rainy Day Woman&quot; and Buddy Jennings accepted his late father&#39;s Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. <br><br>&quot;I think it&#39;s long overdue,&quot; Buddy Jennings said. &quot;It should&#39;ve been done when he was alive so he could enjoy it. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re finally coming around.&quot; <br><br>Tricia Yearwood sang the Patsy Cline song &quot;He Called Me Baby&quot; in honor of Pioneer Award recipient Harlan Howard. <br><br>Howard, who wrote more than 4,000 songs, was considered the dean of country songwriters. His hits include &quot;I Fall to Pieces,&quot; &quot;Busted&quot; and &quot;Heartaches by the Number.&quot; <br><br>His widow, Melanie Howard, accepted the award on his behalf. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s an honor anytime they recognize songwriters because it&#39;s hard for songwriters to compete with the likes of Dolly, Waylon and Buck,&quot; she said. <br><br>&quot;Harlan was very shy and introverted. He preferred that his songs shine for him. <br><br>&quot;He would have loved it after it was over,&quot; she said of the event. &quot;He would be at the bar before and after.&quot; <br><br>Cliffee Stone award winner Don Williams, who did not attend, was praised by former manager John Dorris and manager Robert Pratt for his body of work that included 17 number one hits such as &quot;Good Ole Boys Like Me&#39;&#39; and &quot;You&#39;re My Best Friend.&quot; <br><br>The Don Williams hit &quot;I Believe In You&quot; was performed by one of its co-writers, Roger Cook. <br><br>Williams, who is hugely popular in Europe and has toured in Australia and Africa, was lauded for the international doors he opened for country music. <br><br>&quot;I believe that Don carried the American country song across the world,&quot; Pratt said. <br><br>Buck Owens, who died last year, was given the Jim Reeves International Award for outstanding contributions to the acceptance of country music worldwide. <br><br>Connie Smith sang &quot;The Key&#39;s in the Mailbox&quot; and Marty Stuart and the Fabulous Superlatives performed an instrumental number. <br><br>Great American Country host Storme Warren discussed Owens&#39; career accomplishments, which spanned singing and songwriting to hosting television shows and owning radio stations and nightclubs. Throughout his career, he received 20 ACM nominations. <br><br>Jack Lameier, who retired from Song Music Nashville after 40 years, was given the Mae Boren Axton award, recognizing his years of dedication to the ACMs. <br><br>&quot;Mae Boren Axton always said, &#39;Put the music first,&#39; &quot; Lameier said. He was serenaded by Ty Herndon, one of his former artists. Herndon sang &quot;What Matters Most,&quot; which Lameier helped make a hit on country radio. <br><br>Herndon said Lameier persuaded more than 100 radio stations to add the song the first week of its release. <br><br>&quot;It still holds the record,&quot; Herndon said. <br><br>Tracy Lawrence and Hal Ketchum were in the audience at the event.  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">New York Post</font><br><font size="2">July 20, July</font><br><br> <div class="h3"><b>B&#39;WAY GETTING ALL DOLLY&#39;D UP</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="New York Post" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="New York Post" width="455"></div></div><br>There&#39;s pretty good buzz coming out of last week&#39;s hush-hush staged reading of &quot;Nine to Five,&quot; a musical based on the perennially popular 1980 movie about three secretaries who stick it to their boss. <br><br>Theater executives who attended the presentation were impressed with Dolly Parton&#39;s upbeat and witty score, which includes the famous title song. <br><br>The new numbers are &quot;signature Dolly songs that also work as musical theater songs,&quot; one insider says, adding: &quot;The show feels like a real Broadway musical, not one of those movies like &#39;The Wedding Singer&#39; where you just shove the songs into the screenplay.&quot; <br><br>The book is by Parton&#39;s friend Patricia Resnick, who wrote the movie. Some people say her script isn&#39;t as strong as Parton&#39;s score, but you can bet director Joe Mantello (&quot;Wicked&quot;) will crack the whip until she gets it right. <br><br>Insiders praise the three actresses who played the secretaries: &quot;West Wing&quot; alum Allison Janney, scoring big laughs in the Lily Tomlin role; Megan Hilty, doing a first-rate impersonation of Dolly (who&#39;s not in the show); and Stephanie J. Block, bouncing back spectacularly from the &quot;Pirate Queen&quot; debacle in the Jane Fonda part. <br><br>Marc Kudisch played the sleazy boss (Dabney Coleman in the movie) and hammed it up as only Kudisch can. <br><br>Parton was at the reading, standing at the back of the rehearsal hall, singing along with her songs and charming the pants off theater owners, who are eager to book a show that looks like a winner. <br><br>The first thing people notice about her is how tiny she is.<br>&quot;She has this enormous head on this little body - well, little except in one area,&quot; says a source. &quot;She looks like a Dolly Parton bobblehead.&quot; <br><br>This Dolly&#39;s no diva, by the way. Production sources say that when Mantello lets her know a number doesn&#39;t work, she tosses it out and goes right back to the keyboard. <br><br>Produced by Bob Greenblatt, who runs the Showtime network, &quot;Nine to Five&quot; is expected to open on Broadway in the 2008-2009 season. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Billboard</font><br><font size="2">August 1, 2007</font><br><b><br>Parton Launching Own Label With Country Album</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Billboard" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Billboard" width="455"></div><br><br>Country legend Dolly Parton will debut her new label, Dolly Records, with the release of a country album next February. &quot;It&#39;s really the first mainstream country record Dolly has done in 17 years,&quot; says Parton&#39;s manager, Danny Nozell, who also serves as the GM of Dolly Records. <br><br>&quot;She&#39;s going to be the only person on that label. We&#39;re not signing any other artists, it&#39;s going to be strictly for Dolly Parton,&quot; Nozell tells Billboard.com.<br>So why go independent and in-house? &quot;She&#39;s a free agent right now so we decided to go around to the majors to at least see what kind of distribution deals they were bringing in, and didn&#39;t see anything I was interested in,&quot; says Nozell, who adds that he then proceeded to put a marketing plan together on his own. <br><br>&quot;To be honest, we have the finances the major labels have, and I put together a marketing plan that was way more extensive than any major has brought to me,&quot; Nozell says. <br><br>Distribution is still being finalized, but a deal is in the works with iTunes for digital sales.

Already, the building is being used as a classroom for Belmont University&#39;s just-launched songwriting curriculum. <br><br>&quot;How do you like my pink hair?&quot; Parton asked the crowd of music industry executives and entertainment reporters wedged into a reception area to hear the announcement. Parton said she had pinked herself out (she was also wearing a pink jacket) for her forthcoming appearance on <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>. She stressed that she wouldn&#39;t be dancing herself but simply using the opportunity to debut her current iTunes single, &quot;Better Get to Livin&#39;.&quot; <br><br>Although the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1970, it has never had a physical space of its own. Collaborating on the new exhibit and songwriting area are the Mike Curb Family Foundation (which owns the building at 34 Music Square East), the Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business at Belmont University and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame Foundation. <br><br>Belmont University president Bob Fisher announced details of the songwriting curriculum and offered to create a professorship on the spot for Parton if she would like to teach in the program. <br><br>&quot;OK,&quot; said Parton skeptically. &quot;I&#39;ll keep you posted.&quot; <br><br>Currently, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame has 162 members. Six more are due to be inducted Oct. 14. <br><br>Teaching the first songwriting class of the fledgling curriculum are Thom Schuyler and Bob Regan, both of whom were present for the announcement. Schuyler has penned the hits &quot;Love Will Turn You Around,&quot; &quot;A Long Line of Love,&quot; &quot;Point of Light&quot; and the iconic &quot;16th Avenue.&quot; Regan&#39;s composing credits include &quot;Your Everything,&quot; &quot;Thinking About You,&quot; &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;Every Time I Cry.&quot; <br><br>Parton stole the spotlight as reporters pelted her with questions about her upcoming album -- it&#39;s called Backwoods Barbie -- and the impending Broadway version of her 1980 hit movie, 9 to 5. She said she wrote all the songs for the play, which is set to debut in the fall of 2009. <br><br>She added that she plans to tour Canada, Europe and possibly Australia next year. &quot;I&#39;m a gypsy at heart,&quot; she asserted. &quot;I love to be out with the people.&quot; <br><br>Retirement, said the 61-year-old bombshell, is not in her plans. &quot;I hope to fall dead on stage,&quot; she chirped, &quot;right in the middle of a song -- and hopefully one I wrote.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s quips came a mile a minute. After the press conference was over and she and the other dignitaries were posing for pictures, she noticed a photographer who seemed to be having equipment trouble. <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not flashing,&quot; she shouted. &quot;Can I help you charge your batteries?&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Asheville Citizen-Times</font><br><font size="2">November 19, 2007</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton pays whirlwind visit to Asheville<br></b><br><img align="bottom" alt="Asheville Citize-Times" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Asheville Citize-Times" width="455"></div><br><br>ASHEVILLE &ndash; Country music and movie star Dolly Parton bounded into Asheville early Monday morning to meet fans, promote her new CD and crack nonstop jokes on radio station 99.9 Kiss Country. <br><br>The Grammy-winning and Oscar-nominated singer and actress, who was raised in nearby Sevierville, Tenn., delighted a small group of loving fans who had won a radio contest to meet her.

It is hard to think anybody could. <br><br>The country star hit the headlines. over the weekend when it was revealed that council leaders had delayed a meeting by one hour in order to welcome her to the South Yorkshire town, provoking accusations that democracy was being undermined. <br><br>Yesterday Parton, 61, shrugged off the controversy with characteristic charm, saying she could wait to meet the &ldquo;sweet people&rdquo; of Rotherham, who are to be the beneficiaries of her charitable children&rsquo;s literacy scheme, the Imagination Library. <br><br>&ldquo;I will let the old codgers fight it out among themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I guess they are old codgers. I can say that because I&rsquo;m an old codger myself. <br><br>&ldquo;I never, ever get involved in politics. With politics you are not allowed to be honest. I don&rsquo;t have time to deal with that. I would rather work with kids.&rdquo; <br><br>Parton&rsquo;s unlikely link-up tomorrow has come about because the town&rsquo;s chamber of commerce went on a visit last year to Nashville organised with Athena International, an international business networking group for women. <br><br>While on the trip the council leader, Roger Stone, a country music fan, was introduced to Parton&rsquo;s Imagination Library. From there, the link between the Rhinestone queen and the former coalmining town was forged. The Imagination Library, set up in the US in 1996, is a reading scheme that involves posting children a reading book every month until the age of 5. Funded by the singer&rsquo;s Dollywood Foundation, with backing and business sponsorship from communities that sign up to the scheme, it has spread to 700 counties in 43 American states and last year opened in Canada. <br><br>Rotherham is the first place to implement the scheme in Britain. The chamber of commerce is sponsoring the cost of the books in the first year. <br><br>The scheme aims to promote the pleasure of reading. Children who cannot read and write to the expected level by the end of primary school have only a one in five chance of achieving five good GCSEs, so an early start to reading is a crucial determinant of future earnings, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research. <br><br>Separate research last week from the National Foundation for Educational Research found that the children who did best in school at the age of 10 were those who grew up in the homes with the most books. <br><br>Parton herself is an avid reader. She grew up in a home with 11 siblings where the only book was the Bible. Her own father was illiterate. &ldquo;I saw at first hand the struggle that caused,&rdquo; she has said. <br><br>The Imagination Library mirrors existing projects in the UK, such as the government-backed Book Time, run by the Booktrust charity and Pearson, the publisher, which distributes books to children when they start primary and secondary school. <br><br>Tony Mannion, the independent councillor whose outrage at the delayed council meeting sparked the controversy over Parton&rsquo;s visit, will not be attending the launch tomorrow. &ldquo;I never go to anything where there is a free lunch, or if I do go I bring my own food,&rdquo; he said. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Business Wire</font><br><font size="2">December 4, 2007<br></font><b><br></b><div class="h3"><b>Dolly Parton&#39;s Imagination Library Expands to United Kingdom</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Entertainment legend travels to London and Rotherham for announcement.</b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Business Wire" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Business Wire" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Entertainment superstar Dolly Parton was at London&rsquo;s Savoy Hotel today and travels to the Magna Science and Adventure Park in Rotherham tomorrow to announce the launch of her Imagination Library program in the United Kingdom. <br><br>Founded by Parton in 1996 as a way to inspire children in her hometown of Sevierville, Tenn., the Imagination Library provides a new, age appropriate book each month from birth until age five to registered children in participating communities. A local sponsor in each community funds the cost of the books and mailing while Parton&rsquo;s Foundation covers the overhead, selects the books, and negotiates the cost. She has created The Dollywood Foundation of the United Kingdom to manage the efforts in the UK. <br><br>Currently, 15,000 children are eligible in Rotherham. The effort is sponsored by the Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. <br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thrilled beyond my wildest dreams at how my Imagination Library has grown from my home county in the U.S., all the way across the pond to The United Kingdom,&rdquo; Parton said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say enough about the kind folks of Rotherham who invited us here, and I look so forward to working with our local partners all across the UK to give books to as many kids as possible.&rdquo; <br><br>In honor of the program&rsquo;s UK launch, Parton presented the first book in London to Rotherham&rsquo;s first registered participants. She also will pay a visit to Rotherham where she will present the first book to a newborn. Parton will conclude the day&rsquo;s activities by meeting with local and regional officials. <br><br>&ldquo;I hope that my Imagination Library will fit in well with the many other wonderful programs here who do so much to help children,&rdquo; Parton said. &ldquo;Together, we can make a huge difference in the lives of so many little ones.&rdquo; <br><br>Penguin Group UK will provide all books for the Imagination Library in the UK. Penguin Group USA supports the Imagination Library in the U.S. and Canada. In the UK, the Imagination Library is partnering with Royal Mail and the dsicmmGroup LTD mail house to distribute books. <br><br>In the United Kingdom, the first book in the 60-volume collection is Beatrix Potter&rsquo;s popular Tales of Peter Rabbit. The first books will be mailed to registered children in early 2008. <br><br>After the launch events, Parton and her Foundation hope other communities in the United Kingdom will follow Rotherham&rsquo;s lead and provide the Imagination Library to their children. <br><br>The Imagination Library currently operates in more than 700 communities in 43 states in the U.S. as well as Canada. To date, 417,000 participating children in the U.S. and Canada currently receive books, with 4.5 million books mailed this year alone. Since the program&rsquo;s inception in 1996, more than 11.6 million books have been mailed. <br><br>In 2000, Parton received an Association of American Publishers (AAP) honor. On Nov. 8, the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars awarded her its Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. <br><br>Parton recently announced new European tour dates as part of the Backwoods Barbie 2008 World Tour. The European Leg starts in Stockholm, Sweden on June 13, takes in Denmark, Norway, Holland and Ireland, culminating at the O2 Arena in London on July 5, with numerous dates in between. <br><br>Parton said, &ldquo;I had a great time when we were in Europe last tour, and I expect to have even more fun on the up and coming tour. I can&#39;t wait to see all the fans again. We have a lot of new songs from my new CD, Backwoods Barbie, and a lot of fun things for everybody.

Wearing a grey suit, the singer shouted: &quot;Well hello, everybody&quot; to a crowd of dignitaries, public and media outside the centre as she got out of her car, flanked by security guards. <br><br>She said she had been persuaded to launch the scheme in Rotherham by the leader of the council, Roger Stone, who visited Tennessee with the town&#39;s chamber of commerce and an international business group for women. <br><br>She said: &quot;I didn&#39;t know much about Rotherham other than what we heard when we started talking to Roger Stone. <br><br>&quot;He had been over to the States and found out about our programme and asked if we would bring it here to the children. <br><br>&quot;He thought it was a wonderful idea, so two years later we are here, and we are very excited about it.&quot; <br><br>She said her desire to promote childhood reading stemmed from seeing how illiteracy had disadvantaged her family. <br><br>The singer revealed how her rural Tennessee background had formed her view of how reading and writing were crucial for success in life. <br><br>&quot;My own father and mother got married when they were very young. <br><br>&quot;My father was from a very large family and never had an opportunity to actually go to school. <br><br>&quot;My father couldn&#39;t read or write as [couldn&#39;t] many of my relatives and I saw how crippling that can be. <br><br>&quot;When I got into a position to be able to do some charity work, education seemed to keep just jumping out at me.&quot; <br><br>The global singing star started the programme in her home town about 10 years ago and it has since spread across 43 states in the US. <br><br>Despite her global success and multi-million record sales, Ms Parton said she had one abiding memory of her time in a mountain shack her family called home. <br><br>&quot;I remember sitting at my mother&#39;s feet listening to all the stories she would read.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Yorkshire Post</font><br><font size="2">December 5, 2007</font><br><b><br>Superstar Dolly aims to be the &#39;book lady&#39;</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Yorkshire Post" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Yorkshire Post" width="455"></div><br><br>It&#39;s a long way from the glamour of Hollywood, or even Dollywood. But country music star Dolly Parton chose a former steel works in Rotherham to launch a scheme encouraging young children to read more books. <br><br>The 61-year-old singer&#39;s Imagination Library project aims to give each registered child a new book every month until they go to school. <br><br>Dolly Parton&#39;s drive to improve children&#39;s literacy started 10 years ago in the United States and yesterday councillors at the Magna Science Centre in Rotherham hosted the first European trial of her scheme. <br><br>The Oscar-nominated star joked with the crowd and sang two hit songs, but she stressed her reason for being in the country was to become the &quot;book lady&quot; for South Yorkshire children. <br><br>Inspired by a &quot;dirt poor&quot; childhood in Tennessee, she said her desire to get children reading stemmed from both her father&#39;s lack of school education and her own love of reading the Bible. <br><br>&quot;Even if you never get to go to school a day of your life, if you can read, you can go and find that book in a library,&quot; she said. <br><br>&quot;If a child has a book in its hands, feels it&#39;s special and believes in it, then it will learn to read it and want to touch it and make people take care of it. <br><br>&quot;I believe with all my heart that it is going to make a difference in Rotherham.&quot; <br><br>The Imagination Library project, run by the singer&#39;s Dollywood Foundation, has already posted 10 million books to children in the US and Canada and organisers hope that Rotherham&#39;s example will see it spread across Europe. <br><br>Bringing Dolly Parton&#39;s literacy scheme to Rotherham was the idea of council leader Roger Stone. He managed to persuade the busy star that the South Yorkshire town has much in common with her home town during a trip to Tennessee with the town&#39;s chamber of commerce last year. <br><br>The singer said: &quot;People in Rotherham are very warm, very friendly, I like it here better than the big cities.&quot; <br><br>The glamorous star, whose fortune is worth an estimated &pound;110m, laughed off this week&#39;s controversy about her appearance clashing with a scheduled council meeting. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;re not here to cause trouble, we&#39;re just here to do something for the little children,&quot; she said. <br><br>Mr Stone said: &quot;Having her here is unbelievably fantastic, because she has such a wow factor. I have seen her just melt people.&quot; <br><br>He added: &quot;I think she has a lot in common with Rotherham people. She comes from an industrial area and she&#39;s very down to earth.&quot; <br><br>Rotherham Chamber of Commerce chairman Rob Hannon said businesses supported improving literacy because employers increasingly saw poor standards of basic skills in job interviews. <br><br>The project is due to start handing out books in Rotherham early next year. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Metro UK</font><br><font size="2">December 5, 2007</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton&#39;s beauty tip: See a doctor</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Metro UK" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Metro UK" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton, 61, has collected more country music awards than any other female singer.

Tickets at www.livenation.co.uk. <br><br><b>Why Rotherham?</b> <br>Some folks from Rotherham visited the Tennessee tourist board last year and found out about our reading programme and asked if we&rsquo;d bring it over. Now here we are. I started the programme for children in Tennessee and now it&rsquo;s in 43 states. We&rsquo;ve distributed 11million books in the ten years we&rsquo;ve been doing it. The children get a book a month until they go to kindergarten. They have something to look forward to arriving in the mail. <br><br><b>Have you ever been to Rotherham before?</b> <br>No, it&#39;s a small area right? I think there are only 15,000 children that are going to be in the programme. It&#39;s funded by the government, businesses and people who want to invest in it. I do fund raising concerts in the states every year. Those book cost quite a bit. <br><br><b>What&rsquo;s your favourite book?</b> <br>My favourite book as a child, which we give away in the States, is The Little Engine That Could. I thought that was a great book when I was a child and now I&rsquo;m the little engine that did. That just shows it can work. <br><br><b>What&#39;s the last good book you read?</b> <br>I haven&#39;t read a good one in a while, it&#39;s hard to find great books. I&#39;ve been so busy writing. I wrote nine of the songs on my new CD and wrote the Nine To Five musical which will be coming out in 2009. So I&#39;ve been too busy to read. <br><br><b>Is there really going to be a sequel to Nine To Five?</b> <br>Not at the moment. That film is 27 years old. Lily, Jane and I would like to do some sort of movie together. We could be spies, we could be three widows up to no good. We&rsquo;ve been talking about it. The musical version of Nine To Five that I&rsquo;ve written would make a great movie one day. I&rsquo;ve been writing my own life story as a musical for several years now so maybe if Nine To Five is a success I&rsquo;ll go ahead and produce that. <br><br><b>Where are the best audiences for you?</b> <br>Europe, seriously. I hadn&rsquo;t played here for so long and didn&rsquo;t know until I did the shows last year that I had so many fans in this part of the world. You&rsquo;re never a hero at your own home. The crowds at home aren&rsquo;t nearly as good for me there, unless I&rsquo;m playing at Dollywood to all my family and friends. <br><br><b>When you started out what kind of gigs did you do?</b> <br>We used to play at a place called Donks Theatre which we used to laugh about. Even now when we play at places that aren&#39;t as good as we&#39;re used to we joke we&#39;re back playing at Donks. I played in all sorts of places, on the back of flat bed trucks, in shopping centres. All over. It&#39;s been a while but I ain&#39;t above it, I&#39;d still do it if I needed to. <br><br><b>Was Whitney Houston&rsquo;s version of I Will Always Love You over the top?</b> <br>Not for what it was. I was driving from my office to my house when I first heard it on the radio, they didn&rsquo;t send me a copy in advance. I almost had a heart attack. I had no idea it could be done that big, with that kind of orchestration. My version was simple, heartfelt and pitiful, hers was major and mighty and earned me quite a bit of money. That&rsquo;s why you write songs, to get your feelings out and hope they make money.<br> <b>When you first earned some money what did you spend it on?</b> <br>I went out and bought a new Cadillac. I&rsquo;ve had a new Cadillac every year since. Back then, all the big country stars had a Cadillac; I thought you hadn&rsquo;t made it in country music until you had one. <br><br><b>What&rsquo;s your biggest extravagance?</b> <br>My biggest extravagances are also investments. I have several houses in California, a house in Nashville, an office complex and I bought the old home place in Tennessee. They are different places for me to write but I can turn right around and sell them. <br><br><b>What are your top beauty tips?</b> <br>I always joke that all you need to do is find a good doctor. If you&rsquo;ve got the money and the nerve, if you see something sagging, bagging and dragging, go get it sucked, plucked and tucked. Just take good care of your skin. You don&rsquo;t need to buy expensive cosmetics, almost anything will do if you know how to apply it. <br><br><b>What&#39;s the best Christmas present you&#39;ve ever received?</b> <br>One of my brothers was born almost on Christmas day so as child I thought we&#39;d got our own real-life baby doll. I&#39;d always wanted a walking talking doll and so he was one of the best things I ever got around Christmas. <br><br><b>Have you ever been attacked by an animal?</b> <br>Yes, when I was a little girl my uncle lived down the road and had dogs that he&rsquo;d hunt raccoons with. I was six and his dog got out and attacked me and bit a big hole in my face and was trying to kill me. My grandma was an invalid and couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed so she was screaming for help. My uncle finally came and hit it with something but it tore me up pretty good. <br><br><b>Did you have to go to the hospital to get stitches?</b> <br>Back in the mountains you did your own stitching, your momma sewed you up. I guess he must have thought I was a racoon. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">London Sun</font><br><font size="2">December 13, 2007</font><br><b><br>&#39;My songs are like my children&#39;</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="London Sun" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="London Sun" width="455"></div><br><br>DOLLY PARTON may be small but she&rsquo;s so proud of the big assets that have carried her through life. <br><br>Of course, I&rsquo;m talking about her brilliant songwriting, her astute business sense and her iconic platinum blonde image. <br><br>Born one of twelve children to &ldquo;dirt poor&rdquo; parents, Dolly came down from the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee to seek her fame and fortune in the home of country music, Nashville. <br><br>Today, she owns a theme park, Dollywood, and a new label, Dolly Records. She&rsquo;s set up a children&rsquo;s reading programme called Imagination Library and she has just turned down the chance to judge American Idol because she doesn&rsquo;t want to be mean to wannabes. <br><br>But perhaps her greatest strength lies in her ability to poke fun at herself. It explains the title of her new album, Backwoods Barbie, due out early next year. <br><br>When I meet Dolly at London&rsquo;s Dorchester hotel, the 61-year-old is in dazzling, if self-deprecating form. Her wide smile could light up the darkest corner of the dingiest room. <br><br>She&rsquo;s here to talk about the album, to launch her tour of the UK next summer and to visit Rotherham to set up her first Imagination Library in England. <br><br>Here, she talks about her life in music and business. <br><br><b>The title of your forthcoming album, Backwoods Barbie, sums you up in such a brilliant way.</b><b><br></b> It&rsquo;s actually one of the songs from the Broadway musical, 9 To 5, that I&rsquo;ve written the music for. It&rsquo;s the little Doralee character that I play, but it&rsquo;s really my story. It says I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl, and I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world, like Barbie or the models in the Frederick&rsquo;s (of Hollywood) catalogue. Maybe I am just a Backwoods Barbie, too much make-up, too much hair, in a push-up bra and heels, but don&rsquo;t be fooled by thinking that the goods are not up there (<i>points to head</i>). It might look artificial but where it counts, I&rsquo;m real.<br> <b>You&rsquo;ve always written autobiographical themes in your songs.</b><b><br></b> I love story songs because I&rsquo;ve always loved books. When I was a kid, I was fascinated with stories and I started noticing that my songs really would take on just telling my whole story, like Coat Of Many Colours. <br><br><b>You sang about your mother sewing you that coat and how it gave you the luck. Do you think the song inspired your career?</b><b><br></b> Well, I know it didn&rsquo;t hurt. It has certainly been a big part of my career. That song has kind of followed me. Even though I might be known for I Will Always Love You, people have a sweeter feeling in their heart toward me about The Coat. People relate to that one more. <br><br><b>Was it because it came from your heart?</b><b><br></b> Yeah. I grew up hard but I think people appreciate that you love your parents and you love your family. I do and I&rsquo;ve been very blessed. So that&rsquo;s that little song but they&rsquo;re all special. I always say they&rsquo;re like my children and I expect them to support me when I&rsquo;m old, and some of them are. <br><br><b>Does Coat Of Many Colours mean the most to you?</b><b><br></b> I think it does. Sometimes when I sing it on stage, I actually cry. I know that when my mother was sick before she died, it would spin on what kind of shape she was in. When I thought about her, it would bring it all back and I would realise she wasn&rsquo;t gonna be around forever. I would think about how lucky I was to have good parents. Then after she died, it would nearly kill me to sing that song. I&rsquo;d have to talk about it a little bit (<i>to the audience</i>) in case I couldn&rsquo;t get through it. I would always get through it but sometimes I would just sit there with tears coming down. <br><br><b>You have a great attitude to life as your new song Better Get To Livin&rsquo; suggests.</b><b><br></b> Lord knows I&rsquo;ve been through enough stuff in my life and nobody&rsquo;s ever without feeling. I just try to have a good attitude. <br><br>I wake up every day hoping things are good and, if they&rsquo;re not, I try to set about making them better. One day Kent Wells, my guitar player, band leader and co-producer of the Backwoods Barbie album, said to me: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write a song about your attitude. Everyone comes up to me and up to you saying: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Dolly&rsquo;s secret?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good line.&rdquo; <br><br>So we wrote that song together. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m the Dalai Lama. I&rsquo;m just Dolly and I&rsquo;ll try to offer up advice but nobody has all the answers. <br><br><b>Tell me more about the album?</b><b><br></b> I wrote nine of the twelve songs. Some of them are real pure country, kinda like Coat Of Many Colours. The Barbie will remind you, in its melody and its emotion, of Coat. I did a couple of covers, She Drives Me Crazy by Fine Young Cannibals, with banjos and fiddles, and Smokey Robinson&rsquo;s Tracks of My Tears. <br><br><b>How come this is your first mainstream country album for a while?</b><b><br></b> When the new country came out ten to 15 years ago, people my age were almost too old. But it never stopped me. I never stopped writing. I never stopped recording.<br> I did bluegrass stuff which I was very proud of. With this new album, I have actually hired promotion people, radio people and I&rsquo;ve been going round to the stations just like the old days. <br><br><b>How are they reacting?</b><b><br></b> They&rsquo;re more excited to see me now. It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a big star in the house but I still don&rsquo;t know how seriously they&rsquo;re taking me and my music. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to help them play my music but they&rsquo;re glad that Dolly&rsquo;s there. &ldquo;Oh, can I get a picture for my daughter?&rdquo; <br><br><b>Do you think your image gets in the way of the music?</b><b><br></b> Well, it might have. I&rsquo;ve had people tell me that through the years, but you know what, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for all of it being exactly the way it is, the Backwoods Barbie syndrome, I would probably have had no one paying that much attention to me as a songwriter. I would never have even have got the chance to get my foot in the door if I hadn&rsquo;t been a freak to start with. <br><br><b>Did you get that look to sell yourself?</b><b><br></b> One of the lines in the Barbie thing says: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t judge me by the cover &rsquo;cos I&rsquo;m a real good book. Read into it what you will but see me as I am, the way I look is just a country girl&rsquo;s idea of glam.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like I just wanna be pretty and that fitted my style. <br><br>It came from a serious place. Then when I saw the attention, the more I enjoyed it and then the more people noticed me. I felt better looking like this than when I tried to dress down. The outside matched the outgoingness I felt on the inside. <br><br><b>How did you make that step in the first place, coming from this poor but loving family?</b><b><br></b> My mother&rsquo;s people were all musical so we were surrounded by music. Most of my people sang in church or local gatherings, or just on the front porch or back porch, but I was the one with the big personality. <br><br>I saw that this was something I could do for business. I started getting attention when I sang on the radio and TV, people were applauding a lot and I know now that much of it was because I was little. Then I thought it was &rsquo;cos they thought I was good. That gave me confidence and I thought I was like my daddy, he was a worker and I got my work ethic and business sense from him. <br><br>My mother&rsquo;s people were all great fun, creative, but they were lazy too. They would sleep all day, like typical musicians, but I would be up in the morning with my dad. I&rsquo;m still like him, up at three o&rsquo;clock. <br><br><b>You&rsquo;ve got so much going on in your life, you probably need to be up at that time.</b><b><br></b> Yeah, I do. I don&rsquo;t require a lot of sleep. I love the early morning so I can get a lot done. I saw early on that I could make a business out of this because I wanted money, I wanted to travel, I wanted clothes, I wanted to be loved, I wanted to be staying in fine hotels. <br><br>It wasn&rsquo;t to get away from what I was because I knew that would always be me. I&rsquo;ve never been ashamed of my people. I love my people and I love my home. You know I&rsquo;m still like a stupid hillbilly sometimes. <br><br><b>In the Wall Street Journal last year, you were down as one of the 50 women to watch.</b><b><br></b> I thought: &ldquo;Why do they call it the music business? Who&rsquo;s taking care of the business part of the music?&rdquo; <br><br>And I saw that if I was gonna be making this money or having these songs, I&rsquo;d better publish my own stuff. Just now, I&rsquo;ve got Dolly Records and, of course, I&rsquo;m making good money with Dollywood and other things. <br><br><b>I read you stopped Elvis from recording I Will Always Love You because you didn&rsquo;t want to give away your song.</b><b><br></b> That was one of the more heart-breaking things. It wasn&rsquo;t Elvis personally. He was excited he was gonna do the song. He loved the song and I loved the song but Colonel Tom (Parker, his manager) didn&rsquo;t tell me that Elvis had already worked the song up and I had told everybody he was doing it. <br><br>Then, on the last day of the session, Colonel Tom lays that one on me, that we take half the publishing rights if we record it. I said: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just tough&rdquo;, and, man, it was a heart-breaker. It was one of the hardest decisions I ever made but that was my song, it was already out, it was already published and I thought, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give this away. <br><br>I was gonna leave this to my brothers and sisters.&rdquo; Even though people said, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, but they had Elvis to do it, they could have made ten times more money than you could have had,&rdquo; something told me I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Then after Whitney (<i>Houston</i>), it was like, oh wow, I was certainly justified. <br><br><b>Do you think you were the one who really gave women a bit more power within that sort of country music framework?</b><b><br></b> Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn and myself were all in it about the same time. They got a little bit of a head start on me, certainly Loretta, but we were all three good friends and actually ended up doing an album together. <br><br>But I think I was a little different from them. Loretta had a house full of kids and she wrote those being brought down by men songs. Hers were more about home life and all the women who had children and I totally love and respect her. <br><br>Tammy could sing any number of things but she was also singing that Stand By Your Man. I was singing songs like Just Because I&rsquo;m A Woman . . . my mistakes are no worse than yours just because I&rsquo;m a woman. I think we all did our little thing. I just filled my spot. <br><br><b>Why do you think your songs from the wilds of Tennessee have become so universal?</b><b><br></b> That&rsquo;s because they have elements that everybody goes through. I know there&rsquo;s a lot of poor, cold people in London. We were very poor and my mother had to make me a coat and it&rsquo;s the same in England, Scotland or Ireland. How many rich people are there in this world? <br><br><b>What are your future ambitions?</b><b><br></b> I never want to retire first of all and I want to continue with my music. I still plan to tour. I want to make as good records as I can, writing as good songs as I can. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Nottingham Evening Post</font><br><font size="2">December 14, 2007</font><br><br><b>EG INTERVIEW: DOLLY PARTON</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Nottingham Evening Post" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Nottingham Evening Post" width="455"></div><br><br>Well-publicised physical discrepancies aside, Dolly Parton&#39;s a small woman. Which is not to say she&#39;s difficult to notice when she enters a room. <br><br>For she has, shall we say, a look that is somewhat individualistic. <br><br>Normally, it would perhaps be considered uncouth to mention how a woman of a certain age has hair colour that quite clearly comes out of a bottle, or makeup that&#39;s been applied with scant concern for subtlety. Normally, perhaps, but Dolly&#39;s made a pre-emptive strike against those jokes anyway, embracing them, along with the Tennessee mountain hillbilly stereotypes, and making them part of the humour and storytelling that&#39;s all part of the Dolly experience. She&#39;s a one-woman multi-million dollar entertainment empire who makes you feel like she could be topping up your coffee in a Waffle House off Interstate 40. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t have a lot of the big videos and the lights,&quot; she says of her live shows. &quot;People really don&#39;t care about the lighting, they want to hear me sing.&quot; <br><br>I mention that I&#39;ve lived in the part of Tennessee where she grew up and continues to make a home. She hails from Sevier County, while I used to live just over the county line in Cocke County, where the biggest town has historically had something of a reputation. <br><br>&quot;Oh sure, Newport,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;Folks used to go there for their illegal whiskey, their illegal women ...&quot; <br><br>This is a woman who&#39;s famously talked about going into town from her rural home as a girl, seeing the cheaply painted up town hooker, and reckoning that was the prettiest lady she&#39;d ever seen. This is the woman who, asked about dumb blonde jokes on a recent trip to South Yorkshire, responded that she knows she&#39;s not dumb, and we all know she&#39;s not blonde. Even the title of her new album and tour, Backwoods Barbie, shows a woman ready to be the first with a punchline about blondes or hicks. <br><br>It might do naysayers well to remember also that dumb folks, blonde or otherwise, do not tend to rise to the top of an empire that involves a theme park, a film career, a charitable organisation that gives books to children across North America, and of course a catalogue featuring more than 30 years of some of the most popular songs in country. <br><br>Oh yeah, and now she&#39;s working on a musical version of 9-to-5 for Broadway. <br><br>&quot;The Broadway stage is a little new to me,&quot; she admits, but a glance at her CV suggests she&#39;ll figure it out. <br><br>And this is a woman who, beneath the theme parks and films, the blonde jokes and breast jokes, is famous firstly because she&#39;s spent a career as one of country music&#39;s best singer-songwriters. <br><br>While she&#39;s happy to talk about the music, its the kids who really seem to get her going. There&#39;s a Dolly statue on the town square in the Sevier County seat, Sevierville, her &quot;greatest honour, because it came from the people who know me&quot;, and when you hear about the organisation that started there and spread all over North America and now to Britain, you start to understand why. <br><br>In addition to promoting this summer&#39;s tour, her recent trip to the UK coincided with the UK launch of her charity, Imagination Library. The programme, run through her Dollywood Foundation, gives free books to children in participating communities from the time they&#39;re infants until they reach primary school age. <br><br>&quot;If you can get a child&#39;s attention early on, it&#39;s important,&quot; she said. &quot;So they can learn how to read books, to love books.&quot; <br><br>If the subject sounds close to Dolly&#39;s heart, her upbringing offers an explanation. She grew up in rural poverty as one of a dozen children of a farmer who never learned to read. In the east Tennessee of Dolly&#39;s childhood, that wasn&#39;t a particularly uncommon story. <br><br>The Imagination Library started in Dolly&#39;s east Tennessee home and had spread to 43 states and Canada. The pilot UK programme is rolling out in Rotherham; Dolly and the people behind it believe it could be as big in the UK as it is in North America. In addition to her musical entourage, top Dollywood Foundation brass have been in Britain to get things off the ground. <br><br>&quot;If other communities want to do it, it&#39;s possible to do it,&quot; says David Dotson, executive director of the foundation. <br><br>In Nottingham this summer, fans will hear the Backwoods Barbie do all those big songs and tell all those downhome jokes. In Sevier County and around North America, little children who have never heard Jolene or 9-to-5 are also familiar with Dolly. <br><br>&quot;They call me the book lady,&quot; she said. &quot;My dad was prouder of me for this programme than for my music career. He thought it was grand that all the kids called me the book lady.&quot; <br><br>And there&#39;s nothing dumb about that. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Irish Independent</font><br><font size="2">December 16, 2007</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>&#39;I&#39;m just a country girl&#39;</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>&#39;I&#39;ve always been an odd bird,&#39; admits Dolly Parton, the multi-millionaire businesswoman who grew up dirt poor in the shadow of the Smoky Mountains to become the iconic queen of country.

My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known, no wonder, then, that I return the love.&quot; Dolly Parton had the same faithful mistress in the early Eighties. After she made The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas movie in 1982, she sank into a long and seemingly, at the time, bottomless depression. <br><br>&quot;I got overweight,&quot; she tells me over breakfast in London&#39;s Dorchester Hotel. <br><br>&quot;I was going through some hormonal changes, some female things, and I got really depressed for about 15, 18 months. During that dark spot, I could really see how people could commit suicide or get to drinking or do drugs. I never did any of that, but I tell you, I saw how you can go.&quot; <br><br>It is refreshing to hear that the most bubbly blonde on Earth suffers from the same dark nights of the soul as the rest of us. Still, it is hard to believe that the manifestly vivacious woman behind Jolene and I Will Always Love You gets down, not least when you see her on stage belting it out in all her spangly rhinestone regalia. <br><br>&quot;Sure, I get my moments,&quot; she says. &quot;I get my moments of depression. I&#39;m a human being. But I&#39;m not only a human being, I&#39;m a song-writer that writes very emotional songs. I can&#39;t close my feelings off. If I&#39;ve had a broken heart I can&#39;t not love again. I can&#39;t not feel again, because then I wouldn&#39;t be able to write the songs I want to. So I refuse. I have all kinds of feelings. I&#39;m not happy all the time. Nor would I want to be. Then I wouldn&#39;t know the difference.&quot; <br><br>When you hear her say something so real as this, you realise there is a lot more to Dolly Rebecca Parton than we had imagined. There is more to her than the gamey showbiz trouper who keeps the media at arm&#39;s length with well- practised lines such as, &quot;If I see something sagging, bagging and dragging, I&#39;m going to nip it, tuck it, and suck it,&quot; and &quot;Plastic surgeons make mountains out of molehills.&quot; Always delivered a la Dorothy Parker or Mae West, of course. <br><br>Up close, Parton is witty and camp, but there is another side to her too. She talks about the God core, the God self, that she believes is within us all. &quot;And I try to connect to that,&quot; she says. &quot;I study the other religions of the world. I love knowing what other people think. But when the day is over, I have my own connection with God,&quot; she says, passionately. <br><br>&quot;Because who knows what we&#39;re here with? Who knows who we are? Who knows if we are going anywhere else?&quot; She then outlines her ruling philosophy. Try to find the best in every day. Try to make the most of who you are. Try to make the most of the stuff you&#39;ve got inside you. <br><br>&quot;You can wallow around in your sorrow all day long if that&#39;s what you choose to do but you better get to living and finding out. Don&#39;t wallow in it.&quot; I say that sadness can be like quicksand, the more you move about in it, the further you go down. <br><br>&quot;Yes! Get out of that. Get up and get out. I know it hurts, but, you know, get on with it, get on with life.&quot; <br><br>She says that she hopes when we get to heaven that we can all be happy all the time, &quot;but not right now&quot;. <br><br>I play devil&#39;s advocate and ask her how she can be sure there will even be a heaven. &quot;It is just the way I was brought up,&quot; she says, referring to her Pentecostal rearing in the shadow of Tennessee&#39;s Smoky Mountains. &quot;I choose to believe it. Even if there wasn&#39;t a heaven, I choose to believe. I want to believe there&#39;s a God. I want to believe there&#39;s something greater than us.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;ll be 62 next month. Parton says that the older she has become, the more she has thought about death. &quot;When you get older, you think about it, mostly because you want to be prepared,&quot; she smiles. <br><br>So says the woman whom Dolly the sheep, the world&#39;s first cloned mammal, was named after. She says she inherited her philosophy of life from her parents but also from the poor people she grew up around in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. &quot;In the mountains,&quot; she says, &quot;one of the ways you survive when you are as poor as we were is to have a sense of humour. You have to laugh about your own conditions and find all the humour in it, or you would go mad. You&#39;d go crazy or be depressed.&quot; <br><br>It was not always easy to get on in Locust Ridge, however, where Dolly&#39;s dress sense, fastidiously modelled on the local town whore, made her life troublesome. &quot;I never gave up. I used to get whippings because I would wear my short skirts, my red finger nails, my bright lipstick and my high heels. I just couldn&#39;t help it. It was just who I wanted to be.&quot; <br><br>Can you help it any more now? <br><br>&quot;No, I am who I am,&quot; she says with suitable Southern belle sass. <br><br>Her grandfather, Jake Owens, was a preacher who believed Dolly was Jezebel reborn, and, as such, nothing less than the fires of hell awaited her. In time, she says he saw that she was doing great work, and people were accepting her, not thinking she was as trashy as she looked. Seeing the goodness that was in her, he came around before he passed away. &quot;He was very proud of me in the end.&quot; <br><br>Wasn&#39;t Bible Belt Southern religion and your sexuality a particularly explosive mix for you? <br><br>&quot;It has always been for me, my spirituality and my sexuality, but I have always been comfortable with myself. I have always felt fine. I grew up Pentecostal. That&#39;s hellfire and brimstone. Women in the early days of the church were not even allowed to pluck their eyebrows or shave their legs. So you could well imagine what kind of a freak I was considered.&quot; <br><br>Throughout our time together, Dolly Parton never once stops smiling or holding eye contact. She is so petite she almost looks cartoonish or artificial, a rhinestone Barbie come to life on the squishy sofa at the Dorchester. This doesn&#39;t displease either. &quot;People think that I am as artificial as I look. I&#39;m not. I have a new album called Backwards Barbie and that&#39;s what it is about. It has lines like: &#39;I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.&#39; I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world, like Barbie and the models in the Frederick&#39;s catalogue. In my dreams, I could have it all. I have often been misunderstood because of how I look. But don&#39;t judge me by the cover because I&#39;m a real good book. Read into me what you will but see me as I am.&quot; <br><br>And what are you, Dolly Parton? <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just a country girl&#39;s idea of glam,&quot; she says. &quot;So people sometimes look at me and maybe think that I&#39;m completely tacky and artificial. But I love tacky. And if there is any magic about me through the years it is that I look totally artificial but I am totally real. I have always been more flamboyant from the inside than I was on the outside. I am just plain. I&#39;m not a natural beauty. Little things that have always been negatives to me, I have made into positives. I just look at it like that and just go with it.&quot; <br><br>Nigella Lawson texts me to ask who her favourite writer is (&quot;I&#39;m so crazy for her!&quot;). When I text back that Dolly adores Appalachian author Lee Smith, the domestic goddess harrumphs. &quot;Pity. I wanted her to read Dostoevsky.&quot; <br><br>If she was lying on the couch opposite Sigmund Freud, what would she want to ask him? <br><br>&quot;&#39;What were you smoking when you came up with all that shit? What were you sniffing? What were you shooting in your veins when you had some of those thoughts?&#39;&quot; <br><br>Despite singing the feminist anthem Nine To Five, Dolly doesn&#39;t, surprisingly, consider herself a feminist. &quot;No, I&#39;m not. I just think I&#39;m a woman who loves life and loves people for what they are. I love my work. I have always been a freak myself, an odd bird, and I figure if people will let me be me and allow me to be who I am then I can certainly accept them and not be judgemental.&quot; <br><br>Would her mother make her wash her mouth out with soap for using words like &quot;freak&quot; about herself? <br><br>&quot;Yes, she would. Maybe freak is not the perfect word. I was an odd wad, certainly back where I grew up. I was so different then, wearing all the make-up and the hair and short skirts in a very religious family. They thought I was going to hell.&quot; <br><br>How does the multi-millionaire businesswoman stay connected to the dirt-poor girl who grew up in rural America? &quot;I never lost her,&quot; she says. &quot;I think a lot of it has to do with the songs I write. I always write about home. I think about home and I always remember those things from my childhood. So when I sing The Coat Of Many Colours and Tennessee Mountain Home it just keeps you anchored. Plus, it&#39;s a crazy world, no doubt about that, but I try to keep my own personal world as sane as I possibly can. I do normal things. I read when I&#39;m home. I do cooking.&quot; <br><br>Her culinary speciality is the food her mother always cooked for her: fried chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Needless to say she doesn&#39;t eat fried chicken or mashed potatoes the way she used to growing up. &quot;I do eat it, but not large amounts. I eat small portions because I am very short and I have a very big appetite. So if I eat the way I&#39;d like to, I&#39;d be big as a house, and I have been!&quot; she laughs. <br><br>She and her husband, Carl Dean, have been married 41 years &quot;and we do very ordinary things&quot;. <br><br>How do they keep the relationship going? A show-business marriage lasting that long is a miracle. <br><br>&quot;Well, it really is. But one thing, my husband is not in the business as well. Sometimes I think a lot of marriages don&#39;t work if both people are in show business because they have a conflict of interest. But my husband and I have a lot of things in common but a lot of things we don&#39;t have in common. And I think the lot of things we don&#39;t have in common makes it interesting because he enjoys hearing about things and I enjoy telling it. We&#39;re just very compatible. He&#39;s got a good heart. He&#39;s got a good sense of humour.&quot; <br><br>He would want to have a good sense of humour, given some of the articles that have been written about his marriage to Dolly Parton, some of which have alleged that it is an open relationship. &quot;I&#39;m always seeing things in the paper,&quot; she laughs, &quot;and taking it home and saying: &#39;Here, you might want to read this! We&#39;re divorcing, you know!&#39;&quot; <br><br>When I met Dolly before, in 2002, I read to her what her biographer, Alanna Nash, wrote: &quot;Dolly certainly acts and talks at times as though her marriage is an open one. She is a love junkie and needs constant comforting and approval.&quot; <br><br>&quot;A crock of shit,&quot; she laughed then. &quot;That is just another person&#39;s opinion of me. I love my husband; there is not a man that has been born that could take me away from my husband. I always say, &#39;Yes, I am married, but I am not dead and I am not blind&#39;. It&#39;s not true that me and my husband sleep with other people any time we want to.&quot; <br><br>There were also tabloid allegations that the salty queen of country music had an affair with a 15-year-old boy when she was 25 and married, to say nothing of flings with Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Sylvester Stallone. Has she ever sued over the open marriage allegations? <br><br>&quot;No. But you know what, sometimes you think about that and by time that you go through all the process of suing somebody they&#39;ll be writing a new story the next week. It is not worth the trouble. So I just look at it and get my best comedy from the stuff they write about me. I look at it and think, &#39;How funny is that?&#39;&quot; <br><br>Ah, yes, time for a quick-fire round of funny questions before Parton has to depart. How do you stay upright with your proportions? <br><br>&quot;I am used to it. With my high-heel shoes and my big boobs, sometimes when I&#39;m walking down the stairs I have to be very careful because I could really topple over.&quot; <br><br>Do you ever get nervous on planes that your breast implants could explode? <br><br>&quot;No, I don&#39;t get nervous on boats, either, because I know I have my own flotation devices, and my own airbags if I have an accident in a car.&quot; <br><br>The iconic queen of country music looks closer to 50 than 61, with a waist you could put your hand around, and says defiantly that the plastic surgery hasn&#39;t stopped for her. &quot;No, I will do whatever I need to do,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m one of those kind of people.&quot; <br><br>What if something went wrong? <br><br>&quot;Well, anything can go wrong.&quot; The woman who has garnered as many headlines for her plastic surgery as the Bride of Wildenstein hoots with laughter. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t say I&#39;m not frightened when I do it. Anything can happen in life. You could pull a knife out now and stab me in the heart. So anybody can die anyway. I do what I need to do. That&#39;s how I live my life.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">New York Times</font><br><font size="2">January 26, 2003</font><br><br><b>St. Dolly and Her Flock</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="New York Times" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="New York Times" width="455"></div><br><br>Visitors to Chasing Rainbows, the museum devoted to Dolly Parton&#39;s life history at Dollywood, Ms. Parton&#39;s theme park here in her hometown, are greeted at the door by Thomasina Bicer, 52. &quot;Hi there! Would you like a rainbow?&quot; She pats a rainbow sticker on the visitor&#39;s lapel and smiles: &quot;Now you can chase your dreams, just like Dolly.&quot;<br><br>Dollywood means the world to Ms. Bicer. Nine years ago, when she first visited the park on a vacation from her home in Williamstown, N.J., she found a &quot;peace haven&quot; that changed her life, she said. &quot;I was on five different medications for high blood pressure and depression, and after I got back from here and listened to her records I went off them completely,&quot; she said. &quot;Doctors asked me what happened, and I said, &#39;Dolly did that to me.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Ms. Bicer visited the park six or seven times a year for the next seven years, then moved to east Tennessee two years ago and began working at the park. &quot;After I moved here I wrote her a thank you note,&quot; she said. &quot;I said that she was an angel to me. I told her I feel that she saved my life. If it wasn&#39;t for her making a peaceful, loving, godly place to calm me, I would have gotten sicker.&quot; She mailed the letter but received no response. &quot;It&#39;s O.K.,&quot; Ms. Ricer said without resentment. &quot;She&#39;s a very busy person.&quot; <br><br>Ms. Ricer&#39;s experience is striking but not unique. Many people who love Dolly Parton believe they have a special relationship with the star, and not without reason. Her fame is based on a paradox that encourages that conviction. Ms. Parton&#39;s physical appearance is as spectacularly artificial as her emotional presence is accessibly authentic. Though her flash and dazzle evoke the kind of awe usually reserved for Stars From Outer Space (Cher, Michael Jackson), her manner evokes the warmth and fellow-feeling reserved for Stars Like Us (Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks). <br><br>Dollywood itself sprang from another paradox of Ms. Parton&#39;s character. In her autobiography, &quot;My Life and Other Unfinished Business&quot; (HarperCollins, 1994), she describes Dollywood as an expression of wild ambition: the first time Ms. Parton visited Los Angeles, she looked up at the Hollywood sign and thought, &quot;I would like to change that &#39;H&#39; into a &#39;D.&#39;&quot; At the same time, she describes it as an offering of pure-hearted altruism: &quot;The theme park is much more about the mountains and the culture of the people who live there than it is about Dolly Parton....I saw Dollywood as a chance to honor them.&quot; <br><br>The product of these paradoxes, as observed during a recent visit to Dollywood, is an almost vertiginous brand of intimacy. The singer&#39;s fans, residents of Pigeon Forge and Dollywood employees say they believe that Ms. Parton cares for them personally. And yet they say they are so secure in her affections that, if she&#39;s too busy chasing rainbows to reciprocate in conventional ways, that&#39;s just fine. <br><br>Lori E. Seid, 43, an Emmy award-winning producer of &quot;The Rosie O&#39;Donnell Show&quot; is producing a documentary about Dolly Parton fans called &quot;For the Love of Dolly.&quot; &quot;People couldn&#39;t be happier for Dolly, for the growth of her celebrity and her success, as long as she seems to remember them personally, and where she came from, which, impressively, she does quite well,&quot; Ms. Seid said. <br><br>The documentary&#39;s director, Tai Uhlman, 30, has interviewed dozens of fans around the world, ranging from the artist Larry Krone, whose installation inspired by the song &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; was exhibited at the Whitney at Phillip Morris in Manhattan last year, to Jeanette Williams, a Los Angeles woman who has Ms. Parton&#39;s signature tattooed on her body in three places.<br> For her most passionate fans, Ms. Uhlman said, &quot;Dolly is an occasion to express love and compassion and joy and honesty.&quot; <br><br>&quot;They can experience these things with a lot of freedom, &quot; she said, &quot;because they&#39;re focused on a kind of imaginary, mythic person. The way they talk about her, she could be Our Lady of Guadalupe.&quot; <br><br>In a recent telephone interview, Ms. Parton, 57, invoked a less exalted maternal image to describe Dollywood&#39;s significance to her fans. &quot;It gave them somewhere to go, that they didn&#39;t have to hang on to me so much,&quot; she said. &quot;Almost like a mama. I can&#39;t entertain &#39;em all the time. I can send &#39;em to the playground, though, with fun people that I trust. You know: &#39;Go. Go, go, go play. Go swing. Go get on the seesaw.&#39; &#39;Cause they feel like it&#39;s all me. It&#39;s under that Dolly umbrella. And I feel good that I&#39;ve been able to give them something. An extension of myself, so to speak.&quot; <br><br>In 1997, Ms. Parton disbanded her fan club and asked its former members to send their money to her favorite charities instead. Patric Parkey, 45, and Harrell Gabeheart, 43, of Irving, Tex., took seriously her call to give. Each year they attend charity auctions endorsed by Ms. Parton, where they bid on memorabilia to add to the collection that fills their 1,400 square-foot home, &quot;every room, floor to ceiling, wall to wall,&quot; Mr. Parkey said. Among their greatest treasures: one of Ms. Parton&#39;s license plates, one of her wigs and a Dolly Parton pinball machine. The men are considering moving their bedroom into the garage to make room for more. <br><br>Having photos of the star all over their house, Mr. Gabeheart said, &quot;brings out the best in both of us.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s kind of hard to look at her all the time and not get closer to one another, because she teaches about family values and being supportive of one another,&quot; he added.<br> One weekend in December, when Ms. Parton gave three concerts at Dollywood to raise money for her nonprofit Imagination Library, which gives books to young children, Mr. Parkey and Mr. Gabeheart realized a long-held dream. They had a private visit with Ms. Parton. The meeting, which they won at a benefit auction for the Boys and Girls Club in Sevierville, Tenn., was scheduled to last five minutes but ran to about 20. They said Ms. Parton had chatted on their cell phone with their hairdresser, signed one of the porcelain dolls they make in her image and looked at photographs from their collection. &quot;She told us, &#39;All you need is my panties and drawers,&#39;&quot; Mr. Gabeheart said. &quot;But we don&#39;t want that. That&#39;s too personal.&quot; <br><br>Mr. Parkey said he wanted Ms. Parton to know that &quot;we&#39;re fans, but we&#39;re not hysterical fans.&quot; He added, &quot;I didn&#39;t want her to think, &#39;Oh, God, there&#39;s two more crazies.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Mr. Gabeheart looks forward to seeing her again: &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have a problem meeting her in the future. Because the people that are around her know who we are now.&quot; <br><br>Another fan who&#39;s known by Ms. Parton and her people is David Schmidli, 33, of Huntsville, Ala. For Mr. Schmidli, who has cerebral palsy, Ms. Parton is quite literally the alpha and omega: his mother, Jo Ann, 72, teaches him to spell by using words drawn from Ms. Parton&#39;s song titles and lyrics. Each day he awakens at 3:30 a.m. to scour the Web for news of Ms. Parton, then feeds his German Shepherd, named Sparkles Dolly Parton, before going to his job as a tester at a computer manufacturing facility. During the holidays, he invites his co-workers home to show them his Christmas tree covered with 400 homemade ornaments, each decorated with Ms. Parton&#39;s picture. <br><br>Mr. Schmidli also sharpens his dexterity by making needlepoint tissue box covers and fly swatter covers bearing Ms. Parton&#39;s image (with angel wings). When he presents these items to her each April at the park&#39;s opening day, Mrs. Schmidli says, &quot;She&#39;s as kind and as good as she can be.&quot; <br><br>&quot;She looks down from on high on her float,&quot; Mrs. Schmidli said, &quot;and she says, &#39;I love you, too, David.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Ms. Parton&#39;s status as an emblem of possibility is magnified in her hometown. &quot;She&#39;s as big as a star can get,&quot; explained Judge Gary R. Wade, 54, of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. He was two years behind Ms. Parton at Sevier County High School. &quot;If there&#39;s a kid who has any talent at all here in town,&quot; he continued, &quot;you can point to Dolly Parton and say, &#39;She came from here, and that means anything can happen, to anyone who works for it.&quot; <br><br>Dave Anderson, 44, special events director at Dollywood, said that Ms. Parton&#39;s fame had a similar effect on employees of the theme park. &quot;It&#39;s exciting to say you work for Dollywood, for Dolly Parton,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve never worked for anybody that&#39;s been on &#39;Letterman&#39; to talk about me, even indirectly.&quot; <br><br>Most Dollywood employees have little personal contact with Ms. Parton. She makes public appearances at the park twice a year and attends private business meetings there about four times a year. But in December, for the first time since 1998, Ms. Parton posed for photographs with groups of employees. <br><br>On a rainy Friday morning, about a thousand Dollywood staffers gathered in the park&#39;s Showstreet Palace theater. When Ms. Parton bounded to center stage in five-inch heels, they erupted in cheers and applause. &quot;What in the world you doin&#39; out in the rain this time of mornin&#39;?&quot; she teased. &quot;I know! You come out cause you&#39;re crazy.&quot; She tossed her head and laughed, pulling strands of her wig from her mouth. &quot;And I got my hair caught in my lip gloss! Just know that I love you and I appreciate you,&quot; she said. <br><br>She stood aside as a Dollywood employee told the crowd, &quot;You know the drill: no coats, no cameras, no bags, nothin&#39; to be autographed.&quot; For the next hour, Ms. Parton walked back and forth between bleachers on either side of the stage, posing with groups of 10 to 30 employees at a time. When the last picture had been taken, she hollered a down-home &quot;Thank you!&quot; and turned on her heel with queenly efficiency; an assistant covered her shoulders with a woolen cape that billowed as she strode offstage. <br><br>For Ms. Parton&#39;s admirers, the paradoxes of her persona, artificial and authentic, ambitious and altruistic, distant and down-to-earth, hang together. And with her, they experience a kind of intimacy that is all the more powerful for being composed largely of illusion. <br><br>&quot;A lot of times my fans don&#39;t come to see me be me,&quot; she said. &quot;They come to see me be them. They come to hear me say what they want to hear, what they&#39;d like to say themselves, or to say about them what they want to believe is true.&quot; <br><br>Ms. Parton evaluated these illusions in terms that were by turns critical, empathic and pragmatic: &quot;I&#39;ve often wondered if it&#39;s healthy for some of these people to depend on me that much, to where people live through you and don&#39;t live their own lives. It&#39;s like when people say, &#39;I&#39;m in love,&#39; when they&#39;re really in lust. They call so many things love. I spend a lot of time thinking about stuff like that in the wee hours. But I think it&#39;s healthier for those people to have something to look forward to than to not. If they&#39;ve got a show to look forward to or a record to look forward to, it might keep them from doing something bad to themselves or to somebody else. Or give &#39;em something more to do than just dwelling on themselves so much. I don&#39;t know. I just know I love the fans. I appreciate &#39;em. I love what I do. So I guess we&#39;ll all be at it for a long time to come.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Reading Today</font><br><font size="2">February/March 2003</font><br><br><b>A chat with &quot;the Book Lady&quot;</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Reading Today" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Reading Today" width="455"></div><br><br>After the press event in December, Dolly Parton gave exclusive one-on-one interviews to a few select media outlets, including <i>Reading Today</i>. Here&#39;s what Parton had to say about books, teachers, and reading. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve just always loved books,&quot; Parton said. &quot;If you can read, you can do anything. You can educate yourself if you can read. I prefer books over TV and movies. I love the way they look, the way they feel, the way they smell. I love everything about them.&quot;<br> Parton recalled her own upbringing in a poor family where books were scarce. Her father, who died a couple of years ago, was a smart man, a good provider, and a wonderful father, she said, but he never learned to read. He took pride in the fact that she finished school and chose reading as the cause she promoted. <br><br>Parton says she got involved in the Imagination Library &quot;from a deep place in my heart.&quot; It&#39;s so important that children learn to love books at an early age, she added. <br><br>The Imagination Library, Parton Said, encourages children to learn to read so they can do more and can reach their dreams. <i>The Little Engine That Could</i>, the program&#39;s signature book, is about teaching children to have faith in themselves, just as she always had, even when times were hard. &quot;I&#39;m the Little Engine That Did,&quot; she added, smiling. <br><br>Parton herself has contributed to the field of children&#39;s literature with her picture book <i>Coat of Many Colors</i>, based on her hit song of the same title. The story tells about a coat she owned as a child that her mother stitched together out of many different pieces of cloth. Although the other children at school made fun of her, Parton took pride in her coat and the love that her mother had sewed into it. <br><br>&quot;When we first started, we thought [the Imagination Library] would really help children at a very young age,&quot; Parton said. However, the program has grown even beyond her expectations. The Imagination Library now operates in more than 180 communities in 25 states, and the new governor of Tennessee wants to extend the program to all children throughout the state. <br><br>Parton recalled that she wasn&#39;t much of a student in school. She was always daydreaming about a music career in Nashville. But she stuck it out and remains glad she did. She credits one particular teacher, Archie McMahan, as having had a great influence on her. &quot;I loved her, and I learned everything she taught,&quot; Parton said. &quot;She gave me a love of books.&quot; <br><br>Parton has great respect for teachers in general, and she hopes her Imagination Library project helps more children enter school prepared for reading and eager to learn. &quot;Personally, I think teachers are the most underpaid and underrated people there are,&quot; Parton said. &quot;In some ways, they have as much influence on children as parents. Sometimes they have even more. Thanks for all you do for our children.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Associated Press</font><br><font size="2">June 19, 2003</font><br><br><b>Parton Never Without Her Wig or Makeup</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Associated Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Associated Press" width="455"></div><br><br>ORLANDO, Fla. - Few stars revel in the superficiality of celebrity glamour and then pop its pretensions the way Dolly Parton does.<br><br>Parton was all dolled up like an American flag to publicize her Dixie Stampede theater in Orlando, which opened to the public Thursday. <br><br>Her high heels matched her red and gold hoop earrings. The sleeves of her tight, white-leather dress were blue, covered with white stars, and the front of the dress was striped in red and white. Her lips were smeared with ruby red lipstick, her eyes lined heavily. Her golden locks were feathered. <br><br>A horse from her Dixie Stampede show trotted up to her Wednesday as she sat next to Al Roker in folding chairs, talking up the attraction. <br><br>&quot;Give me a kiss,&quot; she puckered up to the horse on national television. But when the horse got too friendly and nipped at her hair, she giggled in mock alarm, &quot;Don&#39;t pull my wig off.&quot; <br><br>Although Parton is known for saying, &quot;It costs a lot of money to look this cheap,&quot; there is one unbreakable rule behind her nudge-nudge, wink-wink attitude of &quot;I&#39;m famous and I know this is all fake.&quot; With the exception of her husband, Carl Dean, hardly anyone gets to see what&#39;s behind all the cosmetic artifice of one of the most down-to-earth celebrities. <br><br>&quot;Part of the magic is that I look so totally artificial but I am so totally real,&quot; Parton, 57, said in an interview. <br><br>She would never step outside the house without the wig and makeup, she joked, &quot;unless my husband is dying of a heart attack, and even then I would think about it.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s important because I don&#39;t want someone to see me and be disappointed,&quot; she said. Then she cracked, &quot;What they&#39;re seeing reflects the phony that I am.&quot; <br><br>Even Ted Miller, her business manager for years, has never seen Parton without a wig and makeup. <br><br>&quot;Nor will I ever,&quot; Miller said. &quot;Dolly is Dolly. She never steps out unless she&#39;s complete.&quot; <br><br>He added, &quot;She may sleep in it. I assume Carl Dean has seen her not in full-regalia.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s outlandish look, blonde tresses, short skirts, sequins, high heels, heavy makeup, was born of a country girl&#39;s idea of glamour and has survived four decades in show business. She started wearing the wigs years ago because her fine hair wouldn&#39;t do what she wanted it to do when it was teased and dyed. <br><br>&quot;But then it got to be fun for me, a conversational piece,&quot; she said. &quot;But this is how I think a look the best. I&#39;m not a natural beauty and this is just the look I chose.&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s a look that requires high maintenance, although she claims she can get into her get-up in less than a half hour if necessary. Her childhood friend and personal assistant, Judy Ogle, whom Parton calls &quot;Sissy,&quot; constantly is by her side, ready to swipe away a misplaced hair or add more makeup. <br><br>It&#39;s a look that makes her look 15 years younger than her actual age. It&#39;s also a look that belies the fact that she is one of music&#39;s most talented and prolific songwriters, author of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; and an astute businesswoman worth hundreds of millions of dollars. <br><br>In fact, it&#39;s business that brings her to Orlando on a cloudy summer day. The $28 million Orlando theater of her Dixie Stampede is the fourth location for the dinner show, which is a cross between a wholesome Las Vegas revue and a rodeo.<br> Parton also owns a publishing company, two television and movie production companies and Dollywood, a theme park based in eastern Tennessee. She is releasing a new album, &quot;For God and Country,&quot; in September and an album of her songs recorded by other female singers will be released the following month. <br><br>She also is planning to play movie star Mae West in a television movie. The role will give Parton a chance to try out some new wigs. At any given time, she has about a dozen handy. <br><br>During a news conference for the opening of the Dixie Stampede in Orlando, Parton acknowledged that her look may come off as cartoonish to some, but she said she hopes people see past the surface. <br><br>&quot;I hope people see the brain underneath the wig and the heart beneath the boobs,&quot; Parton said.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Knoxville News-Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">June 21, 2003</font><br><br><b>Parton kicks off Dollywood&#39;s KidsFest</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE - When Dolly Parton stepped onto the stage, the crowd exploded.<br><br>&quot;Hello!&quot; she said. &quot;Welcome, everybody, to the opening of &#39;KidsFest!&#39;&quot; <br><br>The Sevier County gal was at her namesake theme park, Dollywood, Friday to promote the opening of a new festival, &quot;KidsFest,&quot; that is billed as the largest children&#39;s festival in the South. <br><br>Parton said starting KidsFest was a perfect idea because of the work she already does with Imagination Library, a program that encourages children to read. <br><br>She said she loves children and KidsFest will be a way to help her show that love. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;re the unofficial babysitters,&quot; she joked. <br><br>KidsFest kicked off Friday with Parton singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Garfield as he turned 25. Also present at the show were Larry and Bob from &quot;Veggie Tales,&quot; a member of the team from the Purina Dog Chow Incredible Dog Team and members of the ASA Extreme Sports Show. <br><br>Each of those attending will do shows over the summer for KidsFest. <br><br>Parton said she hopes to expand in the future and have a children&#39;s show at Dollywood all-year long. She said the working title would be &quot;At Granny&#39;s Farm.&quot; <br><br>&quot;We need a new Mr. Rogers,&quot; Parton said. &quot;And, hopefully, I&#39;ll be it. They can call me Aunt Granny, and Carl (her husband) Uncle Poo-paw.&quot; <br><br>KidsFest will be at Dollywood through August 10. This is the first year for the festival, and the plan is for it to be a continuing feature. <br><br>In addition to KidsFest, Parton also has opened a new Dixie Stampede in Orlando, Fla., that is the largest of four Dixie Stampedes. The other three are in Pigeon Forge, Myrtle Beach, S.C. and Branson, Mo. <br><br>Besides featuring Union and Confederate troops performing on horseback, the new Dixie Stampede will have buffalo. <br><br>&quot;We thought it was the American thing to do,&quot; Parton said. <br><br>She said she&#39;ll be staying busy over the next few months, with a show scheduled for July 4 in Washington D.C. She will appear at the annual Concert at the Mall along with other artists. <br><br>She said she is also working in the recording studio on a patriotic gospel album titled &quot;Red, White and Bluegrass.&quot; It will cover some traditional patriotic songs, along with the title track that she wrote herself. <br><br>Parton said she is shooting for the album to come out on Sept. 11, and she will begin her &quot;God and Country&quot; concert tour immediately afterward. <br><br>Parton is also in awe of a new tribute album of her songs that will be released in October. <br><br>Artists on the album will include Shania Twain, Melissa Etheridge, Sinead O&#39;Connor and Norah Jones. <br><br>&quot;A lot of these girls have been fans of mine and say they were inspired by me,&quot; Parton said, laughing. <br><br>But the expression on her face as she ticked off the names of the artists on the album was a giveaway that the admiration is mutual. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Mountain Press</font><br><font size="2">June 24, 2003</font><br><br><b>Quality time with Dolly Parton - Dolly talks about future, family<br></b><br><img align="bottom" alt="Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mountain Press" width="455"></div><br><br>If Dolly Parton could be any vegetable in the world, she would be a tomato, albeit a rotten tomato. <br><br>That was what Parton said at the Friday kick-off of KidsFest, which introduced Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber from VeggieTales, Garfield, the Purina Dog Chow Incredible Dog Team and the Extreme Sports Show. <br><br>Although she said she liked all the vegetables and didn&#39;t want to single any out, Parton thrilled the crowd of children and parents when she commented that she probably resembled a tomato more than any other vegetable. <br><br>&quot;I think KidsFest is a great event and anytime we can do something to entertain and inspire kids, like with our Imagination Library, it is wonderful,&quot; said Parton. <br><br>This past year, the Imagination Library, has reached 33 states and over 200 communities. <br><br>&quot;We gave out over 500,000 books last year and we will probably give out over a million this year,&quot; said Parton. <br><br>As for new projects, she will be putting out a patriotic album some time in September called, &quot;For God and Country&quot;. <br><br>&quot;I will be touring for the album once it comes out but probably only in America since I don&#39;t think any other country would be too interested,&quot; Parton said. <br><br>Parton&#39;s music special that was filmed at Dollywood during the Christmas season will also premiere in September on Country Music Television. <br><br>&quot;I have been keeping busy and I don&#39;t think I ever have time off,&quot; said Parton when asked about her summer plans. <br><br>When she does get the occasional weekend break, Parton said she likes to spend it camping with her husband or cooking &quot;like my mama used to cook. My favorite thing to make is chicken and dumplings but I like to cook any good southern food.&quot; <br><br>For the past several weeks, Parton has been making trips from Nashville to Sevier County to visit her mother, Avie Lee, who is 81.<br> &quot;My mother had a mild stroke and although she is at home now, she is still fragile and is having some trouble swallowing,&quot; said Parton, quietly. &quot;She is doing pretty good though.&quot; <br><br>Something that has cheered Parton up during recent weeks is a tribute album that will debut in October with several female performers covering her hit songs. <br><br>&quot;Shania Twain will be performing &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; and Melissa Etheridge will cover &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, said Parton, who also mentioned Norah Jones and Sinead O&#39;Connor as album contributors. <br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t even know people were working on an album until they asked me to sing the title track, but I think it is just great,&quot; Parton said. <br><br>For a self-proclaimed rotten tomato, Parton continues to give selflessly to the people of Sevier County and beyond.  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Orlando Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">June 26, 2003</font><br><b><br>Dolly Parton enjoys a musical comeback, expands business empire</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Orlando Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Orlando Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>ORLANDO, Fla. &mdash; One of Dolly Parton&#39;s early hits, way back in 1967, was called &quot;Dumb Blonde.&quot; <br><br>Like much of her image, the title was a comical exaggeration for effect. <br><br>So it makes sense that Parton, 57, likes Mae West, the bawdy actress whom she is considering playing in an upcoming TV movie.<br>&quot;I really relate to her,&quot; Parton says in a quick interview in an upstairs conference room at her new Dixie Stampede dinner theater in Orlando, Fla. A form-fitting fire-engine-red dress emphasizes the singer&#39;s hourglass figure. <br><br>&quot;We have very similar attitudes toward life and business. It turns out she wrote a lot of her own material and so do I. She also had a healthy attitude about sex and men, and so do I.&quot; <br><br>Parton lets go with the girlish laugh that often punctuates her sentences. She has spent the day delivering songs and one-liners, first to visiting weatherman Al Roker on NBC&#39;s &quot;Today Show,&quot; then to a hall full of journalists, tour operators and hoteliers. <br><br>Earlier, Parton told reporters in the attraction&#39;s Carriage Room that she&#39;s not &quot;skeered&quot; of competition from Mickey Mouse. A guy in the balcony hollered: &quot;Dolly, you&#39;re the diva!&quot; <br><br>Parton didn&#39;t miss a beat: &quot;I told you to wait in the truck!&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s corn-pone humor, but it&#39;s not dumb. As Parton herself is fond of saying, &quot;It costs a lot to look this cheap!&quot; <br><br>Lost behind the image is the fact that Parton, in town to open the $28 million attraction, has executed a musical comeback that might be envied by other veteran country stars. <br><br>While pioneers such as George Jones languished in the obscurity of the county-fair concert circuit, Parton astutely remade her musical career with &quot;The Grass Is Blue&quot; (1999), &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; (2001) and &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; (2002), a trio of critically acclaimed bluegrass albums. <br><br>&quot;The Grass Is Blue&quot; garnered a Grammy Award for best bluegrass recording, and &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; arrived in time to capitalize on the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; phenomenon. &quot;Sparrow&quot; earned Parton a Grammy for best female country vocal performance for her interpretation of Collective Soul&#39;s rock hit &quot;Shine.&quot; <br><br>While others embraced bluegrass as an intellectual curiosity, Parton, now a tremendously wealthy woman, delivers her music with the purity of a singer raised in poverty as one of 12 children in rural Locust Ridge, Tenn.<br> &quot;She has a great sense of the music from way back,&quot; says David Dees, host of a long-running Sunday-night bluegrass show on the University of Central Florida&#39;s WUCF-FM. &quot;She has a genuine familiarity with the bluegrass sensibility. Other country musicians have done bluegrass albums, but she wasn&#39;t following a fad. She was in the vanguard of that change.&quot; <br><br>In the studio, Parton has enhanced her innate knowledge with an esteemed cast of celebrated bluegrass stars, including fiddler Stuart Duncan, banjoist Jim Mills and guitarist Bryan Sutton, the latter two known for work with Ricky Skaggs. <br><br>She also brings a delicate songwriting touch, which Dees compares favorably to material by the legendary Bill Monroe. <br><br>&quot;Her lyrics are more picturesque and detailed than Monroe&#39;s. She paints a more detailed picture. She gets some of that cold mountain harmony in there, and she&#39;s good at telling stories.&quot; <br><br>Still, Dees admits that he was uncertain what to expect when he watched the gregarious Parton co-host the International Bluegrass Awards in Kentucky a few years back. It didn&#39;t take long, however, for Parton&#39;s stage presence to win him over.<br> &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure what to think because of the level of silliness she plays at on stage, but she doesn&#39;t exhibit any vanity,&quot; he says. &quot;She&#39;s readily willing to make fun of herself. She&#39;s very relaxed about it and it&#39;s pretty amazing, really. Because she&#39;s a huge superstar.&quot; <br><br>Even if she doesn&#39;t act like one, Parton gets superstar treatment in Orlando from the small, tight-knit group of friends and business associates in town to open the Stampede. <br><br>As she strolls through the attraction, Parton is surrounded by a ring of security that might accompany a political candidate. <br><br>Sit down to watch a rehearsal in the same empty section of the arena as the singer, and a man in a dark suit with a two-way radio approaches to check you out. <br><br>He nods grimly at press credentials, then follows the singer closely as she goes downstairs for a dress rehearsal for &quot;Color Me America,&quot; her post-Sept. 11 song that she will sing the next morning on &quot;Today.&quot; <br><br>When a press photographer starts shooting pictures from the stands as Parton rides around the arena in a horse-drawn white carriage, Parton notices the shutter click. Another man in a business shirt and khaki slacks shuffles urgently across the thick sand. <br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asks nervously. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; <br><br>Parton is charming again. &quot;Steve, are you quarrelin&#39; with someone?&quot; she asks, flashing a sweet smile. <br><br>With the opening only hours away, the brusque attitude is a stark contrast to the playful &quot;Aw, shucks!&quot; image of a show that features racing chickens and pigs. <br><br>&quot;If you work for her, you have this great, great respect for her,&quot; says Ted Miller, former general manager of Silver Dollar City theme park in Branson, Mo., who has helped Parton oversee her tourist attractions since 1986. <br><br>&quot;All of the people who work for her truly love her and she loves the people around her. You can call it protective, but it&#39;s really just caring.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s personal assistant, Judy Ogle, has been associated with the singer since they were both in high school. Another adviser has been around since Parton&#39;s days as a duet partner with Porter Wagoner. <br><br>They are a tight family unit and few talk to strangers about their boss. Miller says there are reasons that Parton inspires such loyalty. <br><br>&quot;She&#39;s very astute, but she has that sense of what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong, both in a moral sense and in a business sense. Her judgment is unquestionable and her standards are high, but her greatest strength is her openness and honesty.&quot; <br><br>Miller says Parton&#39;s bluegrass revival is a result of all those factors. <br><br>&quot;Part of it is good business sense, but part of it is that she&#39;s just at a stage in her career when she can be creative and do things that she wants. She doesn&#39;t have to do a certain kind of album just to be in the mainstream. She has fun doing what she&#39;s doing.&quot; <br><br>It does look like she&#39;s having fun when a procession of reporters are escorted into an upstairs office for 10-minute interviews that are strictly timed, like everything on opening day. <br><br>&quot;Did you like the sweet tea?&quot; Parton chirps. <br><br>Uh, there was only unsweetened tea at a show that, incidentally, also serves no alcohol. <br><br>Turns out Parton is recalling a meal she ordered out from a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant. It&#39;s the kind of place you would expect a country gal to go. <br><br>Nor is it surprising that Parton spent down time in Orlando inside the cozy confines of her tour bus, parked in a corner of the attraction&#39;s parking lot, rather than in a high-end hotel room reserved for her. <br><br>She plans to do more bluegrass music, though her current priority is &quot;For God and Country,&quot; an album of patriotic and gospel music set for mid-September release. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do one,&quot; she says, adding that it&#39;s not a Sept. 11 statement. &quot;It wasn&#39;t just that. It&#39;s the war; it&#39;s the times. There&#39;s a lot of fear, a lot of doubt. Everybody&#39;s looking to God.&quot; <br><br>Though a new Parton tribute album features contemporary stars such as Melissa Etheridge and Norah Jones, there&#39;s no certainty that radio will embrace Parton&#39;s new work. She isn&#39;t critical. <br><br>&quot;I have no complaints because it&#39;s been so good to me over the years. I&#39;ve lived so long that my past has caught up with me.&quot; <br><br>A few minutes later, Parton is chauffeured in a golf cart to her bus, where two fans clutching albums are waiting. The singer is quickly escorted up the stairs and the door closes. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">A&amp;U</font><br><font size="2">July 2003</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Songbird With A Mission</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>All-around superstar Dolly Parton credits bluegrass/mountain folk music with re-energizing her career, but the surprisingly modest lady from Appalachia may be one of the very reasons bluegrass is having a renaissance.

Snicker if you will, but this diminutive powerhouse with the unforgettable voice and gentle heart has been working a business plan for nearly forty years. Her plans and goals, and her many accomplishments, have been impressive. Still, Dolly (yes, she is one of those people who can wield a single name) has been heralded in the past year or so for her, er, comeback. <br><br>I wasn&rsquo;t sure she ever went far enough away to warrant a comeback. Even if her album sales had not been what they once were, Dolly certainly kept busy, and has remained more visible than most artists. Period. Her visibility is at least due in part to her versatility. And it is that versatility that has led to her resurgence. <br><br>Dolly has sampled and succeeded at musical genres from old-time country and spiritual classics to pop and disco (what other country queen would dare tackle a dance remix of Cat Stevens&rsquo;s <i>Peace Train</i>?), moved easily into movies, out-themed theme parks, and re-invented herself more times than Madonna ever thought about.<br> Sevier County, Tennessee&rsquo;s most famous daughter went back to her roots, so to speak, with two bluegrass albums, the Grammy-winning <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> album in 1999, and its 2001 follow up, <i>Little Sparrow</i>. She kept up the pace in 2002, keeping a bluegrass feel, but adding some country back to the mix with <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>. By late 2002, <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> neared the top of Billboard&rsquo;s country chart, all the while faring well on the pop list too. Dolly Parton began her fifty-seventh year with her best album sales in seven years. Her most recent release is <i>Ultimate Dolly Parton</i>, a first-ever career-spanning collection of twenty songs from BMG Heritage that she oversaw personally. <br><br>Surely people realize, as Dolly herself put it, &quot;that there is a brain underneath the hair and a heart underneath the boobs.&quot; If you don&rsquo;t already know that, all you have to do is observe the respect afforded to Dolly by her peers and people in the business of entertainment. Or hear about the singer&rsquo;s many philanthropic commitments, some of them many years in the making. <br><br>Knowing a bit about her life&rsquo;s work, we asked for an opportunity to bring Dolly to our readers. Lucky for us all, the Smoky Mountain Phenomenon agreed, and corresponded with <i>A&amp;U</i>&rsquo;s B. Andrew Plant. Perhaps she consented because Drew also hails from East Tennessee, we thought. Still, we found that Dolly talked to us&ndash;for you&ndash;because she is indeed as caring as she is talented. <br><br>Above all, Dolly is honest. She is the first to say that, like many of us, the emergence of the AIDS pandemic was foreign to her. &quot;As you probably know, I came from the country in East Tennessee, and I suppose I was as naive and ignorant as anyone,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;When I went to Los Angeles, I became best friends with my manager, Sandy Gallin, who is gay. Many of Sandy&rsquo;s associates, friends, and creative teams were gay people. They are some of the finest, most creative folks there are. <br><br>&quot;Because I became friends with many of them, like Steve Rubell of Studio 54&hellip;in New York, it wasn&rsquo;t long before I learned firsthand of the devastating impact of AIDS,&quot; she says. &quot;I have lost many dear friends from it&hellip;both gay and heterosexual. That&rsquo;s when I really began to understand and get involved in the fight.&quot;<br> And get involved she did, though, in characteristic Dolly fashion, she downplays her own good works. &quot;My Sandollar Productions Company [named for both Sandy (Gallin) and Dolly] was responsible for the public awareness production of the Common Threads quilt program that traveled all over the nation,&quot; Dolly says.<br> &quot;I guess I could have been more prominently involved, but I helped. It was Howard Rosenman, Carol Baum, and Sandy that really led the project.&quot; <br><br>The quilt event the singer-actress-businesswoman refers to is the Academy Award-winning (for Best Documentary) <i>Common Threads: Stories From The Quilt</i>. <i>Common Threads</i>, which also won a Peabody Award for Outstanding Journalism, tells the story of the first decade of AIDS though five different stories, woven together via the NAMES Project/AIDS Memorial Quilt. <br><br>It should be noted that the names of the Common Threads leaders Dolly rattles off so easily should not be taken lightly. (Here she is casually teaming up with some of Hollywood&rsquo;s elite for the cause.) Howard Rosenman was a Sandollar executive and has gone on to develop and produce many big-name movies and events for key Hollywood players and organizations. Rosenman also is a co-founder of Project Angel Food in Los Angeles, which provides &quot;meals on wheels&quot; for people with AIDS, and served on the Board of Directors for AIDS Research Alliance, an organization working to find effective drug therapies. Carol Baum is a producer who has since worked on films such as <i>The Good Girl</i>, <i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>, and <i>Father of the Bride II</i>. <br><br>And, if you don&rsquo;t know who Gallin is, you may at least remember media reports last year surrounding a Vanity Fair magazine interviewee who speculated that Hollywood was controlled by a &quot;gay mafia.&quot; As the story went, this mafia was dominated by David Geffen, Barry Diller, and Sandy Gallin. (Well, all of those gentlemen are indeed entertainment industry leaders.) <br><br>Gallin&rsquo;s thirty-five-year career has included time as an agent, producer and personal manager, representing not only Dolly, but the likes of Michael Jackson, Neil Diamond, and Cher. In addition to producing feature films, Las Vegas entertainment and Broadway shows, he was one of the founders of the aforementioned Project Angel Food and has been a trustee of AIDS Project Los Angeles, one of the first and largest AIDS service organizations. <br><br>Interacting with luminaries like this not only helped Dolly achieve her best, but they also are likely part of the reason she is comfortable in the knowledge that HIV does not discriminate, as she related to me. &quot;&lsquo;Gay&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t something you do. It is something you are!&quot; she exclaims. &quot;Of course, in the beginning everyone thought it was just a gay disease, and it has taken too long to get everyone to understand otherwise.&quot; <br><br>I asked Dolly (okay, I addressed her as &quot;Ms. Parton,&quot; wouldn&rsquo;t you?) why it seems the country music industry has been slower to come out publicly in the battle against AIDS when the entertainment industry, and music industry in general, have been so present in the crisis. <br><br>&quot;I think country musicians, in general, have not been as involved in the fight because many of them come from the country like I did,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;Maybe there were [fewer people with AIDS] or&hellip;maybe those who contracted it moved off to the city for care or to avoid family conflicts over their lifestyle. In any event, I think that will change greatly in the future.&quot; <br><br>That said, this dynamo who does a lot and takes credit for much less, wonders if too much is sometimes asked of the famous. &quot;Sometimes I think too much pressure is put on celebrities to help a specific cause,&quot; she says, &quot;when they are maybe spending their time and energy helping [some other cause]. Some help [people with] diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, or the poor, the handicapped and so on&hellip;.Most of us help a specific project or need because it has touched us personally.&quot; <br><br>The havoc HIV wreaks is by all means on Dolly&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll-do-what-I-can list. &quot;Certainly, I might have done more and earlier, but I feel good about what I have done and am doing,&quot; she says. &quot;At Dollywood, at least twice each year, when I am there, we have a special Make-A-Wish get-together. Many times, there have been kids, moms, and men that have the AIDS virus.&quot; <br><br>Dollywood, of course, is the one-woman conglomerate&rsquo;s theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, near where she grew up. She opened the park, which has grown to include myriad entertainment venues, crafts, a museum, a water park and more, to showcase her &quot;neck of the woods&quot; and her heritage. <br><br>Dolly, not surprisingly, believes in family, many of whom are involved with the theme park and her other businesses, and has strong beliefs about giving back. So her response was easy when I asked her about any other contributions in the realm of AIDS, which we might not know about. <br><br>&quot;I believe we all should help others through several projects,&quot; Dolly says, &quot;as payback for our success....For example, Elizabeth Taylor, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Hanks, and [projects like] the movie Philadelphia, [and Red Hot + Country, to which Dolly contributed a track] have chosen to raise funds directly for AIDS research, hopefully to find a cure. I have donated to many of these projects and others, also.&quot; <br><br>The lives of superstars are of course no less touched by the Modern Plague than others, as evidenced by the story Dolly relates to me of just one of the ways she has personally been affected by AIDS. &quot;One of the dearest people in the world and a special friend was Tony Chase,&quot; she says. &quot;Tony designed hundreds of my most special gowns.&quot; <br><br>And, if you can picture some of Dolly&rsquo;s elaborate, sequined outfits, her admiration of Chase&rsquo;s talent is quite a compliment. &quot;He contracted AIDS, and I helped him with medicine and financially,&quot; she says. &quot;I kept Tony close to me until the end. I&rsquo;ve lost some family members and in-laws, also&hellip;.Some were gay and some were not. Just recently, we lost Herb Ritts&hellip;another dear, dear friend.&quot; <br><br>As Dolly&rsquo;s many business ventures are interconnected, so too are her community contributions. Or she hopes they will be, anyway. Even if the connections may not be clear at first glance. <br><br>&quot;My main focus [philanthropically] is on children and their early education and inspiration,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I believe that many of the problems we have in the world are because we just aren&rsquo;t smart enough. I think things like my Imagination Library program will help us. Maybe one of my kids will grow up to be a doctor who is smart enough to find a cure [for AIDS]. <br><br>&quot;In the meantime, I believe we all should donate more time and money to this cause,&quot; she says, emphasizing that she knows the immense challenge HIV presents. &quot;We are just now barely beginning to understand it&hellip;.&quot; <br><br>How does Dolly deal with life&rsquo;s great challenges? My guess was music and it sounds like I was correct (okay, it was an easy guess, given that the interview is with a top-selling musical artist!). <br><br>&quot;You had asked me about music that helps me or inspires me when dealing with things like this,&quot; she says. &quot;I&rsquo;ve written a few, like &quot;Hello, God&quot;, that is my reflection on September 11, wars, disease and world problems&ndash;but my favorite is &quot;Farther Along,&quot; the old gospel hymn&hellip;.&quot;<br> And she quotes: &quot;Farther along, we&rsquo;ll know all about it. Farther along, we&rsquo;ll understand why.&quot; <br><br>Then, with the homespun simplicity that makes Dolly so charming and witty, and real&ndash;she closes our correspondence with a straightforward, powerful statement. One you know she means. &quot;Anyway,&quot; she concludes, &quot;I will keep trying to do more, and I hope others will stand up for what they believe in and all of us do our part.&quot;<br> It seems at first like an oversimplification, but that&rsquo;s the straightforward charm of Dolly. She sees a problem or a goal, sets a plan and gets to work. If her past successes are any indication, we know having this voice among those battling AIDS lends greatly to our chances of beating the disease. <br><br><font face="Garamond" size="2">B.

Middle school kids would choose a &quot;buddy&quot; to encourage them to stay in school. Upon graduation, Dolly personally presented each of them with a $500 scholarship. The program is credited with helping reduce the dropout rate in Sevier County from thirty-five percent to less than fifteen percent.<br> Other programs include a pilot first-grade teacher assistant program, adding a teacher and assistant for the County&rsquo;s Alternative Learning program, computer labs for a Principals of Alphabet Literacy program, teacher training, after-school tutoring, guidance counselors, and emergency support for children for school clothes and supplies. <br><br>Dolly&rsquo;s biggest Foundation effort may be the Imagination Library. Begun in 1995 to stimulate young minds and encourage a love of reading and learning, the program provides one book per month to all pre-school children (birth until age five) in Sevier County. Each child begins with Dolly&rsquo;s choice, and this seems so fitting, The Little Engine That Could. The Foundation even provides the bookcase for each child to store their books. <br><br>Imagination Library has been a success (like most things Dolly touches) and is being replicated in communities across the country. Of the Imagination Library expansion, Dolly recently said, &quot;People are starting to call me &lsquo;the Book Lady.&rsquo; You know you&rsquo;re getting old when you like being called the Book Lady!&quot; <br><br>Dolly (and other celebrities&ndash;who could say &quot;no&quot; to Dolly?) perform annual benefit concerts to support the Foundation and its many different programs, including the Library; these efforts have raised several million dollars. <br><br>And then there are Make-A-Wish days at Dollywood, and Dolly&rsquo;s quieter giving efforts, and so much more. <br><br>Just after her January 19 birthday this year, a fundraising CD, Respond II, was released, featuring Dolly and other female performers. The two-CD set benefits families affected by domestic violence. Dolly&rsquo;s &quot;Endless Stream of Tears,&quot; from her The Grass Is Blue album, is her contribution to the set.

Inviting your correspondent to pose for a picture, she attacks from the blindside and sinks her red nails deep into my derri&egrave;re. I threaten to sue. &quot;Well, I won&#39;t pay honey,&quot; she playfully drawls. Indeed, &quot;working out what pays&quot; has repeatedly defined Dolly Parton&#39;s life and career. <br><br>In the Country Music Hall Of Fame a quote summarizes Dolly as having &quot;the heart of an artist, the brain of a computer and the spirit of a preacher&quot;. And, one might add, the drive of an entrepreneur. In the next months she will be appearing in Graham Norton&#39;s Christmas Special in Dollywood (which just celebrated its 30 millionth visitor), releasing a dance mix of Jolene and working on TV and film projects. <br><br>Thankfully, in the midst of her multibranding, the 57-year-old has also made two of the finest records in her 71-album history, 1999&#39;s <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and 2001&#39;s <i>Little Sparrow</i>. Her first all acoustic albums, Parton calls their blend of bluegrass and folk &quot;genuine blue mountain music&quot;. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the real Dolly Parton that came out of the Smoky Mountains as a little girl,&quot; she says. &quot;This is the music I would have been doing all along if I could have made a living at it. It&#39;s like I had to get rich in order to sing like I was poor.&quot; <br><br>For a genre obsessed with notions of down-home tradition, country has always had an unhealthy preoccupation with aspirational glamour. Early on in her career Dolly figured that people wouldn&#39;t pay to see something that they could already hear for free at home or in church. <br><br>&quot;I realized,&quot; she says, &quot;that you&#39;re not going to make any money doing it. And I needed to be in the music business. I needed a band, I needed buses, costumes and clothes for the band. So I started trying to be commercial and look at the business end of the music business. And so that&#39;s basically what I did to try to become everything that I could possibly be. No matter what kind of records I recorded, they were always half-assed compared to what my real stuff is. Even when I had top records, I wasn&#39;t as comfortable doing those songs but my personality was comfortable pulling it off and getting it done.&quot; <br><br>So Jolene and Here You Go Again were pragmatic compromises? &quot;Well, that&#39;s the art and the challenge of making great pop. Yes, I was thinking of hits, but it&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t personal or special. You think, Oh Lord, just big tits and big hair and all this make-up and all this gob, but still that don&#39;t matter. My look is still country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour is. My heart is as real as those songs I sing. My heart and my gut and my soul is what you hear in the voice and in this music. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t get a lot of modern pop music, it don&#39;t have feeling.&quot; <br><br>Ah, new country. From the late &#39;80s, its slick, neutered sound brought huge sales, left purists despairing and ousted the likes of Parton, Cash and Haggard from the commercial airwaves. Initially frustrated, Parton now feels it left the old guard free to record unadorned albums like <i>Little Sparrow</i>, <i>Solitary Man</i>, and <i>Roots Volume 1</i>. <br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t have a record deal,&quot; says Parton. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get on the radio if I tried. But my life was good and my business was good. I was certainly not having to do it for money, but I still loved the work. I realized, You are a writer and a singer so why don&#39;t you just do it? So I paid for the sessions myself. I thought, I&#39;m gonna go in and sing what I want. I don&#39;t care if the song is seven minutes long. I don&#39;t have to cut it down for radio. I&#39;m gonna record what I want to. I pay for this stuff myself and lease it to the company.&quot; <br><br>A Grammy and critical praise won, a third installment of &quot;blue mountain music&quot; is planned. &quot;I want to ride this train as far as it can go,&quot; she says, &quot;&#39;cos I love this music and it&#39;s true to my heart and soul. Although I would still love to have some great hit records, I have no kids but I have about 100 nephews and nieces, all of whom need a car when they graduate. I still gotta be as successful as I can.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Mountain Press</font><br><font size="2">April 7, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly embarks on new adventure</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mountain Press" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE - In typical rollicking Dolly Parton fashion, the mega entertainer showed off more than just cleavage Friday. <br><br>She came home to Sevier County for the debut of her new Adventures in Imagination attraction at Dollywood. <br><br>And no, she&#39;s not running for governor. <br><br>Parton mingled with the media and Dollywood passholders during the day, showing off a motion ride and memorabilia museum, held a press conference and then performed an eight-song concert that included tunes from an upcoming CD. <br><br>&quot;Y&#39;all think I could run for governor?&quot; Parton asked a crowd that applauded in support at her press conference. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know much about that and now everybody&#39;s calling thinking I&#39;m running for governor and it&#39;s big joke in our house. And my husband, now anytime I ask him to do anything, or tell him to do anything, he&#39;ll say, &#39;Oh, yes, your Governess.&#39; <br><br>&quot;So it&#39;s like that&#39;s all I hear.

It&#39;s not being billed as a museum, but features a good chunk of Parton&#39;s life and career. <br><br>Photographs line the walls throughout, and upstairs in the &quot;attic,&quot; Parton comes on screen to talk about what the memories mean to her and her taste in such items as clothing and carpet. <br><br>Guests will see Parton&#39;s Sevier County High School band uniform, listen to an old recording of her first single, &quot;Puppy Love,&quot; and can read love letters she saved. <br><br>And if you want to see what you&#39;d look like in a variety of Parton&#39;s wig styles, you can, through animated wig stations. There are plenty of clothes, concocted from colors and in combinations not usually found in nature, in all sorts of Parton-esque styles.<br> While under photographs of Parton&#39;s family tree at Chasing Rainbows, she was presented the first Chasing Rainbows Award by the National State Teachers of the Year Organization for her work with literacy. The award will be displayed in the museum, and each year a teacher will be honored. <br><br>&quot;Of course, I hated school more than anybody in the world...I do more homework now just studying everything about the imagination than I did the whole 12 years I was in school. <br><br>&quot;But I am just so happy that God has seen fit to put me in a position to, not only enjoy my success and have a good living at what I love to do, but to be able to come back and do things for the folks in this county here and especially the little kids.&quot; <br><br>For the first time in 10 years, Parton has formed a band and plans to tour with the group she has dubbed The Blueniques. <br><br>Parton&#39;s concert, during which she performed &quot;Train Train,&quot; &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; and her version of &quot;Shine,&quot; by Collective Soul, was open to the public. <br><br>Ever the workaholic, Parton has been toiling on a new CD, &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; which is due out in July.

There&#39;s one song on there that&#39;s really special to me. It&#39;s called &#39;Hello, God.&#39; It&#39;s a song I wrote right after Sept. 11th. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s like, &#39;Hello, God, are you out there? Can you hear us? Are you listening any more? Are we still on speaking terms? Can you help us?&#39;...Several of the pieces on the album were really my feelings and my thoughts.&quot; <br><br>Parton will perform in Minneapolis May 17 to help children of victims in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks further their education. <br><br>&quot;We were going to do the &#39;Red, White and Bluegrass&#39;&quot; show in Nashville on New Year&#39;s Eve as a benefit for the scholarship program, Parton said. <br><br>That benefit was postponed. <br><br>Parton said she and her newly formed band, The Blueniques, will probably do some sort of benefit while on tour July 4 and Sept. 11 as well. Parton said she hasn&#39;t toured or had a band for 10 years. <br><br>The high-energy entertainer should be able to handle the rigors of touring. After all, she just pulled off her parade in Pigeon Forge and the grand opening for Dollywood&#39;s 17th season. <br><br>&quot;You actually have to drink a lot of coffee and get enough sleep, but it&#39;s been fun,&quot; Parton said Friday between satellite television interviews during Media Day activities at Dollywood. &quot;I think I just live on raw energy and the adrenalin keeps me high because every time I do this it&#39;s very exciting and fun and we love it.&quot; <br><br>It was late in the afternoon, but Parton would hopefully get some down time before her Pigeon Forge parade. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got about an hour-and-a-half to have supper and relax,&quot; Parton said. &quot;Actually, the night ends early for me because as soon as the parade&#39;s over I&#39;ll make it an early night. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s when I&#39;ll relax. Then I can come back and tear down, take all the fancy clothes off and all the hair and the makeup and just sit up in bed and watch TV and eat like a pig.&quot; <br><br>Parton has been busy with television and film projects. <br><br>&quot;I have several things for TV. I&#39;m still working on the Mae West story, which is real close to being ready to be done,&quot; she said. &quot;There is a movie coming out next month, it&#39;s a crazy teen-age comedy move. I play the mother of the star.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s last two CDs have been fawned over by critics. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just proud to have been part of country music all my life,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I don&#39;t begrudge any of the new people that are successes. I&#39;m still out there loving and doing my own records now...It&#39;s beginning to take on a whole new life of its own.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s not planning a run for governor of Tennessee, as has been widely rumored, but she&#39;d have no problems speaking to Congress about the importance of her Imagination Library program to promote literacy. <br><br>&quot;Absolutely, I can see myself doing that,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to run for governor, but I can definitely see myself being political about issues I love and want to do. I may very well do that.&quot; <br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean she thinks her poke-fun-at-herself image is changing.<br> &quot;No, I don&#39;t. The kids call me &#39;The Book Lady,&#39; but I still look like the same trash I always did,&quot; Parton says with a laugh. &quot;I don&#39;t guess I&#39;m ever going to change that. They seem to like me like as I am, so I don&#39;t see no reason to try and change it if it&#39;s working, do you?&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">More Magazine</font><br><font size="2">May 2002<br></font><br><b>Dishing With Dolly</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="More Magazine" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="More Magazine" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>AMERICA&#39;S MOST BELOVED COUNTRY STAR RIFFS ON HER STORIED LIFE. HER RUMORED LOVES, HER ANTI-AGING TECHNIQUES, AND HER NEW MOVIE.<br><br></blockquote> The world will always love Dolly Parton, and not just because she&#39;s one of the most divinely female creations on the planet. Sure, her off-the-charts measurements and towering platinum hair are hard to ignore, but they&#39;re merely rococo embellishments on one formidably talented package. The fourth of 12 children born on a farm in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, Parton has transformed herself into one of country&#39;s biggest crossover sensations, recording more than 50 solo albums, winning seven Grammys and composing more than 3,000 songs. And with the overwhelming success of Dollywood, the self-themed entertainment park she founded in 1986, she&#39;s become a down-home mogul as well. But Parton is not the type to rest on her laurels. This summer, she releases <i>Halos and Horns</i>, her third bluegrass album in four years; this month, she costars with comic Dave Sheridan in Touchstone Pictures&#39; <i>Frank McKlusky, C.I.</i> At 56, Parton is as unstoppable, as unpredictable and as outspoken as ever. <br><br><i>Apparently, your new movie is as outrageous as a Jim Carrey comedy. Why did you decide to do it?</i> <br><br>&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t done a movie in a long time. Because of my age and my personality, I don&#39;t really get a lot of offers. This film is pretty raunchy. I accepted my part before I read the whole script. Then when I did read it, I went, &#39;Oh, my <i>God</i>.&#39; I wondered what the family-oriented people would think. But I had already accepted the movie and I couldn&#39;t back out of it.&quot; <br><br><i>Sounds like it can&#39;t have offended you too much.</i> <br><br>&quot;Well, none of it&#39;s done for the sake of being vulgar. And I never do anything that I don&#39;t feel I can back up in my own way. I&#39;m old enough to know better, but still young enough not to resist.&quot; <br><br><i>Your return to bluegrass in the past four years has been met with so much critical acclaim that you&#39;re going on tour this summer for the first time in ten years. What made you decide to return to your mountain roots?</i> <br><br>&quot;Country music had changed, and people my age certainly were not getting played on the radio. I couldn&#39;t get record labels interested or excited. They look at it as, &#39;You were great, but you&#39;re a has-been.&#39; I&#39;m as good as I ever was. I thought, &#39;I&#39;ll never stop writing songs, if I have to record them myself and sell them out the back of my car!&#39; One day, a friend of mine told me about a survey that had shown that the one person people would love to hear do a bluegrass album was Dolly Parton. I said, &#39;Really? Let&#39;s do one!&#39; It won the Grammy that year.&quot; <br><br><i>That kind of success must be particularly fulfilling now.</i> <br><br>&quot;This is the kind of music I&#39;ve always loved, but I could never make any money at it. I still don&#39;t make any money at it, even though I&#39;ve had two critically acclaimed albums. The joke I&#39;ve always made is that I had to go off and get rich in order to sing like I&#39;m poor again. Now that I&#39;ve done some of everything, I can go back and do really quality music. It&#39;s in every fiber of my body. I call it my Smoky Mountain DNA. I lived with no water, no electricity, no indoor plumbing for years, without knowing there was something else outside of it. When I record these songs, it&#39;s so real to me.&quot; <br><br><i>Didn&#39;t I hear that you&#39;ll be playing Mae West in a TV movie?</i> <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m doing the Mae West story for ABC. I&#39;ve read everything about her, and I&#39;ve always related to her in a way, being little and blonde and bawdy.&quot; <br><br><i>What do you think of the rumor that she was really a man?</i> <br><br>&quot;She just &#39;had balls,&#39; and maybe that&#39;s where they got that. She was more than met the eye; she wasn&#39;t just a sex symbol.&quot; <br><br><i>Similar things have been said about you.</i> <br><br>&quot;Well, I&#39;ve always said I look like a woman but I think like a man. I do have six brothers and a dad and tons of uncles. I understand men. I love men. I know how to hold my place in their area, but I&#39;m still a woman.&quot; <br><br><i>What about you do you think has been the most misunderstood?</i> <br><br>[Laughing] &quot;Oh, many things. People see you doing something and say, &#39;I didn&#39;t know she could do that. I thought she was just tits and hair.&#39; People think I&#39;m as shallow and superficial as I look, and it&#39;s a surprise when they find out, sure enough, I am!&quot; <br><br><i>You&#39;re also quite the gay icon. Why do you think that is?</i> <br><br>&quot;Like I&#39;ve always said, if I hadn&#39;t been a woman I&#39;d have been a drag queen! I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m so accepted in the gay community. Guys either want to dress like me or they appreciate the fact that I&#39;m so out there. I&#39;ve always been myself, and it makes them feel it&#39;s okay to be themselves, whatever they are. Gay is not something you do. It&#39;s something you are.&quot; <br><br><i>You started out so young. When you first went on television at age ten, did you truly appreciate what it all meant?</i> <br><br>&quot;I was singing on television before we owned one, before we even had electricity. I was just this little kid who would pick this big guitar and sing songs I wrote. Since I was from a family of twelve, I didn&#39;t get all that much personal attention. So I just kind of grew from there, because I wanted to impress people. My desire to do stuff was greater man my fear of it. God must really push me people he&#39;s got his hand on.&quot; <br><br><i>Has it been hard being such a success and having so many siblings?</i> <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s been hard and not hard. Some of them have a difficult time dealing with some of it. Some of them don&#39;t at all. Hopefully, they&#39;re all proud of me. So many of them are just as talented as me, but haven&#39;t had the same kind of success. In different times in my life I kinda had a little guilt that I was the one who made it out. But my momma said, &#39;God knows you had a big heart, so he picked the one who&#39;d help me most.&#39;&quot; <br><br><i>You&#39;ve been married to your husband, Carl Dean, for 36 years. But there have also been rumors that you&#39;ve had affairs with everyone from Burt Reynolds to James Woods.</i> <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t deny or admit anything for sure. I&#39;d rather be thought of as passionate and exciting than as some vanilla person who&#39;s never done anything. I always say the best kisser I kissed in the movies was James Woods, who I did <i>Straight Talk</i> with. I saw him with his girlfriend once and I said it right in front of her. And he still is the best kisser I ever kissed, including my husband. People ask me, &#39;Kiss better than Stallone? Kiss better than Burt Reynolds?&#39; I say, &#39;Yeah!&#39; I&#39;ve enjoyed every rumor.&quot; <br><br><i>Dolly, you&#39;ve always had such a positive life outlook. Is it something you have to work at?</i> <br><br>&quot;I was born with a happy heart. I have a good attitude, but when I hurt, I hurt all over. I&#39;ve been through many sad things, back when I was going through the darkest time of my life.&quot; <br><br><i>Was that in the early Eighties?</i> <br><br>&quot;Yes. I was overweight, having a lot of female problems, having some personal problems as well. Everybody comes to a place where you have to make some decisions. You&#39;re fat. You&#39;re miserable. You&#39;ve got to get on a diet and decide what you want to do with your life. I had worked so hard, and suddenly, I was a middle-aged woman. It hit me all at once. Getting through that time was the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me slow down and pick the wheat from the chaff. I still have hard times, but I won&#39;t let it get me down. You gotta work at being happy, like you gotta work at being miserable.&quot; <br><br><i>How did you learn to stay thin?</i> <br><br>&quot;I went on every diet there ever was. I did Optifast at UCLA. I was monitored and lost thirty pounds. I did the Atkins diet, the Scarsdale diet, I did everything I could to get the weight off. And the way I&#39;ve maintained it is to just eat small portions of what I like. I don&#39;t eat diet foods or drink diet drinks.&quot; <br><br><i>Anything left that&#39;s still an indulgence?</i> <br><br>&quot;Potatoes are my weakness. Au gratin. Fried. Hashed. Every diet I fell off of was because of potatoes. You just have to watch it when you are this short and have an appetite this big.&quot; <br><br><i>How would you describe your style?</i> <br><br>&quot;I have no class and no style! But I&#39;m happy doing what I do. The fact that it all looks so totally artificial but that I&#39;m so totally real has created a bit of magic.&quot; <br><br><i>You once said your look was inspired by the town tramp. Was there really a town tramp where you grew up?</i> <br><br>&quot;There truly was. She probably didn&#39;t do near as much stuff as she was accused of, but everyone said she was trash. She wore high-heel shoes and had red fingernails and red lipstick. I thought she was beautiful, and that&#39;s what I wanted to look like. I wanted my boobs to stick out. I wanted to wear sweaters. I wanted yellow hair. It&#39;s a country girl&#39;s idea of glamour.&quot; <br><br><i>Do you ever get tired of all the painting and powdering it takes to look like Dolly Parton?</i> <br><br>&quot;I love it. It&#39;s like painting with crayons every day. I love makeup. I love loud colors and beautiful clothes and jewelry. I hate being plain. Even when I&#39;m around the house, I can only go so long without putting on some lipstick. I&#39;ll walk by the mirror and go, &#39;Who is that hag? I don&#39;t care to know her!&#39;&quot; <br><br><i>You&#39;ve been upfront in the past about having a few nips and tucks. What&#39;s the latest plastic surgery you&#39;ve had?</i> <br><br>&quot;My husband cut up all my credit cards.&quot; <br><br><i>Come on.</i> <br><br>&quot;I haven&#39;t had any in a long time. That&#39;s not to say that I won&#39;t when I need it.&quot; <br><br><i>Any anti-aging techniques?</i> <br><br>&quot;I think attitude is the greatest asset that anybody can ever have. I never allow myself to think that I&#39;m old. The key is finding joy in what you do. And don&#39;t sit on your old ass and just go to seed.&quot; <br><br><i>I read somewhere that you thought the years from 50 to 100 would be the best of your life. How&#39;s it turning out so far?</i> <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s turning out great. To be honest with you, I worked so hard the first half of my life; sometimes you can go so fast and meet yourself coming back from the other direction. I just turned fifty-six last week. I feel the same way I did when I left home. The funny thing about getting old is you don&#39;t realize it. Now, I feel so lucky. I have almost a whole new career with my music again. I&#39;m as old as yesterday, as new as tomorrow. As long as I&#39;m living, I&#39;m going to be always hustling.&quot; <br><br><i>Is there still a lot you want to accomplish?</i> <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m very involved in education and youth programs with The Dollywood Foundation and The Imagination Library. I love kids; I never had any of my own. I&#39;d love to do some great things in the world of children&#39;s books. I want to have a line of Southern foods called Dolly&#39;s Dixie Fixin&#39;s. And I want to continue doing movies. I don&#39;t ever intend to stop.&quot; <br><br><i>So you don&#39;t ever want to retire?</i> <br><br>&quot;Absolutely not! I hope to die on the spot doing a joyful project at a hundred.&quot; <br><br><i>One last thing, Dolly: Who would you like to play you in a movie of your life?</i> <br><br>&quot;Me! What the hell are you talking about?&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">London Independent</font><br><font size="2">June 30, 2002<br></font><br><b>Dolly Parton: &#39;I look like a woman but I think like a man&#39;</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="London Independent" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="London Independent" width="455"></div><br><br>The voluptuous, country and western singer Dolly Parton, 56, was raised in poverty with 11 brothers and sisters on a farm in Tennessee before heading for Nashville as a teenager. Since then she has had hit album after hit album; received Grammys and Oscar nominations for classics such as &quot;Nine to Five&quot;, &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;; established a reputation as an actress; and opened a theme park, Dollywood, near her home in Williamson County, Tennessee. Parton, whose latest album <i>Halos and Horns</i> is out in July, lives with her husband of 36 years, Carl Dean. <br><br><b>You are a formidable businesswoman and very independent. Do you consider yourself a feminist?</b><b><br></b> No, I consider myself feminine. I consider myself a woman with some talent and some power, some guts and some spunk, but I would have been that if I&#39;d been a man. I think women should be treated equally, and I&#39;m going to see to it that I am.<br> <b>You&#39;re known for your curves. Have they ever got you into trouble?</b><b><br></b> Well yes, but that&#39;s why I had curves, I wanted them to get me into trouble. I&#39;ve never felt like I couldn&#39;t handle it. I had six brothers; I totally understand and love men. Some women are intimidated by them but I&#39;ve always known how to manoeuvre. I look like a woman but I think like a man. <br><br><b>Would you leave the house without make-up?</b><b><br></b> Not unless Carl was dead. Maybe if I had to get him to the hospital in the middle of the night, but I&#39;m not even sure about that, I might make him hang on so I could at least get a little lipstick on. But seriously though, when I&#39;m in California, they&#39;re so prone to earthquakes you never know when you&#39;re going to have to run out in the street, so usually I&#39;ll sleep with my make-up on, well, at least my eye make-up. I wouldn&#39;t go out without it, I&#39;d rather be dead. <br><br><b>You&#39;ve had some nips and tucks over the years...</b><b><br></b> Oh sure. I&#39;m gonna have some more when I need them. <b>What would you recommend most?</b><b><br></b> I&#39;ve done mine in little bits and pieces so I couldn&#39;t say for sure, but I think that&#39;s the way you should do it. Instead of having some godawful great body lift or huge facelift, you should take care of the little problem areas as they come up and then you don&#39;t ever look weird. But I&#39;d recommend everything I&#39;ve had done. Whatever I see that&#39;s bagging, dragging or sagging, I just go fix it. <br><br><b>Your look is quite brassy. Are you hiding a private self behind it?</b><b><br></b> No, I think I&#39;ve been around long enough for people to pretty much know what I&#39;m about. Of course a lot of how I look comes out of a place of insecurity or just a country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour is. I wear high heels because I&#39;m short. I wear long fingernails because my hands are short. I wear my big hairdos and wigs and stuff because my hair won&#39;t do what I want it to. So any negatives I have I turn into positives. <br><br><b>Is it about being a celebrity?</b><b><br></b> I would do it even if I wasn&#39;t in showbusiness. I would be a waitress spending all my wages on make-up and bleach and high-heeled shoes. I think of my make-up as a box of crayons and I look at myself as a blank canvas, I like getting paint on there. It makes me feel better. I&#39;m not a natural beauty. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m beautiful with all that shit either, it&#39;s just that&#39;s what I enjoy and what makes me comfortable.<br> <b>Your new album&#39;s about sinners and saints. Have you got a heightened sense of guilt?</b><b><br></b> My grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher and I think that all people who were brought up in a fundamental church like I was are left with some sort of guilt when they stray a little bit. But I don&#39;t agree with it. What I say is I&#39;m too good to be bad and too bad to be good, I&#39;m sort of caught somewhere in the middle. <br><br><b>You grew up with 11 brothers and sisters. Weren&#39;t you desperate for a bit of peace and quiet?</b><b><br></b> Yes I was. When I was a kid there were eight children younger than me and when they were crying all night, I used to think, God, if I could just get out this house and go somewhere that&#39;s quiet. That&#39;s why I&#39;d take my guitar and go out to the barn or up to the woods. But after I moved to Nashville, those first few weeks, I just about died. It was like where are y&#39;all? I&#39;d have given anything to hear the baby crying, or have some toenails digging into my shinbones in the middle of the night. <br><br><b>Did having so many screaming kids around have anything to do with your decision not to have your own?</b><b><br></b> No, in the early days me and my husband thought we wanted children so we didn&#39;t do anything to stop them for many years. But then I raised five of my brothers and sisters, and they&#39;ve had their own children too. I don&#39;t know that I would have been a great mother, but I made a great aunt and I make a really great granny. They all call me aunt granny. <br><br><b>How are you different to the teenage girl who arrived in Nashville in 1964?</b><b><br></b> I&#39;m the same girl I was then. I&#39;ve never moved away from my home and my family and I still wake up every day and feel like I&#39;m just starting my career, I still love what I do. But as the years pass by, well, if you go along with the idea that wisdom comes with age I&#39;m certainly old enough to be real smart! I guess I&#39;ve learned what to do and what not to do. I&#39;ve learned to watch what comes out of my mouth, my daddy said it&#39;s better to choose what you say instead of say what you choose. I&#39;ve learned to temper myself and pace myself and not to burn myself out. You have to learn these things and they can only come with time. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">CDNOW Interview</font><br><font size="2">July 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton: Is That a Bustle in Your Hedgerow, or Are You Just Happy to See Me?</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="CDNOW Interview" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="CDNOW Interview" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>Yep, Dolly Parton sings &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; on her new disc, <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>. What <i>was</i> she thinking?<br><b><br></b></blockquote> Unlike her past couple discs, Dolly Parton&#39;s <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> isn&#39;t a bluegrass record. Fans who&#39;ve enjoyed the mountain-inspired acoustic music of in the recent <i>Little Sparrow</i> and <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> should find plenty to like in the 56-year-old country singer&#39;s new disc. &quot;Not for Me&quot; is one of Parton&#39;s oldest songs, written when she was just a teenager. &quot;These Old Bones&quot; is much newer, a tale about a reclusive mountain clairvoyant. And though she&#39;s not using the Nashville session giants that played on her past couple records, she&#39;s got a bunch of top-rate pickers on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>. In fact, they&#39;ll accompany her on a summer tour. <br><br>Despite its mostly acoustic arrangements, <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> represents a turn back toward Parton&#39;s country-pop sound. She revives &quot;What a Heartache,&quot; a tune from the soundtrack of <i>Rhinestone</i>, her 1984 film flop with Sylvester Stallone. She also remakes Bread&#39;s &#39;70s pop hit &quot;If.&quot; Then there&#39;s that other cover, of a much more famous tune&hellip; <br><br><b>CDNOW: Why did you cover &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;?</b><b><br></b> Dolly Parton: I had always been going to do &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; In fact, I talked to Alison Krauss. I was wanting to do a duet album with her. We never did get around to it, because both of us were working so hard. But I remember saying to Alison, &quot;One song I&#39;d like us to try is Led Zeppelin&#39;s &#39;Stairway to Heaven.&#39;&quot; And she just looked at me. I don&#39;t know if that meant, &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s a very interesting idea,&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m singing on that,&quot; or &quot;Have you lost your mind?&quot; I never did know exactly what her look was. <br><br><b>What did Led Zeppelin think of it?</b><b><br></b> They liked it. [Robert Plant] loved that I had treated it in the spiritual way, because he always thought that it was more spiritual in his own mind. So I was thrilled that they accepted it. I just added a few little things, just to make it fit the choir, the fact that I was using it more like a &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br><b>&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; makes a lot more sense when you listen to it in the context of the rest of the album. It fits with the supernatural tone set by many of your original songs.</b><b><br></b> Well, it was very spiritual to me. It was very personal. <br><br>Actually, I didn&#39;t head out to just produce this album. I was doing demos of songs I had written. I went up home; I was auditioning to put a group together for the first time in 10 years. I thought a good way to audition some of these musicians [would be] to demo some of these songs I&#39;ve written anyway. That&#39;s how we got in. <br><br>We did &quot;Stairway&quot; and &quot;If&quot; last. I had done about 25 of my songs I had written since last April. We just went in, and it started sounding so good that we&#39;ve got enough stuff for another album or two, if we go this route again. <br><br><b>Is there any song that you would be afraid to do, that you just couldn&#39;t touch?</b><b><br></b> Not if it was a song I liked. There would be nothing I&#39;d be afraid to do if I had ever thought about doing it. But there are certainly some songs I couldn&#39;t sing. <br><br><b>Talk about the new song &quot;These Old Bones.&quot;</b><b><br></b> Everybody loves that &ndash; because people love a story. They love a ghost story. And I had the &quot;Mountain Angel&quot; in the other one [<i>Little Sparrow</i>]. People love old stories, and I love to write them. <br><br>I want to try to have some sort of a ghostly, weird, mountain story on each album &ndash; from now on, on this type of an album. I&#39;m already thinking about what I might do for the next one. <br><br>People are so responding to me doing this voice. It&#39;s almost like I could do a series off of this, like where I&#39;ll go back up to get the billy goat and the cat and the bones and find all the stuff my mother&#39;s written down and all these stories and all these people that she&#39;s encountered through the years. I can actually create all these different stories that I found in mother&#39;s stuff, in an old trunk. Then you go back into that voice. Even though she&#39;s dead when I tell the story or read the thing, I can create a whole new story every time. <br><br>In fact, I&#39;ve already got a title called &quot;Beulah&#39;s Bastard.&quot; I want to maybe do it with this old woman&#39;s voice, about this girl that had an unwed baby, and everybody called it Beulah&#39;s Bastard, but he grew up to be like a great healer. I keep coming up with all these thoughts, so I thought, well, this could be a new voice, the old lady, if I wanted to. <br><br><b>&quot;Not for Me&quot; comes from very early in your career.</b><b><br></b> I don&#39;t even remember writing it. I just know that I did.<br> That was so long ago. The reason that it&#39;s on this record, I was looking for some old stuff for the museum. That&#39;s our new addition to Dollywood this year &ndash; that and a simulator ride. I was looking for a particular song that they could use up there. <br><br><b>Which one?</b><b><br></b> I don&#39;t remember now what they wound up using. I think it was something about my grandpa. There was a whole bunch of songs on this tape, and when we came across that one, actually, I was just looking for the song, and that one started playing. I thought, &quot;What is that? That&#39;s a really good guitar lick.&quot; &#39;Cause I was picking the guitar. I thought, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s really a beautiful melody.&quot; <br><br>I have tons and tons of stuff like that. I need to go through a lot of that old stuff. Because I didn&#39;t change one word in that, nor one note from the way that I found it on the tape. We just did the chord chart and did it. I&#39;m just saying it was the exact words and the exact melody. I was proud of that. I thought, &quot;Wow. This is as up to date as then.&quot; <br><br><b>Another old song that sounds current is &quot;Shattered Image,&quot; since you&#39;re back in the tabloids these days.</b><b><br></b> I know, I&#39;m always in the tabloids. It wasn&#39;t just for me, but it&#39;s the way other people feel. I thought it was a very commercial idea. But it&#39;s not just about stars and the tabloids; it&#39;s about your next-door neighbor. It&#39;s like everybody&#39;s always throwing rocks at you, living in their own glass houses. So I thought it was commercial. I just always loved the song. When I first wrote it, I had a feeling about that song, years and years ago, because I loved that little Cajun feel. It was just in an album years ago when I first recorded it. But I just always liked it, and it just seemed to jump out, too. <br><br><b>&quot;If Only&quot; was one of the songs you wrote for the Mae West project.</b><b><br></b> Yeah. We&#39;re using Mae West&#39;s music, but there was a place for three original pieces of music. And I had written some other things for it, which I&#39;m still doing by the way. It&#39;s being rewritten, and we&#39;re still planning to do it. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Associated Press</font><br><font size="2">July 6, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton launches first tour in a decade</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Associated Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Associated Press" width="455"></div><br><br>NASHVILLE, Tenn. AP, Slivers of doubt and defiance ran through Dolly Parton as she prepared for her first tour in a decade. <br><br>The defiance was directed at radio programmers who ignore her new music. The doubt concerned how concert audiences might respond to her recent musical experimentation, including &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; the Led Zeppelin anthem she recorded with an acoustic arrangement for her new album &quot;Halos and Horns.&quot;<br> &quot;I don&#39;t want to be hit with tomatoes and eggs,&quot; she said, joking but with a tinge of seriousness. &quot;We&#39;re not going to put it in the show right away. We thought we&#39;d wait and see what the people think. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want it to be a joke. I don&#39;t want it to be like &#39;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&#39;&quot;<br> Parton, 56, need not worry. As a cultural icon dating back to the 1970s, she is certain to be warmly received when the 13-city theater tour begins Wednesday (July 10) at the Irving Plaza in New York. She also will play Chicago, New Orleans, Atlanta and the historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. She may play England and Ireland in the fall. <br><br>Looking just like Dolly Parton should in a tight skirt and blouse accentuating her famous figure, blond wig and makeup (&quot;I can look phony, but I&#39;m not phony, and that&#39;s the difference,&quot; is one of her pet one-liners), Parton made a relatively casual entrance for an interview at her Nashville office. She says she won&#39;t even let her nieces and nephews see her looking anything other than like &quot;a country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour is.&quot; <br><br>&quot;You made me have to get dressed and fixed up this morning, because all the other interviews were phoners,&quot; she teased. <br><br>She hasn&#39;t toured for so long because she&#39;s been busy elsewhere, including an acting career and her theme park, Dollywood, at the foot of the Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border. <br><br>&quot;The people pretty much got me back on tour,&quot; Parton said. &quot;With the last two albums and the success we had, we just got hundreds of calls every week trying to book us. <br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t really doing much, because I&#39;m not getting any big offers for movies and I&#39;ve got my business things all in order. <br><br>&quot;So I thought, &#39;Maybe I&#39;ll go out and see if they really do want to see me...I will be curious to see if the people like it. If they do, I&#39;ll probably continue with it.&quot; <br><br>Radio programmers cooled on new music of veteran artists like Parton in the 1990s, another reason she was less active musically. <br><br>Before that, she had a remarkable streak of hits, stretching back to duets with mentor Porter Wagoner in the 1960s. On her own, she ranged from the very country &quot;Jolene&quot; to ballads like &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and pop hits like &quot;Here You Come Again.&quot; <br><br>By 1999, Parton concluded she may as well do as she pleased with her music. So she released &quot;The Grass is Blue,&quot; which was named best album by the International Bluegrass Music Association in 2000. <br><br>Its success put Parton on a creative roll. She followed with &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; in 2001, and now &quot;Halos &amp; Horns.&quot; All three albums are on the roots-Americana Sugar Hill Records label. <br><br>Parton&#39;s sound has evolved from bluegrass to acoustic country, the kind of music she sang growing up in rural Tennessee. She&#39;s also made a habit of interpreting unlikely songs like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and Collective Soul&#39;s &quot;Shine&quot; in that style.<br> Parton&#39;s own songwriting is inspired on &quot;Halos &amp; Horns,&quot; many times exploring the conflict between spirit and flesh. On &quot;Hello God,&quot; she questions the existence of God in light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and on &quot;These Old Bones&quot; she sings two parts, that of a narrator and a clairvoyant old mountain woman. <br><br>&quot;These Old Bones&quot; runs nearly six minutes, something she&#39;d be discouraged from doing if radio play were a factor. <br><br>&quot;Now, I don&#39;t even think about the radio,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s wonderful if they would play it, and if I got lucky I wouldn&#39;t mind editing something down if it made sense...But I will not whack anything all to pieces to try and be commercial again. <br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve been doing nothing for me for a long time, and I feel I&#39;ve done as much for country music as it&#39;s done for me.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Guardian</font><br><font size="2">July 12, 2002</font><br><br><b>Oliver Burkeman asks Dolly Parton about her music, her men and her love of Led Zeppelin</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Guardian" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Guardian" width="455"></div><br><br>It&#39;s just after 10 on a muggy Saturday morning in New York, the air already hot and thick, and most of the comfortably-off, comfortably-dressed guests at the Rhiga Royal Hotel are only just beginning to surface. Not Dolly Parton, though. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m always up at 3am,&quot; she says merrily, placing herself compactly into a beige armchair in a suite of such unremitting beigeness it might have been deliberately selected to highlight her bright pink lipstick and radioactively blonde hair. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a very early person. It&#39;s my most creative time. Sometimes I get up even a little earlier,&quot; she says in a brisk twang, a curious hybrid of Tennessee drawl and east-coast fast-talk, peppering her conversation with self-deprecating asides. &quot;But I also go to bed early. Well, you know what they say - early to bed, early to rise, makes ya...stupid.&quot; She is tiny (5ft 1in) and 56 years old, but she doesn&#39;t look it. It&#39;s not that she looks younger; she just somehow doesn&#39;t seem to manifest any of the normal outward indicators used to assess age. This is disconcerting. <br><br>Parton is in New York to begin her first concert tour in 10 years, and in a way it is surprising that she is here at all. Just five years ago, she was still effectively banned from country music radio stations, rejected as a cheesy throwback in favour of &quot;new country&quot;, and it looked like Dolly Parton might be over. It wasn&#39;t that she was poor - not poor in the sense of her almost implausibly country-music upbringing as one of 12 siblings, sharing beds due to lack of space in a down-at-heel home in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, before she headed, as a penniless 16-year-old, for Nashville. (Her vast family is doing just fine now, incidentally, thanks in no small part to her success.) <br><br>But she was rich for reasons that only seemed to bolster her unreal, cartoonish image as an icon of American kitsch and some kind of popular-culture synonym for the word &quot;curvaceous&quot;. There was, for example, Dollywood, her Smoky Mountain Theme Park, which still does a roaring trade at number 1020, Dollywood Lane, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. &quot;I was lucky in that I&#39;d made some smart moves before,&quot; she says today. &quot;Because if I&#39;d been just depending on my records and my tours, I&#39;d have been up shit creek.&quot; <br><br>So Parton kept working - writing and singing. They have a saying where she comes from, she explains: &quot;A peacock who rests on his tail-feathers is just another damn turkey.&quot; Still, she felt the sting of exile. &quot;When I realised I had no outlet for the music, I reacted just like a drug addict,&quot; she says. &quot;I thought, &#39;I have to find a way to get these songs out. Even if I just record &#39;em and sell &#39;em out of the trunk of my car.&#39; Seriously. I say that as a joke, but I meant it then.&quot; <br><br>There is a second part to the classic country myth, though: the comeback. And Parton has been coming back spectacularly for three years now with a sequence of criticially acclaimed, pared-down, largely acoustic bluegrass albums. The first two, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and <i>Little Sparrow</i> both won Grammys and took some risks. <i>Little Sparrow</i>, for example, includes a bluegrass cover of Cole Porter&#39;s <i>I Get a Kick Out of You</i>. <br><br>Her new album is called <i>Halos and Horns</i> and her voice - unexpectedly, perhaps, for the singer who sang <i>Jolene</i>, <i>Nine to Five</i> and <i>I Will Always Love You</i>) - seems like it was meant all along to sail over the spare picked mandolins, clawhammer banjos and fiddles of bluegrass rather than the drums and gee-tars of what she calls &quot;hard country&quot;. <br><br>The music is mostly self-written - that&#39;s what Parton is doing at three in the morning when everyone else is asleep. There are a couple of covers, though, one of which almost caused mutiny among her musicians. &quot;I told them, and they said, &#39;My God, you&#39;re gonna try <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>?&#39; I said I&#39;m not gonna try to do it - I&#39;m doing it! People are scared to death of that song. Everybody does it on stage, but nobody records it. Why not? It&#39;s a fantastic song. I don&#39;t know what it means, but I&#39;m not even sure if the writers know what it means, because I&#39;ve asked them.&quot; She had always thought of it as a gospel song, though, perhaps with a bit of bluegrass thrown in, and when she approached Jimmy Page and Robert Plant for permission to put in a few extra lines (&quot;Oh, the great almighty dollar leaves you lonely, lost and hollow&quot;), it turned out that they did too. The idea sounds like a gimmick. The recording, on the other hand, sounds haunted and beautiful - and freighted with a subtle sadness that was never, perhaps, Led Zeppelin&#39;s strongest point. <br><br>And no, she says, Rolf Harris was not an influence. What she actually says, when I mention Rolf, is a polite: &quot;No...who?&quot; I say: &quot;Australian illustrator. Children&#39;s TV presenter. Digeridoos.&quot; &quot;Well, that shows it&#39;s a good song,&quot; she says. &quot;You can do it however you like, and as long as your heart is in it, it will work.&quot; <br><br>She actually chose the song, at least in part, because it was a favourite of her husband of 36 years, Carl Dean. Dean is among the most mysterious of music - industry spouses; he and Parton met as teenagers and he has never, as far as I can establish, made a public appearance in that time. Instead, he serves in Parton&#39;s conversation as a rhetorical manifestation of Smoky Mountain masculinity: solid and dependable, easily accepting but not easily starstruck. &quot;Carl is very proud of me, but he just wants to know I&#39;m having a good time. He&#39;s pretty much a loner, and I&#39;m the only person he wants to be with anyway. When I&#39;m gone, he loves his alone time.&quot; <br><br>What does he feel about being married to Dolly Parton, the Dolly Parton, though? &quot;Oh, when people say, &#39;How can you stand her to be out there?&#39;, he says, &#39;Look, I would think less of any man who didn&#39;t fall in love with her.&#39; That&#39;s how foolish he is.&quot; Has he ever spoken to the press? &quot;Oh my. Oh God. Are you crazy? That is never, never, never gonna happen!&quot; <br><br>The perfect marriage - but there have been plenty of rumours about Parton&#39;s personal life, linking her with a roster of Hollywood men, from James Woods to Burt Reynolds. &quot;I don&#39;t deny nor admit anything,&quot; she says, grinning. &quot;Why bother? I&#39;d rather have people think I&#39;m exciting, rather than vanilla. And if I haven&#39;t done it, I&#39;m capable of doing it. I just ain&#39;t got around to it.&quot; <br><br>Dolly Parton the singer, songwriter and some-time actor, seems to stand in a curious relationship with Dolly Parton the celebrity with the hair and the make-up and all the rest. Asked whether the move to bluegrass made her think of changing her image, she rattles off a series of jokes about how comfortable she feels looking the way she does. &quot;This is how I look, it&#39;s how I look best. There&#39;s only one Dolly. People say, &#39;How long does it take to do your hair?&#39; And I say, &#39;I don&#39;t know - I&#39;m never there.&#39; I have more important things to do.&quot; <br><br>Then again, you can&#39;t use a word or phrase in her presence - however inadvertently - that could even remotely be interpreted as a euphemism for the size of her bust without her pointing it out and coming over all Barbara Windsor. (I make the mistake of referring to her forthright response to critics of her music by using the adjective &quot;up-front&quot;. &quot;If you&#39;ll pardon the expression!&quot; she cries, victoriously.) <br><br>Delighted to expand on this subject, she says: &quot;The thing that&#39;s always worked for me is the fact that I look so totally artificial, but am so totally real. It gives me something to work against. I have to overcome myself. I have to prove how good I am.&quot; She imitates a growly redneck, addressing herself: &quot;If you&#39;re gonna look like that, you better do somethin&#39; or they&#39;re just gonna think you&#39;re a damn joke. So - you&#39;ve got to sing a better song.&quot; But, she insists, she doesn&#39;t dwell on the question, nor, for that matter, on finessing her looks. &quot;I can be ready to go in 20 minutes,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ve got it down to a gnat&#39;s ass.&quot; <br><br>Children are the ones who understand her best. &quot;They think I&#39;m like some sort of cartoon, because I look like a cartoon and my name is Dolly and my voice is small and I&#39;m a joyful little person.&quot; She plans to record childrens&#39; albums, in between the bluegrass, and running Dollywood, and launching a cosmetics brand. <br><br>Commerically, she says, things haven&#39;t been better since the heyday of her first stardom. &quot;They&#39;ve even started playing my records again on the radio - so go figure,&quot; she says. &quot;Seems you gotta get rich in order to sing like you&#39;re poor again. So now I do these songs, five, six, seven minutes long, and I&#39;m not going to edit them down. They can play them or not play them. I&#39;m not saying, &#39;Oh, kiss my ass.&#39; I&#39;d love it if they did play them. But I&#39;m OK with it if they don&#39;t.&quot; <br><br>She will never retire, she says. &quot;I&#39;m 56, but I feel just like I did when I left the Smoky Mountains. I hope to fall dead in the middle of some wonderful project that I&#39;m working on, preferably on stage or in the middle of the song I&#39;m writing.&quot; The appeal of the latter thought seems to catch her unawares. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;d love,&quot; she says, seizing the idea and elaborating. &quot;To just fall over on my guitar, dead. And have the song already done, have it on tape. Yeah. And it&#39;d be, like&quot; - her voice falls to a newsreader&#39;s respectful murmur - &quot;&#39;They found her dead, both boobs hanging over the front of her guitar, and this classic song just laying in her lap.&#39; That&#39;s how I&#39;d like to go.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Washington Post</font><br><font size="2">July 12, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton, Down From the Mountain</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Washington Post" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Washington Post" width="455"></div><br><br>COUNTRY-pop-movie-media star Dolly Parton&#39;s reconnection to the traditional mountain music of her Appalachian childhood came long before the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; phenomenon, even before the first of her three critically acclaimed &quot;bluegrass&quot; albums for Sugar Hill, the latest of which, &quot;Halos &amp; Horns,&quot; has just been released. <br><br>There was 1994&#39;s &quot;Heartsongs,&quot; an overlooked (and underpromoted) gem in which Parton teamed with the likes of Alison Krauss, Rhonda Vincent and Jerry Douglas to revisit Carter Family staples, folk standards and classic originals like &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; and &quot;My Tennessee Mountain Home.&quot; Parton even resurrected the theme song from the Cas Walker Farm and Home Hour, the Knoxville radio show where she made her debut at age 7. <br><br>More important was 1998&#39;s &quot;Hungry Again,&quot; in which she noted &quot;Sometimes to know how far you&#39;ve traveled, you&#39;ve got to go back to where you began.&quot; Which Parton did through an extended stay at the two-room log cabin where she&#39;d grown up in the Smoky Mountains. She&#39;d long ago bought the cabin and surrounding land for a private retreat, that&#39;s a replica at Dollywood, and it was there Parton was inspired to write more than three dozen songs in a very short period. Twelve of them appeared on &quot;Hungry Again,&quot; the first all-new Parton collection in many years. <br><br>&quot;I had just gone back to my roots, gone back to the Smoky Mountains, trying to figure out what I wanted to do musically with the rest of my life,&quot; Parton explains. &quot;The business end was in pretty good shape, I wasn&#39;t doing it for money anymore. I often make the joke that I had to get rich to sing like I&#39;m poor. It&#39;s not really as much of a joke as it is the truth, because I could never have made a living doing this kind of music. <br><br>&quot;But you have to look at the business end of it as well. I wasn&#39;t getting no kind of play on the radio anyhow, so it made no difference what kind of stuff I was recording at my age at that time,&quot; says the singer, who recently turned 56. &quot;That&#39;s why the album was called &#39;Hungry Again&#39;, &#39;cause I&#39;m <i>still</i> hungry and I <i>still</i> love the music. The reason that I can sing this stuff is that it&#39;s in every fiber of my body, what I call my Smoky Mountain DNA. <br><br>&quot;And people really seemed to accept it.&quot; <br><br>So much so that Parton is going on tour for the first time in 10 years. <br><br>&quot;I was very involved in a lot of other things and I wasn&#39;t really involved in a record career that would merit people coming out to see me, and I didn&#39;t know what kind of music to do,&quot; she says. &quot;And I just didn&#39;t want to keep singing over a big band. But when I got a lot of attention from the last two albums and hundreds of calls to go on the road, I didn&#39;t have a band together.&quot; <br><br>Now she does, a Tennessee-bred bluegrass band called the Blueniques. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m doing it strictly for the music. I hadn&#39;t intended to <i>ever</i> go back on the road and I&#39;m not going to really kill myself like the old days. A few shows a month, I&#39;ll see if people really want to see me.&quot; <br><br>If not, Parton&#39;s got a few fall-back positions, including, of course, Dollywood, the 17-year-old Pigeon Forge theme park whose 2.5 million visitors a year make it Tennessee&#39;s top attraction. <br><br>At Dollywood, thrill rides combine with the story of Parton&#39;s life. New this year: Smoky Mountain Wilderness Adventure, a simulation ride through the Great Smoky Mountains, and Chasing Rainbows, an exhibit of fan-generated gifts and knickknacks accumulated over 30 years.<br> &quot;The story of my life in junk and stuff,&quot; cracks Parton, admitting she never throws anything away, a trait left over from her hardscrabble upbringing. It&#39;s also why she still gets up every day at 5:30 a.m. <br><br>That will serve her well in the fall when she starts shooting a Mae West biofilm for television. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be doing a very New York accent, which is the first time I&#39;ll ever have done a character outside someone with a Southern accent,&quot; Parton says. &quot;I can do it, it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never found nothing that merited going that far.&quot; In the wake of Reba McEntire&#39;s success in &quot;Annie, Get Your Gun,&quot; there&#39;s talk underway about what would seem a golden marketing opportunity, a Broadway revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; rewritten so matchmaker Dolly Levi&#39;s from the South. <br><br>The more credible Southern connection that began with &quot;Hungry Again&quot; came to fruition on the Sugar Hill albums, 1999&#39;s &quot;The Grass Is Blue&quot; and last year&#39;s &quot;Little Sparrow.&quot; Like the new &quot;Halos &amp; Horns,&quot; they feature a delightful mix of Parton originals and revivals, traditional favorites and some surprising pop songs given mountain makeovers. The new album included Bread&#39;s &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br>&quot;One of the reasons it&#39;s working is I am picking these songs myself,&quot; Parton says. &quot;Otherwise I couldn&#39;t pull it off. If it doesn&#39;t feel right in my gut, or don&#39;t feel right in my mouth...if it&#39;s anything I chose, then I know already that there&#39;s a soul feeling for it and I have reason to do them and am brave enough to attempt them. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;d always wanted to record that song and I didn&#39;t know a way to do it,&quot; she says of the Led Zeppelin classic. &quot;People said, oh surely you&#39;re not going to do &#39;Stairway to Heaven!&#39; And I said why not? I got all these albums out so I figured I might as well get the Led out. With this new style, even though it&#39;s my old style, my original style, I can make it work. I can tweak those songs and do it in a way that they feel right coming out of me, not inventing something that&#39;s hokey or false or plastic. <br><br>&quot;Now, people have always accepted that I look artificial but they know that I&#39;m real,&quot; Parton adds. &quot;And it&#39;s the same thing with these songs.&quot; <br><br>Even better are the songs that Parton is writing, or in some cases, rewriting, or dusting off for reinvention, like &quot;What a Heartache&quot; (from 1984&#39;s ill-fated Sylvester Stallone-goes-country movie, &quot;Rhinestone&quot;) or &quot;Not for Me,&quot; a gorgeous &#39;60s love song Parton had never recorded, rediscovered in her own Dollywood archives. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t even know myself all the stuff that&#39;s back there,&quot; she says. &quot;Years ago, I&#39;d write 10, 15 songs a week. I used to say I&#39;ll never have to write another song as long as I live if I don&#39;t want to &#39;cause I&#39;ve got thousands of songs piled up and I can just go back and revisit them. But I still love to write. That&#39;s my therapy and that&#39;s my gift.&quot; <br><br>The move back to tradition has also inspired Parton&#39;s best singing in years, as if this particular music is the genre best suited to her emotions as well as her soaring soprano. <br><br>Parton agrees. <br><br>&quot;The reason I&#39;m singing better than ever now is because this comes from the gut of me, from the very depth of my soul. I feel this stuff, I see it, I&#39;ve lived it, my people have lived it. It&#39;s what I grew up knowing, it&#39;s like it&#39;s embedded in my psyche. When I start singing this kind of stuff, I open up in every part of my being, not just my mouth. I open my heart, my head and my soul.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Tennessean</font><br><font size="2">July 19, 2002</font><br><br><b>Mother to the music</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Tennessean" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Tennessean" width="455"></div><br><br>The Country Music Hall of Fame&#39;s medallion ceremony for 12 new members was humming along smoothly and elegantly, until the climax. <br><br>It was time for a stage full of new and existing Hall of Famers to sing the institution&#39;s signature song, <i>Will the Circle Be Unbroken</i>. <br><br>There was a galaxy of vocal star power onstage in the Hall&#39;s rotunda, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was ably playing the music. But as one person looked at another, it became clear that nobody had rehearsed who would step forward and actually lead the sing-a-long. <br><br>Suddenly a dazzling voice and personage materialized in front of the group and dug into the first verse with lusty passion: &quot;I was standing by my window on a cold and cloudy day &hellip;&quot; <br><br>Go figure. It was Dolly Parton, saving the moment. <br><br>&quot;It was in the wrong key for all of us. I thought &#39;Oh my Lord!&#39; I meant to sing a different verse. But no one was going to sing!&quot; Dolly said later, as she laughed and explained her impulse to keep social situations running smoothly. <br><br>&quot;Steel Magnolias, Southern women, are used to taking care of people. If we see something that ain&#39;t working, you&#39;ve got to make it work. It&#39;s just that motherly instinct I think.&quot; <br><br>Motherly? Is that what we think of when we think of Dolly, the queen of country glam? The uptown hillbilly with a voice that can cut through to your soul? The countrypolitan diva/movie star turned new bluegrass icon? <br><br>Well, face it. While Dolly never had children of her own, at 56, she&#39;s old enough to have kids with kids. And the warm embrace she&#39;s offered in recent years to traditional acoustic country music, the music on which she was reared, has placed her comfortably in the role of protector and wise woman. <br><br>With only a few isolated exceptions, the music pouring out of Dolly during this phase of her career (among the best she&#39;s ever made) has been on record: the acclaimed <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> followed by <i>Little Sparrow</i> and now the new <i>Halos and Horns</i>. <br><br>This month, she launched her first tour in about 10 years with a well-received show in New York City. The Parton caravan, which comes to Ryman Auditorium Sunday night, is a mostly acoustic romp through her recent bluegrass and folk revivalism, as well as a healthy dose of all-time hits, including her blockbusters such as <i>I Will Always Love You</i> and <i>9 to 5</i>. <br><br>But don&#39;t assume that because her music has been more down-home on her recent albums that she&#39;s going to be any less glamorous. <br><br>&quot;You ain&#39;t never going to see no down-home looking Dolly. Never!&quot; she declares. &quot;Not unless you come to my house at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning and get me up. That&#39;s half the magic. Besides, I don&#39;t think I could sing a lick if I didn&#39;t have on rhinestones.&quot; <br><br><i>Halos and Horns</i>, as both a tour and an album, had sort of an unusual birth. <br><br>&quot;This album came out of the fact that I was auditioning people for a road show,&quot; she says. <br><br>Back in her East Tennessee home, she called on some of the musicians who had been staples at her Dollywood amusement park, including banjoist and band leader Gary Davis, for extensive band auditions. At the same time, she thought she&#39;d accomplish another goal by using those sessions to make new demo recordings of her own songs, some new and some decades old. Though she&#39;d planned to go into the studio with Steve Buckingham, her regular producer, later in the year, the audition/demo sessions came to life and convinced Dolly that they were making a fine album. <br><br>&quot;To me, when a thing like this happens, it&#39;s a meant-to-be thing.&quot; <br><br>The album has only a couple of pure bluegrass tunes but several interesting experiments. She consciously takes on the role of mountain matron on <i>Old Bones</i>, in which Dolly, channeling the wizened voice of her own mother, sings a dialogue with a girl who is figuring out that the mysterious town clairvoyant is actually her own mother. <br><br>Several songs use a full gospel chorus. She calls <i>John Daniel</i> a hippie-style folk romp. And then there&#39;s the most famous and daring tune on the album, a version of the Led Zeppelin epic/warhorse <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>. It&#39;s a pretty interesting and entertaining cut that proves Dolly isn&#39;t kidding when she says she didn&#39;t mean for it to be a gimmick.<br> &quot;I thought a lot about it,&quot; she says. &quot;That song has meant a lot to me for a lot of years. And it&#39;s my husband&#39;s favorite song. That was another personal reason I did it.&quot; <br><br>She treated it like a spiritual tune, set in sequence to complement the <i>Hello God</i> and <i>Raven Dove</i>. <br><br>&quot;What this album turned out to be and what I had hoped is some of everything that I have ever been and what I am,&quot; Parton says. &quot;Because not only did I take some songs of old and rework them, I did some new songs that sounded like they were old. I love that solid hard-country sound, but it took me all the way back to my early days in Nashville. The gospel influence has always been a part of me, and I wanted to bring that in.&quot; <br><br>That very much describes the show you&#39;ll see Sunday night, not a retrospective, but a portrait of a singer who seems comfortable wearing many hats, all of them country. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">New York Times</font><br><font size="2">July 21, 2002</font><br><br><b>The Other Dolly Parton, the Songwriting One</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="New York Times" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="New York Times" width="455"></div><br><br>Mention Dolly Parton&#39;s name, and images of her blond bouffant, her hourglass figure and her glitzy wardrobe leap to the minds of most people. Some might also think of Ms. Parton&#39;s silvery soprano, her movie and television roles, even Dollywood, her theme park in the Great Smoky Mountains. Few people, though, will give much thought to what is perhaps Ms. Parton&#39;s greatest gift, her songwriting, a legacy that&#39;s long been obscured by her flashier attributes. <br><br>Ms. Parton acknowledges that she has brought some of this confusion on herself. &quot;I&#39;ve created this and played it up, the makeup, the whole persona,&quot; said Ms. Parton, dressed in a peach-colored jacket and miniskirt, at her rehearsal studio in South Nashville. &quot;I&#39;ve over-exaggerated and made things worse. But I&#39;ve had a good time doing it, and it all came from a serious place: a country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour is.&quot; <br><br>&quot;But this isn&#39;t all I am,&quot; Ms. Parton added. &quot;It&#39;s not even most of what I am. Hopefully people can see beneath the hair to know there&#39;s a brain, beneath the boobs to know there&#39;s a heart, and behind all the other stuff to know there&#39;s some talent.&quot;<br> Ms. Parton just released her 72nd album, &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; (Sugar Hill), which she produced herself. Like her last three records, it is steeped in bluegrass and reflects her mountain roots. She was born, one of 12 children, to sharecropper parents in rural eastern Tennessee. She first sang on television in Knoxville, and after appearing on the Grand Ole Opry at 13, she won over Nashville and Hollywood on her way to becoming a bona fide pop icon. <br><br>Ms. Parton has been writing about her experiences since she was a small girl. &quot;People know I write songs, but I doubt they know how serious I am about it,&quot; she said. <br><br>Since moving to Nashville in 1964, Ms. Parton, now 56, has published more than 3,000 of her compositions. Dozens have become hits, not only for her but for singers ranging from Emmylou Harris to Whitney Houston. Ms. Parton has written vivid odes to her hardscrabble childhood in Appalachia (&quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;); gripping studies in Southern gothic (&quot;Jolene&quot;); feminist anthems (&quot;9 to 5&quot;); and tender ballads (&quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;). Her catalog of original material isn&#39;t just one of the deepest and best in country music; last year, the National Academy of Popular Music deemed it impressive enough to elect Ms. Parton to its Songwriters Hall of Fame, joining the likes of Duke Ellington, Hoagy Carmichael and Bob Dylan. <br><br>&quot;Writing&#39;s just as natural to me as getting up and cooking breakfast,&quot; said Ms. Parton, who lives on a farm outside Nashville with her husband of 36 years, Carl Dean, a contractor. &quot;I ain&#39;t never far away from a pencil and paper or a tape recorder. I write every day, even when I&#39;m on a plane, in the tub or on the bus. It burns in me. Songwriting is my way of channeling my feelings and my thoughts. Not just mine, but the things I see, the people I care about. My head would explode if I didn&#39;t get some of that stuff out. Not everything I write is good, but it&#39;s all good for me, like therapy.&quot;<br>Ms. Parton wrote 12 of the 14 songs on &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; all of them arranged in the latter-day mountain style, replete with the fiddle, banjo and mandolin she used on her three previous albums. And rather than using the usual session professionals, Ms. Parton has lesser known but accomplished singers and musicians backing her this time, some of whom work at her theme park. The outcome is music that&#39;s less varnished but more suited to the range and depth of emotion that the songs on her album convey. <br><br>&quot;Sugar Hill,&quot; a title she says was taken from the name of her record label, is an idyllic remembrance of things past set to a melody that recalls the old fiddle tune &quot;Cripple Creek.&quot; &quot;If Only&quot; is a throbbing monument to regret, &quot;These Old Bones&quot; a playfully serious paean to a back-holler mystic, a character patterned after Ms. Parton&#39;s mother. Sadness suffuses at least half the tracks on the album, notably the neo-Appalachian ballads &quot;Not for Me&quot; and &quot;Dagger Through the Heart.&quot; <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s just the way of the mountains,&quot; Ms. Parton said. &quot;You grow up singing those old sad songs. You don&#39;t even think they&#39;re sad.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I was born with a joyful heart, but I&#39;m extremely sensitive,&quot; she went on. &quot;I hurt deep, and I&#39;ve hurt a lot in my life. I feel deep for everything I see.&quot; <br><br>Nowhere is this empathy, a capacity Ms. Parton attributed to her &quot;Smoky Mountain DNA,&quot; more apparent than in the two songs she wrote in response to the terrorist attacks of last September. The hymnlike &quot;Raven Dove&quot; expresses Ms. Parton&#39;s longing for a world in which peace and justice coexist. Just as prophetic is &quot;Hello God,&quot; an update of Mr. Dylan&#39;s &quot;With God on Our Side.&quot; <br><br>&quot;We fight and kill each other in your name, defending you/ Do you love some more than others?/ We&#39;re so lost and confused,&quot; sings Ms. Parton, addressing God, as a gospel quartet spurs her on to the chorus. &quot;Hello, God, are you out there? Can you hear us? Are you listening anymore?&quot; <br><br>As powerful as &quot;Raven Dove&quot; and &quot;Hello God&quot; are, two other songs on the album, neither written by Ms. Parton, are likely to attract the most attention: &quot;If,&quot; the 1971 pop hit for the soft-rock group Bread, and &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; the hard-rock anthem by Led Zeppelin. <br><br>The appearance of these hoary radio staples on Ms. Parton&#39;s album will doubtless induce groans from skeptics. (&quot;Bread Zeppelin&quot; was one writer&#39;s offhand review of the project.) Nevertheless, they bear Ms. Parton&#39;s stamp, just as her re-workings of songs written by Cole Porter and the rock band Collective Soul on her previous album, &quot;Little Sparrow,&quot; did. By picking up the tempo and adding an ebullient banjo obbligato to &quot;If,&quot; she turns a weeper into a stirring testament to human striving. By adding an ad-libbed coda to her stringboard version of &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; she transforms the song&#39;s vaguely spiritual musings into an admonition against placing one&#39;s faith in earthly treasures. <br><br>&quot;Everybody said, `Oh, you can&#39;t do that, it&#39;s a classic,&#39;&quot; Ms. Parton said, referring to &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; &quot;But I wasn&#39;t afraid to do it. I was really proud of the way it and `If&#39; turned out.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Of course, I like the other 12 songs on the record better,&quot; Ms. Parton added with a smile. &quot;You know, the ones I wrote myself.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Seattle Times</font><br><font size="2">July 21, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dollywood is a goofy, down-home good time</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Seattle Times" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Seattle Times" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE, Tenn., If Dolly Parton and her Dollywood theme park could be summed up in a single moment, it happened recently when Parton herself popped out of nowhere in one of the park&#39;s courtyards, smack in the middle of 300 stunned tourists. <br><br>Not one to be inconspicuous (her dress was the color of a solar flare), Parton seized the moment by jumping onstage with a nearby steel-drum band and launching into a Caribbean version of her hit song &quot;9 to 5.&quot; <br><br>It was surreal, particularly when Parton concluded by saying anyone who didn&#39;t enjoy the 100-acre theme park could &quot;kick my butt and I&#39;ll fix it.&quot; <br><br>Yet it was also indicative of how seriously Parton takes the park, which has evolved over 17 seasons into an intentionally goofy blend of high-tech thrill rides, Southern-themed amusements and mountain-culture tributes. <br><br>From the very start in 1986, Parton says she intended &quot;Dolly&#39;s woods&quot; to be something other than a Smoky Mountain tourist trap. It would be a preserve for traditions and culture she knew growing up on a rundown farm in nearby Locust Ridge. <br><br>What resulted is larger than life and tacky as all get-out, but also charming, fun and very unpredictable, like Parton herself. And make no mistake, this is about Dolly Parton. <br><br>If that isn&#39;t obvious on the way in, as you turn by a giant billboard of her bushy head onto a road called Dollywood Lane, it&#39;s clear in the new museum where guilty pleasures include being digitally implanted into one of eight bouffant Dolly wigs.<br> Go ahead and laugh, but last year, 2.5 million people visited Dollywood. That&#39;s more than showed up at Elvis&#39; Graceland estate or the legendary Grand Ole Opry. It&#39;s now one of the 50 most popular parks in the world. <br><br>Dolly Parton admits there are many places in the world where she doesn&#39;t fit in, but an amusement park is not one of them. Therefore, she comes to Dollywood often, including times when she sneaks in and watches live shows featuring her relatives.<br> &quot;I&#39;m like a cartoon character,&quot; says Parton, explaining why the idea of a Dollywood <br>works better than a Janefondawood or Britneyspearswood. <br><br>&quot;People don&#39;t take me as seriously as they would Jane Fonda or some of those people. I have the kind of fun, outgoing personality to pull this off, yet still have the park taken seriously and the business taken seriously.&quot; <br><br><b>And now, a Dolly museum</b><b><br></b> A $10 million addition called &quot;Adventures in Imagination&quot; recently opened, and much of it revolves around her, including a bumpy video simulator ride over the Smoky Mountains and an interactive museum based on her. <br><br>Steve Summers helped create the museum, and he was stunned to find Parton&#39;s memento collection fills 10,000 square feet of storage. Inside her &quot;attic,&quot; he found items ranging from her first royalty check for $1.02 to the costumes she wore in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas.&quot; <br><br>Hundreds of items were put on display, but Parton insisted it not be a typical museum. Quirky touches were added, like a video gimmick that superimposes fans into a prerecorded duet with Parton, and the digital cameras that fit viewers into her wigs. <br><br>Dolly Parton is 55 and looks 30. She&#39;s prettier in person than on TV, with a waist the size of a jar of pickles and hair that is big, delicate and all over the place, like a Christmas wreath. Her personality is a cross between Betty Boop and Santa. <br><br>At first sight of her, and her famous full bosom, a couple of questions come to mind. The one that&#39;s safest to ask is what on earth she needs with an amusement park. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s broke after a 40-year career that has produced 27 No. 1 songs and several hit films. <br><br>So why is she here in Pigeon Forge, back where she started? <br><br>&quot;This has been a dream a lot longer than you&#39;d think,&quot; says Parton, noting she looked 10 years before buying into the property in 1986. At that time, the site was home to a financially withering park called Silver Dollar City. <br><br>&quot;When I first started being successful, I got to thinking of things I could do to make money and things that would be good for this area. I wanted jobs for the people and jobs for my family. Word got out I was looking, and God put me and this park together.&quot; <br><br><b>It&#39;s a family affair</b><b><br></b> Today, Dollywood is the largest employer in Sevier County (2,000 at the height of the season), with a dozen of Parton&#39;s close relatives working as performers and dozens of &quot;distant&quot; relatives working in other jobs. <br><br>Beyond jobs, though, Parton was looking for a way to preserve Smoky Mountain heritage, which had been dying out since World War II. <br><br>Areas in the park were set aside for demonstrations of skills such as wagon-making, grain-milling, blacksmithing, broom-making and leathersmithing. A school was also established. Traditional mountain music is also featured, along with such homey foods as grits, sawmill gravy and fried bologna. <br><br>&quot;People who come here are really seeing deep into my heart,&quot; says Parton, noting an exception. Though the park is filled with thrill rides, including the country&#39;s highest and fastest waterfall ride, she won&#39;t ride them. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t like to get wet, and I don&#39;t like to get my makeup messed up,&quot; she says, with a grin. &quot;These shoes? These false eyelashes? That&#39;s no good.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</font><br><font size="2">July 21, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly Parton shows her roots</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Atlanta Journal-Constitution" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Atlanta Journal-Constitution" width="455"></div><br><br>Pigeon Forge, Tenn., On Sept. 11 last year, Dolly Parton was about 20 miles away from her Smoky Mountains birthplace, taping footage to be used at her theme park, Dollywood. She and her film crew were deep in the mountains. And they found it hard to get news about what was going on. Still, it was somehow fitting that on that day when the nation&#39;s faith was shaken, she was in a place that has always brought her solace. <br><br>As she sang on an early hit, &quot;In my Tennessee mountain home, / Life is as peaceful as a baby&#39;s sigh.&quot; <br><br>&quot;This is my heart-home, here in Tennessee,&quot; says Parton, wearing a &quot;yaller dress,&quot; as she calls it, and sitting upright on a plush white sofa in a Dollywood suite. &quot;This is like a place of anchor to me, where I come back to restore [myself]. I can be anywhere in the world, overseas or anything, and all I have to do is close my eyes and I can be right here. Emotionally, I&#39;m always where I need to be.&quot; <br><br>These mountains aren&#39;t a bad place for Parton to be artistically, either. Over the past two years, the flamboyant singer-songwriter has revitalized her career with a series of albums paying tribute to the bluegrass and mountain music of her home. <br><br>First, there was 1999&#39;s spirited &quot;The Grass Is Blue,&quot; which scored a Grammy Award for best bluegrass album. Then came 2000&#39;s delicate and haunting &quot;Little Sparrow,&quot; which nabbed another golden gramophone. And now there&#39;s the just-released &quot;Halos &amp; Horns,&quot; a pleasingly diverse collection of fiddle-fueled swingers (&quot;Sugar Hill&quot;), bluesy country weepers (&quot;Not for Me&quot;) and &#39;grassed-up covers of classic rockers (Bread&#39;s &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;). Yes, you read that right, Dolly Parton does &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve always loved that song,&quot; she says of the quintessential lighter-in-the-air rock power ballad. &quot;Now I&#39;m able to do a lot of songs that I couldn&#39;t before. Since ain&#39;t nobody paying my bills, I don&#39;t have to answer to no managers, no record labels and no heads of this and that, I am the head of it. I just pay for it myself, and if it does good, great. If it don&#39;t, I will have expressed myself musically.&quot; <br><br>The new album is expected to be Parton&#39;s biggest in years. She&#39;s touring for the first time in a decade. (The national jaunt lands in Atlanta, at EarthLink Live, on Thursday.) And with the success of last year&#39;s rootsy &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; soundtrack, which sold more than 5 million copies, bluegrass music has never been hotter. <br><br>&quot;We did some quick polling, and it appears as though this release is even stronger than the previous two,&quot; said Bev Paul, general manager of Sugar Hill Records, which is releasing &quot;Halos &amp; Horns&quot; as a joint venture with Parton&#39;s own Blue Eye Records. &quot;We&#39;re seeing this build going on.&quot; <br><br>The only obstacle for Parton is mainstream country music radio, which has largely abandoned the genre&#39;s core artists. The irony is that Parton was one of country&#39;s first big crossover stars, setting the groundwork for the music&#39;s current wide-ranging success. In many ways, she&#39;s now trapped in the rubble of the very walls she helped knock down. <br><br>But she remains philosophical and hopeful. &quot;I was very fortunate to have a great career long before they closed any doors on me,&quot; Parton says. &quot;After a while, you&#39;ve got to close doors on some people to open some for others. But I&#39;m not done with radio yet. They&#39;re going to have to start playing my stuff now that we&#39;re doing this bluegrass and there&#39;s such a push behind it. They&#39;ll start playing us again.&quot;<br>&quot;We judge every record on its own merits,&quot; says Dene Hallam, operations manager and program director for Atlanta&#39;s 101.5 (WKHX-FM), who hasn&#39;t yet received Parton&#39;s new single, &quot;Dagger Through the Heart.&quot; But he&#39;s suspicious of Parton&#39;s current drive to return to country radio. &quot;She conveniently forgets that she turned her back on the country industry to go to Hollywood,&quot; he says. <br><br>The singer has responded to such criticism before. In her 1994 autobiography, &quot;Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business,&quot; she wrote: &quot;I would hear some of the old-timers [in Nashville] complain that I was &#39;leaving country music.&#39; I would always reply, &#39;I&#39;m not leaving it, I&#39;m taking it with me to new places.&#39;&quot; <br><br><b>Working-class heroine</b><b><br></b> Parton was born 55 years ago in a two-room house that she has since renovated with indoor plumbing and fashioned into a getaway compound. <br><br>Despite her blond hair and light-blue eyes, Parton has a mixed heritage. &quot;My mother&#39;s people have a lot of Cherokee blood,&quot; she says. &quot;My mother&#39;s got those high cheekbones. She&#39;s dark. And several of my brothers and sisters look very Cherokee.&quot; <br><br>That type of casual race mixing among mountain folk also shaped the region&#39;s trademark sound. A young Bill Monroe, who would come to be known as the father of bluegrass music, spent a valuable apprenticeship in the 1920s with a blues-playing black guitarist from Kentucky named Arnold Schultz. <br><br>Parton&#39;s starry-eyed dreams began when she was 8 years old and her Uncle Bill gave her a guitar. On the morning after her high school graduation, she hopped on a Greyhound bus headed to Nashville. She made her first splash as the duet partner of Porter Wagoner on his celebrated TV show. But she soon began racking up a string of solo hits, such as the desperate plea to man-stealer &quot;Jolene&quot; and the self-penned &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; which Whitney Houston turned into a 4 million-selling smash in 1992. <br><br>Part of Parton&#39;s appeal has always been her forlorn soprano, which makes her sound like a heavy-hearted angel. But a large part also comes from her heavily made-up and proudly artificial image. She quickly became a sort of patron saint for working-class women who dress as boldly as possible to assert themselves in a world that would just as soon pretend they didn&#39;t exist. <br><br>Her big crossover move came in 1977, with the catchy &quot;Here You Come Again.&quot; The tune&#39;s Top 5 ranking on the pop charts set the groundwork for Parton&#39;s mainstream success, which would come to include television (two variety shows), movies (the hits &quot;9 to 5&quot; and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; and the flops &quot;Rhinestone,&quot; &quot;Straight Talk&quot; and &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;), and tabloid headlines (the most recent suggests that she&#39;s about to divorce her reclusive husband, Carl Dean). <br><br><b>No celebrity kitsch</b><b><br></b> All of those career markers, good and bad, are referenced in some way at Dollywood, the 17-year-old Smoky Mountains theme park that serves as another example of the success Parton achieves when she sticks to her roots. Dollywood, about 30 minutes from Parton&#39;s hometown of Locust Ridge, is more like a subdued national park than a kitschy, high-voltage celebrity shrine. There are no water fountains spurting from artificial bosoms, no wig-fashioned swings. <br><br>Instead, the park, which welcomes an average of 2.5 million Dolly-lovers a year, hosts a bald eagle sanctuary, craft-preservation classes (where you can learn the all-important skills of blacksmithing and lye soap making) and an annual music-filled festival of nations. This year&#39;s worldly attractions include Lithuanian folk dancers, Trinidadian harpists and Kenyan acrobats. The only nod to Parton is that all the foreign music acts must be versed in her hit &quot;9 to 5.&quot; <br><br>Dollywood&#39;s most Parton-oriented attraction is the newly opened &quot;Chasing Rainbows,&quot; an interactive museum of career-spanning memorabilia. As one walks through the halls, there are photographs of the singer with various other celebrities: Cher, Oprah Winfrey, Burt Reynolds, Naomi Campbell, Captain Kangaroo. One image seems especially dated. It&#39;s a poster of Parton in an ad for country radio. <br><br>The rest of the Parton paraphernalia ranges from the must-see (fascinating personal calendars, dating from the 1960s, that chronicle award-show appearances, movie shoots, scheduled time with hubby and even dental appointments) to things you really wish you hadn&#39;t seen (a cellulite-removing machine). There&#39;s a fun computerized feature where you can place your mug under one of Parton&#39;s towering artificial coifs. And an alcove shrine to &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; where Parton&#39;s version of the tune plays on endless repeat. <br><br>But the museum&#39;s highlight, by far, is the original multihued childhood frock that inspired Parton&#39;s hit &quot;Coat of Many Colors.&quot; In the song, she sings about how her mother lovingly crafted the coat from scraps. You expect some garish, shabby-looking mess, but it&#39;s actually rather smart, with its colorful mixture of corduroy patches in beige, red, blue and brown. Imagine something from a children&#39;s line by designer Todd Oldham. <br><br>One bit from the song goes, &quot;One is only poor . . . if they choose to be.&quot; And those words ring especially true in Parton&#39;s high-altitude environs. After all, these humble mountains have provided her with many riches. Or, as she puts it, &quot;Home is where I hang my dreams.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Times-Picayune</font><br><font size="2">July 26, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>HER ROOTS ARE SHOWING</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Dolly Parton&#39;s latest CD stays true to her mountain heritage, but with today&#39;s renewed interest in roots music, she&#39;s hip again NEW, AGAIN</b></font><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Times-Picayune" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Times-Picayune" width="455"></div></div><br>Hurricane Dolly&#39;s impact is diminished only slightly over the phone. <br><br>Calling from her Nashville office at 8:30 a.m. recently, the effervescent Dolly Parton had already dispatched two previous interviewers and would soon head off to rehearsals for her first full-blown tour in 10 years. <br><br>Though she&#39;s been off the road for the past decade, she hasn&#39;t been idle. Over a remarkable career, she has released 70-odd albums and published hundreds of her own compositions en route to becoming country music&#39;s most recognizable icon. She has starred in scores of films and television specials. Her Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., attracts more than 2 million visitors annually. She recently closed a deal to open another of her Dixie Stampede dinner show restaurants in Orlando. <br><br>No mere figurehead, she takes an active role in all of her enterprises. Working 9 to 5? She&#39;s more 5 to 9, as in 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m an early riser,&quot; said Parton, 56. &quot;Something just gets me up, because I find my best ideas in the morning. I think of God as a farmer. It&#39;s like he&#39;s up in the morning throwing out all these ideas, like a farmer throwing out corn to the chickens. Whoever&#39;s up early is the early bird getting the worm. I like to get up when everybody else&#39;s energy is asleep and the world is a little calmer.&quot; <br><br>Though she performed last New Year&#39;s Eve at Opryland and occasionally appears at Dollywood, several factors kept her off the road in the 1990s. Her myriad business interests demanded her attention, and with country radio ignoring her, she figured her audience had dried up. <br><br>&quot;If you don&#39;t have a hit record, you usually ain&#39;t gonna draw a crowd,&quot; she said. &quot;I wasn&#39;t in demand as an artist at that time. I was paying a couple million dollars a year to keep a band on salary full time, and if you&#39;re not working that much, that&#39;s a lot of money. <br><br>&quot;So I figured I&#39;d wait and do some other stuff. I never thought about going back on the road. I didn&#39;t think anybody was going to be interested in ever seeing me to that extent again.&quot; <br><br>All that changed when Parton rediscovered her roots and audiences rediscovered one of the most remarkable voices in all of popular music, let alone country. Since 1994, Parton has largely returned to the traditional instruments of the bluegrass and mountain music of her childhood, acoustic guitars, banjos, fiddles, mandolins, stand-up bass, understated drums, and to writing more traditional story-songs. Renewed respect, a fresh audience and some of the strongest reviews of her career have followed. <br><br>&quot;That music is well-suited to my voice, it&#39;s what I sing best because I love it best, and it&#39;s embedded in every fiber of my being,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s exciting to me now that it&#39;s opened up all this stuff, to where I have a reason to write these kinds of songs, which I write better than I do anything else. It&#39;s really been fun that people love this.&quot; <br><br>Her new &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; CD, the latest joint venture between her own Blue Eye imprint and Sugar Hill Records, continues her winning streak. Parton even decided to support it with a string of one-nighters, including a sold-out show at the House of Blues on Monday. She&#39;ll tour the United States through August, then head overseas for a brief European run in October. If she&#39;s still enjoying it, she might sign on for even more dates.<br> &quot;People were buggin&#39; me to death (to tour), because these last two albums have done so well,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I thought, &lsquo;Well, if they want to see me, the least I can do is put together a show and go out there.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Sets will draw on material from throughout her career, alternating &quot;My Tennessee Mountain Home,&quot; &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; and other Parton standards with more recent fare. But even the old favorites will be rendered in the stripped-down, acoustic style of her latest records. <br><br>&quot;This isn&#39;t a big production,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t have videos, I don&#39;t have big, spectacular lighting. It&#39;s going to pretty much just be me, singing and talking. You know me, I&#39;m too full of fun to just go out and sing. It&#39;ll hopefully be fun and entertaining, in addition to having those great moments with great music that&#39;s really heartfelt. Hopefully it&#39;ll be a good mixture.&quot; <br><br>Back to her roots <br><br>Dolly Rebecca Parton was born in 1946 in a Tennessee log cabin with no electricity or indoor plumbing, the fourth of 12 children. Her striking voice developed early, as did her famous physique. By 10, she was singing on local radio broadcasts. At 13, she cut her first single, &quot;Puppy Love&quot; backed with &quot;Girl Left Lonely,&quot; for the Lake Charles-based Goldband Records. It didn&#39;t make much headway; neither did a 1962 single for Mercury Records. <br><br>Undeterred, Parton announced at her 1964 high school graduation that she intended to move to Nashville and become a star. She moved the day after graduation, but stardom didn&#39;t find her right away. It wasn&#39;t until country star Porter Wagoner tapped Parton to be the female sidekick on his syndicated TV show in 1967 that she blossomed. The spotlight loved her, and vice versa. The hits started coming, first as duets with Wagoner, then with her own singles.<br> &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; a song about the patchwork jacket her mother once sewed for her, charted in 1972. In 1974 her composition &quot;Jolene&quot; went to No. 1; soon after she left Wagoner&#39;s show to set out on her own. As a farewell, she wrote &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; which became a No. 1 single for Parton in 1974 and an even bigger smash for Whitney Houston 18 years later. <br><br>In 1980, Parton made the leap to the silver screen with &quot;9 to 5,&quot; co-starring Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda; she also wrote the movie&#39;s theme song. Her recordings began to veer deeper into country-pop territory, as evidenced by her hit 1983 duet with Kenny Rogers, &quot;Islands In the Stream.&quot; <br><br>Throughout the 1980s, Parton suffered personal setbacks that included a health scare and a bout with depression and severe weight loss. But she prevailed, and in recent years has found renewed inspiration in the music of her youth. <br><br>On 1994&#39;s &quot;Heartsongs&quot;, which she originally intended to title &quot;Songs My Mama Taught Me&quot;, and the subsequent &quot;Hungry Again,&quot; &quot;The Grass Is Blue,&quot; &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; CDs, she makes old-time mountain music. Her voice, occasionally quivering with subtle trills, can be both haunted and haunting, as if it only just recently came down from the mountain. <br><br>Parton still lives in the same swath of the Smoky Mountains where she was born, and still writes about the characters who inhabit those hollers and hills. Her 1970 hit &quot;Joshua&quot; told the story of a mountain hermit. Thirty-two years later, on &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; Parton sings in the voice of an old clairvoyant mountain woman and her long-lost daughter on &quot;These Old Bones.&quot; <br><br>&quot;What I&#39;m doing now . . . I am a simple, ordinary, country person who grew up in the mountains,&quot; she said. &quot;This kind of music and this style of song is embedded in my Smoky Mountains DNA. It&#39;s so natural and so real for me that I guess people just can sense or hear or feel when something&#39;s real, even if it looks different.&quot; <br><br>Last year&#39;s &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack introduced millions of new fans to traditional Americana music. Parton is a fan of the soundtrack and was impressed that producer T Bone Burnett unearthed several vintage mountain music recordings by the original artists. But, she notes, she was making traditional albums well before &quot;O Brother.&quot; <br><br>&quot;The movie exposed an audience that we never would have gotten otherwise, but we were on that track, thinking that people were longing to hear simple music,&quot; she said. &quot;People long for realism and some honesty. That&#39;s why they love cowboys and Western movies. It ties them back to the earth. You don&#39;t just want to be out there in space; you want to touch the ground. I think this music lets you go back and not forget that we have to be anchored in some way.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s celebrity and garish image sometimes get in the way of the songs. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve made it hard on myself looking the way I look and loving the music like I do,&quot; she said. &quot;At first glance, people look at me as just hair and tits and a big mouth. Well, I know that, and I am that. But I am so much more than that. <br><br>&quot;I think that&#39;s why I&#39;ve lasted. I look artificial, but people realize that I am totally real. I&#39;ve had to overcome my image, I&#39;ve had to overcome my personality, yet by the same token, those things have made me all that I&#39;ve become.&quot; <br><br>And won her an unusual cross-section of fans, especially for a country singer. Tickets for Parton&#39;s show at the House of Blues went on sale the same day as tickets for Cher&#39;s upcoming Aug. 18 concert at the New Orleans Arena. Both Cher and Parton boast large and loyal followings among gay men; both are favorites among drag performers. <br><br>&quot;They do love us,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I think that gay people know I totally accept and love everybody as they are. Plus, I look like a drag queen. I&#39;ve been fun for a lot of gay guys that love to dress up. And I think they love the fact that I accept who I am, even if I&#39;m bizarre. It&#39;s OK to be who you are and what you are, whether you&#39;re gay or straight or green or purple or bizarre, like me. I think more than anything they relate to the fun, and that I enjoy my own self.&quot; <br><br>Heart in the right place Sometimes too much so. The &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; couplet in the title of her new album gets to the root of human nature as Parton sees it, especially her own. <br><br>&quot;Ain&#39;t we all that, though? I&#39;ve always said that I&#39;m too good to be bad and too bad to be good. My heart is good, but I can&#39;t keep from getting myself in trouble. But so what? That&#39;s who we are. We want to be good, whether we always are or not. We stumble and we slide and we make our mistakes and then we ask for forgiveness and then we&#39;re good for a while, then before you know it we&#39;re back to doing stuff that we don&#39;t have any business doing. But that&#39;s because we&#39;re passionate, living people.&quot; <br><br>Her devilment includes flirtatious banter with David Letterman and other talk show hosts, and making young country star Brad Paisley squirm when she presented an award with him at the 2001 Grammys. Her saucy, unscripted comments, including &quot;I&#39;m old enough to be your. . . . lover,&quot; made Paisley blush visibly. <br><br>Parton whoops when reminded of the encounter. <br><br>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just full of the devil,&quot; she said. &quot;But not evil, just fun. I just have this joyful devil, I call it. Love to do things for the reaction, just to shock people. And it&#39;s fun for me. I never know what&#39;s going to come out of me. Sometimes I want to smack my own mouth: &lsquo;Oh my God, did you say that?&#39; <br><br>&quot;My daddy always used to tell me, &lsquo;It&#39;s better to choose what you say than to say what you choose.&#39; I know that&#39;s good advice, but I just never could seem to follow it. Sometimes it&#39;ll just jump right out, and that&#39;s bad.&quot; <br><br>Her husband, Carl Dean, is accustomed to it. <br><br>&quot;My husband thinks I&#39;m hysterical. He don&#39;t find much fault with me, bless his heart, and I don&#39;t with him. We&#39;ve been together 38 years, we&#39;ve been married for 36, his first marriage and mine. He thinks I&#39;m fine just like I am. He doesn&#39;t try to change me. Wouldn&#39;t do him any good anyway.&quot; <br><br>Songs still hold true <br><br>Fun aside, Parton often addresses somber subjects. &quot;Raven Dove,&quot; like &quot;Hello God&quot; and &quot;Color Me America,&quot; a song that didn&#39;t make the final version of &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; were inspired by post-Sept. 11 emotional fallout. <br><br>&quot;I was more frightened at how frightened people were, and how fragile we all seemed to be. I realized that anything can change in the blink of an eye, and I thought, &lsquo;Man, we just want to run right to God.&#39; It&#39;s like you don&#39;t pay much attention to Him until something really bad happens, like a kid getting in trouble. Your parents keep telling you not to do it, and then the first thing you do once you&#39;re in big trouble is you go right to your parents. It&#39;s like we didn&#39;t realize something bad could happen to us. <br><br>&quot;(The songs) were from the heaviness of my heart and of knowing all these things from growing up in the Bible. But I was surprised by (&lsquo;Raven Dove&#39;). It&#39;s an unusual melody for me. But it just came. That&#39;s the good thing about being a writer &mdash; you write what you&#39;re given.&quot; <br><br>While auditioning musicians &quot;from up home&quot; for her band, she asked them to play some of her older songs. Hearing them again, she realized that some warranted a second chance, such as &quot;What a Heartache,&quot; which was lost on the &quot;Rhinestone&quot; album, the soundtrack to the failed 1984 movie of the same name. <br><br>&quot;Some of the best songs I ever wrote was in that soundtrack album, and people never even heard &lsquo;em,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I thought that song deserved a better shot. Same with &lsquo;Shattered Image.&#39; That was on one of my very first albums in the late &lsquo;60s. I thought it deserved another shot. That&#39;s the good thing about being a writer and trusting your own instincts. I just do what feels right in my gut in hopes that people will accept it.&quot; <br><br>Even her earliest compositions still hold up. <br><br>&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got a lot of stuff that sucks,&quot; Parton said. &quot;Any time you write that much . . . I&#39;ve got stuff that&#39;s junk. But then I&#39;ve got stuff that you know when you&#39;re doing that it&#39;s going to be OK.&quot; <br><br>Though she is an incredibly prolific writer, she still enjoys recording other artists&#39; songs. She and her husband were fans of &quot;Shine&quot; by the modern rock band Collective Soul long before she recorded it on &quot;Little Sparrow.&quot; On &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; she remakes the soft-rock group Bread&#39;s hit &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br>&quot;A lot of the off-the-wall things are stuff that I&#39;ve heard my husband play or that we&#39;ve loved together, based on his taste in music,&quot; she said. &quot;He loves hard rock, hard bluegrass and big band music. &lsquo;If&#39; was one of our love songs through the years. And he&#39;s a Led-head from Day 1. &lsquo;Stairway&#39; was always classic in his mind. I thought it would be a wonderful thing to do.&quot; <br><br>Parton interpreted &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; to be about a woman who believes she can buy her way into the promised land. To emphasize that interpretation, she added an extra verse with lines such as, &quot;the great almighty dollar leaves you lonely, lost and hollow.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I loved that song, so I wanted to make it more what I thought it was about,&quot; she said. &quot;You never really know what those abstract songs are about. They mean to me what they do. <br><br>&quot;I thought &lsquo;Shine&#39; was a spiritual song, a gospel song, and that&#39;s how I thought I would handle it. To me, that&#39;s what it says: &lsquo;Heaven let your light shine down.&#39; Like God, just look down on me and help me and teach me how to share. I think that song pretty much says what it is.&quot; <br><br>So, too, does Dolly. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a very ordinary, simple person, a country, down-home person,&quot; she said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to look as simple as I am. That would be God-awful. People say to me, &lsquo;Now that you are doing this kind of (traditional) music, are you going to tone down your look?&#39; I say, &lsquo;Hell, no.&#39;<br> &quot;I can look like a whore, but I can sing like an angel. That&#39;s where the &lsquo;Halos and Horns&#39; comes from.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Dallas Morning News</font><br><font size="2">July 27, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly reigns from bluegrass to Led Zeppelin</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Dallas Morning News" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Dallas Morning News" width="455"></div><br><br>Country music legend Dolly Parton is a fearless artist. For more than 35 years, she has tackled everything from old-timey country to its contemporary counterpart. She&#39;s gone pop, done movies, tried disco and even veered into bluegrass for a pair of critically acclaimed albums. But the queen of big hair, high heels and shiny sequins does have her limit. When asked whether she will perform her gospel-tinged cover of Led Zeppelin&#39;s rock classic &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; during her current tour, you can hear the reluctant quiver in her mountain voice. <br><br>&quot;Oh, no, not now,&quot; she says from Nashville. &quot;I want to know what they think about it first. If they don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t want people to throw tomatoes at me. I don&#39;t want to ruin my stage clothes.&quot; <br><br>Fat chance that&#39;ll happen. The pride of Sevier County, Tenn., remains one of the most loved and respected country artists. Which makes her artistic and commercial comeback extra sweet. She&#39;s on a roll: The just-released <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> is her third stunning album in three years. It follows 1999&#39;s Grammy-winning <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and its 2001 follow-up, <i>Little Sparrow</i>. <br><br>With each album, Ms. Parton has upped the ante. Each successive record is better than the last. And each new one has sold better than its predecessor. <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> recently entered Billboard&#39;s country albums chart at No. 4 and the pop list at No. 58, positions that reflect her best sales numbers in seven years.<br> So earlier this month Ms. Parton embarked on her first full-fledged tour in a decade. She&#39;s headlining a mere 13 shows in intimate auditoriums, clubs and theaters in cities such as Nashville, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Boston and Dallas. Her performance Saturday night at the Granada Theater, which is sold out, is her sole Texas date.<br> But in her typically casual manner, she downplays the long break from the concert circuit. <br><br>&quot;We just get thousands of calls a day, &#39;When are you going on tour?&#39; And I thought, &#39;You know what? If people really want to see me, I think I will see if I like it again.&#39; I wasn&#39;t really doing much, because I&#39;m not getting any big offers for movies and I&#39;ve got my business things all in order. I will be curious to see if people like it.&quot; <br><br>If the critical response to <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> is any indication, her tour will be an artful triumph. The album, her first self-produced effort, is a country masterpiece. In the space of 14 songs, Ms. Parton comes home again to the mountain music that shaped her. The record is bluegrass-tinged, but it&#39;s not a complete bluegrass opus like <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and <i>Little Sparrow</i>. <br><br>&quot;I thought it was meant for me to capture everything that I&#39;ve ever been,&quot; says the 56-year-old singer-songwriter. <br><br>&quot;Some of those songs really sound like old-time real country. I didn&#39;t want to get pigeonholed into bluegrass. As long as I kept it real I felt people would accept it. I&#39;m really not a bluegrass singer. I love bluegrass and I grew up surrounded with it, but my music was more country and more mountain. I was going for a true bluegrass album with <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>. But I didn&#39;t want to mislead people into thinking I was going totally into bluegrass music.&quot; <br><br>And yet, Ms. Parton credits the bluegrass genre with re-energizing her career. That would make her part of the bluegrass resurgence that began with Alison Krauss&#39; 2-million-selling 1995 album, <i>Now That I&#39;ve Found You: A Collection</i> and continues strong thanks to the 6-million-selling success of the <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> soundtrack. <br><br>&quot;This is my Smoky Mountain DNA,&quot; she exclaims. &quot;It&#39;s just opened me up as a writer. I&#39;ve been at this so long, and I felt my recording career was over until I did the bluegrass albums. I just did them for fun. But I saw the reaction to singing those real songs. It&#39;s about the realism.&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s also about staying viable in a youth-driven market that no longer appreciates its aging trailblazers. Ms. Parton isn&#39;t about to make disposable pop-country for the masses to compete with model-perfect hit-makers of the day such as Faith Hill, Cyndi Thomson, Jo Dee Messina and Kellie Coffey. But she, along with fellow country queens Emmylou Harris and Reba McEntire, is looking and sounding better today than during her mainstream reign. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s given me great hope for the future as an older artist,&quot; she says. &quot;Because I still feel like I&#39;m just starting. I don&#39;t ever want to retire.&quot; <br><br>Few country artists, few pop artists, for that matter, have had as illustrious and varied a career as Dolly Rebecca Parton. Soon after graduating from Sevier County High School in 1964, the ambitious and vivacious blonde trekked to Nashville in search of country music stardom. She signed her first recording contract with Monument Records in 1966; her debut album, <i>Hello, I&#39;m Dolly</i>, was released in 1967. <br><br>That same year, she scored her first two hit country singles, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot; and &quot;Something Fishy.&quot; But it was with RCA Records, where early duet partner Porter Wagoner was making music, that Ms. Parton wrote and recorded her timeless tunes. Songs such as &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; &quot;Jolene,&quot; &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;The Bargain Store&quot; quickly established her as a country artist with an honest, almost poetic style for painting pictures about the hardships and joys of being raised poor in the heartland. <br><br>Through the years, Ms. Parton&#39;s career would take as many twists and turns as the curls in her trademark wigs. She enjoyed pop crossover renown with staples such as &quot;Here You Come Again,&quot; &quot;Two Doors Down,&quot; &quot;9 to 5&quot; and &quot;Islands in the Stream,&quot; a duet with Kenny Rogers. Ms. Parton made her movie debut with 1980&#39;s <i>9 to 5</i>, which also starred Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. <br><br>Five years later, Ms. Parton, also a shrewd businesswoman, opened the Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. <br><br>In the late &#39;80s and early &#39;90s, with contemporary country albums such as <i>White Limozeen</i>, <i>Eagle When She Flies</i> and <i>Slow Dancing With the Moon</i>, Ms. Parton&#39;s recording career rebounded commercially after a few dry years. <br><br>But it wasn&#39;t until the release of <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> in 1999 that she re-emerged artistically refreshed. <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> is quintessential Dolly Parton, an album of songs that showcase the passionate singer, the consummate storyteller and the thoughtful interpreter. Horns includes two covers, a bluegrass revamping of Bread&#39;s &#39;70s pop ballad &quot;If&quot; and the talked-about rendition of Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br>Ms. Parton turned it into a powerful, six-minute Southern gospel tune, going so far as to write extra lyrics for Jimmy Page and Robert Plant&#39;s rock standard. <br><br>&quot;I love the song, and my husband [Carl Dean] loves Led Zeppelin,&quot; she says. &quot;I wondered if there was some way I could do it. I wrote a few little ad lib lines to make it more like it was about working to get to heaven, to make it lend itself more to gospel. I put a lot of heart and thought and soul and my own feeling in it. It&#39;s so Led Zeppelin, such a classic. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s such a wonderful song and everybody said, &#39;You can&#39;t be serious about doing that.&#39; <br><br>&quot;I said, &#39;Why not?&#39;&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">USA Today</font><br><font size="2">July 30, 2002</font><br><br><b>Dolly rocks, and rolls out her first tour in 10 years</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="USA Today" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="USA Today" width="455"></div><br><br>Of course Dolly Parton knew that singing <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> would shock folks. That&#39;s one of the reasons she recorded it. <br><br>&quot;I did it for the reaction,&quot; says the 56-year-old country singer, who recorded the hoary Led Zeppelin classic-rock epic for her new album, <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>. &quot;Everybody&#39;s scared to death to do it, and at my age, I thought, &#39;Well, why not?&#39; If I had just really sucked, I would&#39;ve left it off the CD.&quot; <br><br><i>Stairway to Heaven</i> isn&#39;t the first rock song that Parton has done bluegrass-style. Earlier this year, the singer collected her seventh Grammy Award, thanks to an acoustic cover of Collective Soul&#39;s <i>Shine</i>. Parton adds that Carl Dean, her reclusive husband of 36 years, likes to hear her work her mountain magic on rock songs.<br> &quot;He loves rock and bluegrass,&quot; she says. &quot;He doesn&#39;t really like much in between. He&#39;s always loved Lester Flatt and Led Zeppelin. You wouldn&#39;t believe the stuff I hear in that house.&quot; <br><br>Parton will spend more time than usual out of the house this summer: She kicked off her first tour in 10 years July 10 in New York. Next, she&#39;ll head to Dallas, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.<br> Backed by an acoustic group of musicians, Parton relies heavily on music from <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> and the two previous bluegrass albums (though likely not <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>) in her set. &quot;We&#39;re going to do medleys of all the big hits that people like, but done our way,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#39;ll do things like <i>Jolene</i>. We do <i>9 to 5</i>. It lends itself so well to the mountain (arrangement).&quot; <br><br>One song from <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> that Parton hasn&#39;t yet figured out how to stage is <i>These Old Bones</i>, a gothic tale of a young woman and an aged Appalachian soothsayer. Parton sings in the voices of both characters: For the clairvoyant&#39;s voice, she assumes a creaky, nasal tone that she says imitates her mother. <br><br>&quot;All my brothers and sisters say I&#39;m so much like mama that it&#39;s scary,&quot; Parton says. &quot;And my mama, she sounds like that. She&#39;s not in great health right now, or I would&#39;ve asked her to have done it.&quot; <br><br>Parton also identifies with the old woman in the song. &quot;I am very psychic myself, to the point of where that&#39;s how I know all these crazy things I write about,&quot; she says. &quot;These old crazy women, it&#39;s just about people like us, like my mother. If I hadn&#39;t have got out, being the way that I am, I would&#39;ve been considered one of those crazy old loons in the mountains, just because I was different and because I would&#39;ve had my nose in everybody&#39;s business.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Music Today</font><br><font size="2">July 2002</font><br><b><br>Old Treasures, New Voices, Borrowed Hearts and Blue Memories</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Music Today" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Music Today" width="455"></div><br><br>For Dolly Parton, putting together her latest album seems to have been a little like keeping the wedding tradition of presenting &quot;something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.&quot; The resplendent <i>Halos And Horns</i> has all of these things and much more, and will, no doubt, stand as one of the best albums she&#39;s ever made in her nearly 40-year career. But this marvelous musical marriage of classic country, bluegrass, and yes, even rock &#39;n&#39; roll, didn&#39;t come without some typical pre-wedding jitters. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve been so nervous about what people were gonna think. We didn&#39;t use the [musicians] we&#39;ve used on the last two,&quot; Dolly says. In the process of auditioning musicians for her upcoming tour and preparing demos to record, she soon realized that the results were sounding CD-ready. The collection, like Dolly&#39;s fabled &quot;coat of many colors&quot; that inspired one of her most-beloved hits, is a tapestry reflective of the many sides Dolly has shown in her various musical incarnations through the years. <br><br>For &quot;something old,&quot; Dolly fans need look no further than the album&#39;s title track, and the mournful &quot;Dagger through the Heart.&quot; <br><br>&quot;To me that went all the way back to my very early country days and those great solid country hits that we were having back then,&quot; she says. Dolly also dusted off a tune she wrote before she ever left her home in the Smoky Mountains. &quot;Not for Me&quot; could be the saddest song you&#39;ll hear all year. <br><br>&quot;When I found &#39;Not for Me,&#39; I was actually looking through a tape to find something they wanted to use at the new addition to the museum at Dollywood. I was just flipping around on a cassette, and I thought, &#39;What is that?&#39; I was playing guitar on it, and it was real serious and good, before I had all these nails. That was some good guitar work on that little tape! I didn&#39;t change a word, and didn&#39;t change the melody at all.&quot; <br><br>Another &quot;old&quot; tune she resurrected is &quot;Shattered Image,&quot; a song she recorded on the 1976 album, <i>All I Can Do</i>, as a result of the gossip she endured when she first came to town. <br><br>&quot;When I first wrote it many years ago, I was new in town. I was the girl with the big tits, and the big hair and the big makeup. People weren&#39;t taking me seriously and just thought I was Porter [Wagoner]&#39;s whore or something. And that really hurt me, because these people don&#39;t know me. They don&#39;t know who I am and they&#39;re accusing me of shit. They don&#39;t have any idea what they&#39;re saying. That&#39;s when I wrote the song. I can joke and laugh, and get some of my best jokes from the tabloids, but no matter what it always hurts you. If you&#39;re a sensitive person and you read stuff, you think, my goodness, why would they...should I sue them? No, that&#39;s just a waste of time and energy. But some stuff that&#39;s been out recently that was embarrassing to me and my family that was all junk, made me think of that song.&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s a subject that obviously still stings to this day, but one she rises above with typical humor, grace and dignity.<br><br>&quot;I felt like that then, and I feel like that now. &#39;If you live in a glass house, don&#39;t throw stones.&#39; &#39;Stay out of my closet if your own&#39;s full of trash&#39;...or &#39;come out of your closet and kiss my ass.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Among the &quot;new&quot; things Dolly offers is a tune that calls upon the spirit of her very-much-still-alive mother to give voice to what has already become one of the album&#39;s most talked-about tracks. &quot;These Old Bones,&quot; a song that came to Dolly in a dream, is the story of an old mountain woman with psychic abilities, reunited with a daughter taken from her as a child. And though most listeners will not have a hard time recognizing the old woman&#39;s craggy voice as Dolly&#39;s own, she says her family has heard her put on the voice for years, imitating her mother. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s exactly the way my mother sounds,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I do it for fun, for my brothers and sisters and my nieces and nephews, and they just roll! The song just came to me, this story, and I was in the middle of it, and I wasn&#39;t thinking about doing it with the old woman&#39;s voice, I was just sitting there writing, and I just started doing it, [sings in the old woman&#39;s voice], &#39;These old bones will tell you...&#39; I thought, &#39;Oh my god, this is great! I can do the old woman and I can sing with her as the daughter, and it&#39;ll be like me and Mama!&#39;&quot; <br><br>Although she had no problem &quot;channeling Mama&quot; Dolly recalls that recreating the voice in the studio was a bit more of a challenge. <br><br>&quot;I got really into it. I took it really seriously in the studio. I said to the engineer, &#39;Just think of it as I&#39;m playing a part. Just turn the lights down and let me do it, and it&#39;s not to be laughed at. I&#39;m dead serious about this.&#39; But it was tricky for me to record, I said, &#39;Turn the lights down. I don&#39;t want you looking at me, because I&#39;ve got to become the old woman.&#39; I did her part [separately], then I did mine, because I wanted to really get into her. That was some fine acting!&quot; Dolly does admit that the experiment, thought successful was &quot;really pretty bizarre. If my mother had been dead, it would have bothered me. But now that I&#39;ve already introduced it while Mama&#39;s still alive and healthy, I can always do it.&quot; She&#39;s already written new songs with the character in mind, and may include one song incorporating her on each of her albums from now on. <br><br>Setting the pattern with her last two records of refashioning rock &#39;n&#39; roll songs in true Dolly style, she &quot;borrows&quot; what is quite possibly the most famous rock song of all time, Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; and turns it into a sweeping gospel anthem. <br><br>&quot;I love that song, and that melody&#39;s so beautiful for my voice,&quot; she says. &quot;It lends itself to those three-part harmonies I love to do with myself.&quot; <br><br>Although she agrees that even the song&#39;s writers probably don&#39;t exactly know the song&#39;s true meaning, Dolly offers her take on it. <br><br>&quot;I always thought it had something to do with God. But I had heard, a long time ago when they wrote it, that it was about the Queen of England. &#39;There&#39;s a lady who&#39;s sure all that glitters is gold...&#39; [It reflects] the attitude the English had about the Queen. &quot;If there&#39;s a bustle in your hedgerow, don&#39;t be alarmed/It&#39;s just a spring clean for the May Queen.&#39; Well, all those fences are made out of hedges, and they trim and clean all that stuff up for the big May Day stuff that&#39;s sponsored by the Queen. But, I also thought &#39;If there&#39;s a bustle in your hedgerow&#39; means if there&#39;s a problem in your head, don&#39;t be alarmed. God&#39;s just trying to clean some stuff up. So to me it had two or three meanings. I didn&#39;t know what it really was about, except that I felt a spiritual thing about someone that believed in something more than money, something greater than we are.&quot; <br><br>Although she wasn&#39;t aware of the satanic reference that&#39;s supposedly revealed when the song is played on a turntable in reverse, when pointed out to her, Dolly quips, &quot;I certainly fixed that! I exorcised that song, I put God all over it!&quot; The song&#39;s writers, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, after hearing her version, gave Dolly their seal of approval. <br><br>&quot;We didn&#39;t hear back fora long time and I was real scared they were not gonna let me do it!&#39;&quot; she recalls. &quot;Then later we got the message back that they liked it. They&#39;d been out of town, and they just hadn&#39;t heard it. Robert Plant was really thrilled that I used the choir because he said when he wrote it he always thought of it as a gospel...a spiritual song. So he was thrilled that I&#39;d used the choir. I was really nervous. You would be, that&#39;s the classic of all time. It came from a spiritual place in my heart and in my head, and I performed it in a great spirit when I recorded it. I was in a &#39;God&#39; place.&quot; <br><br>Dolly was also in that &quot;God place&quot; when she resurrected another song she&#39;s &quot;carried around&quot; for more than three decades. &quot;John Daniel&quot; is a clap-your-hands-and-raise-the-roof gospel number featuring Dollywood&#39;s resident gospel quartet, the Kingdom Heirs. <br><br>Though she didn&#39;t venture far from home to put this album together, Dolly is headed out on her first full-fledged concert tour in years. While mid- to late-summer shows will focus on songs from her three most recent albums, shows later in the year and thereafter will likely incorporate more of the songs that fans would expect at a career-spanning Dolly show. And even though she&#39;s covered Led Zeppelin, don&#39;t expect an elaborate spectacle of lights and lasers. Befitting the acoustic nature of these songs, Dolly vows to &quot;keep it simple.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s also keeping a body count. Aware that she&#39;s written and recorded her fair share of songs, that end in the death of one or more main characters, Dolly&#39;s been debating which downbeat songs to include, and which to leave out. <br><br>&quot;If I do &#39;Mountain Angel,&#39; she says, &quot;I&#39;ve got one dead baby. How many babies can I kill in one show? I was thinking about doing &#39;Me and Little Andy,&#39; but then [I&#39;d have] two dead babies and a dead dog!&quot; <br><br>No matter what she decides, the shows no doubt will reflect Dolly&#39;s long-held personal philosophy, which she also used to reassure herself upon the release of <i>Halos and Horns</i>. <br><br>&quot;I tell myself I did my best, it is what it is and I hope they like it. And then I go on to the next one.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Borders Interview</font><br><font size="2">August 2002</font><br><br><b><font size="1">Stairway to the Heavens: Dolly Parton Volunteers Her Thoughts on Tennessee, God, and Led Zeppelin</font></b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Borders Interview" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Borders Interview" width="455"></div><br><br>It&rsquo;s 8 a.m., and Dolly Parton is already conducting her third interview of the day from inside her Nashville office. Born in 1946, the fourth of 12 children, Parton says she got in the early-bird habit long ago, often making breakfast for her family while growing up poor in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee. Despite her relatively humble upbringing, the effervescent Parton gained national fame while still in her early 20s as a featured performer on <i>The Porter Wagoner Show</i>. With prominent roles in <i>9 to 5</i>, (highlighted by the Parton-penned, Grammy-winning title song) and <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i>, Parton beguiled movie audiences with her sense of humor, platinum-blonde wigs, and, of course, a substantial bust line that remains a frequent subject of Parton&rsquo;s self-deprecating jokes. In 1999, the singer-songwriter earned a well-deserved spot in the Country Music Hall of Fame for such masterpieces as &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; &quot;Jolene,&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; which later became a smash for Whitney Houston.<br> Following up her recent, bluegrass-flavored albums <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and <i>Little Sparrow</i> (the latter including a spirited rendition of Collective Soul&rsquo;s &quot;Shine,&quot; for which she earned her seventh Grammy Award this year), Parton again showcases her one-of-a-kind voice on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, inviting musicians from her Dollywood theme park to join members of her regular band. Citing the mountains surrounding her home as inspiration, Parton went on a songwriting spree and chose to cover a pair of delightfully unexpected tunes: Bread&rsquo;s soft-rock favorite &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&rsquo;s hard-rock epic &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br><b>Some people have said that, with your recent albums, you&rsquo;ve returned to your roots. Do you feel you ever left?</b><b><br></b> <b>Dolly Parton:</b> You don&rsquo;t ever leave. Not me, the country girl. Back when you&rsquo;re trying to make a living, you&rsquo;ve got to do everything you can to get a record played to make enough money, to be accepted on the charts. And so I had to work toward a formula, which I hate. You don&rsquo;t make as much money doing what I&rsquo;m doing now, and there&rsquo;s a reason I had to try other things in the early days. If I could&rsquo;ve made a living doing this kind of music, I probably never would&rsquo;ve ventured out. I joke that I had to get rich in order to sing like I&rsquo;m poor again.<br> <b>What does this album title signify?</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> I think we&rsquo;re all a mixture of halos and horns. I know I am. It&rsquo;s like the first verse of that song: &quot;Tempted and tried with each step we take / We stumble and slide and make our mistakes, ask God to forgive us...&quot; It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re always backsliding. I&rsquo;ve always said, &quot;I&rsquo;m too good to be bad, too bad to be good.&quot; I&rsquo;m always trapped somewhere between halos and horns, but my heart is good and I&rsquo;m hoping God judges by the intent of our heart. If He does, then I&rsquo;m fine. <br><br><b>Was &quot;Hello God&quot; inspired by September 11?</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> I did write a song the day after called &quot;Color Me America,&quot; which I do in my stage show. &quot;Raven Dove&quot; and &quot;Hello God&quot; were also inspired by where we all are at this time. It came from realizing how fragile we are, how everything can change with the blink of an eye, how we&rsquo;re like little children&mdash;as the scripture says. We think we can do whatever we want until we get in big trouble. Then we want to run to our parents. Sort of like how we all turned to God at that time because everybody was so scared, you didn&rsquo;t know what to do. You felt so fragile, so frightened. Every morning when I get up, the first thing I do is say, &quot;Well, hello God.&quot; I&rsquo;ve been doing that for years. It came to me that it would make a good song. When I started saying &quot;Hello God, are you out there? Are you listening? Can you hear us?&quot; all that stuff started coming to me about what I felt and I know so many other people were feeling. That&rsquo;s one of my favorites on the album. <br><br><b>Talk about your home in Tennessee and the inspiration it provides.</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> It was our old home place. I tried to buy it for years, long after we&rsquo;d moved away, when I first started making enough money. Many years back, I was able to buy it. I&rsquo;ve got it fixed up like a retreat, tried to re-create it the way it was. It&rsquo;s just wonderful. I have a whole little village up there: the old country store, an old church on the mountain. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve gathered everything from my past and my childhood and made it into a village. But it&rsquo;s the same old house, same old barn. I go up there and I feel momma and daddy, feel what I remember from childhood. It&rsquo;s amazing how it inspires me. <br><br><b>There&rsquo;s such genuine emotion on this album and, for that matter, on all your recordings. Do you think that sincerity has generally been lost in today&rsquo;s music?</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> Yes, I do. I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons everybody&rsquo;s so excited about bluegrass, the old mountain music. People are longing, even city people, even people that love hard rock and loud electric music, for some sort of realism. Progress is a great thing, but even though we&rsquo;re so high-tech, we don&rsquo;t want to grow so fast and so far that we forget that we come from the dirt and the land. People are connecting; it takes them back, sort of like how people long for the old cowboys and westerns. It gives you a feeling of being outdoors, being human, part of nature. <br><br><b>Talk about the parallels between bluegrass and Celtic music.</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> All of these people here in Kentucky and in the Smoky Mountains were Irish and English. People developed in their own way and started adding their own sounds, their lifestyle and their environment. It&rsquo;s all about telling stories. I think all that started when there were no TVs, no radios, and no telephones. That&rsquo;s how people carried news around. That&rsquo;s why there are so many sad songs. People would take all these songs around to different villages back in the old days. That&rsquo;s kind of how we still do it in the Smokies. I think that&rsquo;s tied into what our ancestors brought over and then what we added to it just by living in this world. But it&rsquo;s all so very real, and it&rsquo;s how people express their souls, their thoughts, their feelings.<br> <b>Are you planning to continue exploring film work? Can you compare the music and movie worlds?</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> Well, there&rsquo;s no comparison. I&rsquo;ve always said that music is my first love. But I do love the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to do so many things. The only reason I&rsquo;m not doing more movies is I&rsquo;m not getting offered any good parts. It&rsquo;s like it was when my music died away as far as the public was concerned. When all the new country music came, for artists over 35 years old, you might as well forget about it. Of course I&rsquo;m a little over that, but it&rsquo;s the same with movies unless it&rsquo;s like the character I played in <i>Steel Magnolias</i>. But I&rsquo;d love to do more films when good roles come along. <br><br><b>OK, I&rsquo;ll ask the Led Zeppelin question: Why &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;?</b><b><br></b> <b>DP:</b> I do songs that I just love. My husband has such an odd taste in music, and he loves Led Zeppelin. He&rsquo;s been a &quot;Led Head&quot; from day one and also loves bluegrass and big-band music. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was always Carl&rsquo;s favorite. It was kind of like &quot;our song&quot; because at romantic times or sweet times, we&rsquo;d just be riding around in the car and if that would come on, Lord, he&rsquo;d just knock us out of the car turning it up full blast. For years I&rsquo;ve wanted to try to do it, but it made no sense with the other stuff I&rsquo;d done. I thought, &quot;I&rsquo;m going to try it like I did &lsquo;Shine&rsquo; and see if I can&rsquo;t blend it in.&quot; It was personal to us, so I just took a chance on it. Some people said I was nuts to try. I said, &quot;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why not. What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen? What are they going to do, not play me on the radio? They&rsquo;re not anyway.&quot; [Laughing.] </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Mix</font><br><font size="2">August 1, 2002</font><br><br><b>The Gospel According to Dolly Parton</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Mix" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mix" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton&#39;s flamboyant, exaggerated, country girl-meets-Hollywood look is one of the most identifiable in American culture. A less-talented or savvy artist might not have been able to get away with such an audacious visual statement, but Parton is so talented as a singer and a songwriter that there&#39;s no question that her true gifts shine through. <br><br>Our interview was held in a small house at Parton&#39;s walled Southwestern-style office complex in midtown Nashville. When I was led through the courtyard and into the dwelling, the first space I entered was a well-lit, mirrored dressing and make-up room adjacent to a homey living area and kitchen. <br><br>Almost immediately, Parton entered the room looking like&hellip;Dolly! She seemed to glow, yet she was very accommodating and down-to-Earth; in fact, she offered to fix me breakfast. I didn&#39;t doubt the sincerity of her offer, but I didn&#39;t exactly want to put her to work. <br><br>At the time of the interview, Parton was excited about her newly completed album for the Sugar Hill label, <i>Halos and Horns</i>, which she eagerly previewed for me on a jam box. It features a new band she calls The Blue-niques (for &ldquo;unique bluegrass&rdquo;); members include Steve Turner, Kent Wells, Jimmy Mattingly, Richard Dennison, Gary &ldquo;Biscuit&rdquo; Davis, Brent Truitt, Jay Weaver and Randy Kohrs. <br><br>Fans of her last two bluegrass and roots music albums (also on Sugar Hill) will probably love this collection, too. It contains more of Parton&#39;s fine original compositions, as well as two classics, which, as Parton puts it, she &ldquo;Dolly-ized&rdquo;: Bread&#39;s &ldquo;If&rdquo; and, believe it or not, Led Zeppelin&#39;s &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven.&rdquo; <br><br><i>Hello.</i><i><br></i> Do you want some breakfast? I can make you some toast and eggs if you need it. <br><br><i>I appreciate it, but this is just fine (rummaging through candy in the coffee table bowl).</i><i><br></i> Are you sure? I&#39;m happy to do it.<br><i>You don&#39;t need to do that, but thanks. Snickers and Milky Way: This is a fine starter for the day.</i><i><br></i> Like typical studio people, you&#39;re eating candy right away. [Laughs] Eat junk. You can do like we all do in the studio, just throw the wrappers on the table. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get rid of it later. Now, you can eat all the candy you want. <br><br><i>Unlike the last two albums, the majority of this new album features original compositions. Many of those seem to have a spiritual undercurrent. The title track is really strong.</i><i><br></i> I wrote several songs after September 11, like we all did. That event really just shook everybody&#39;s confidence: You saw how fragile life is and how small and fearful we all are. You just realize that there must be something greater than you; otherwise, you&#39;d totally fall apart. You think you can just screw around all you want to until you get in trouble, and then the first thing you say is, &ldquo;Oh God, help me now.&rdquo; It&#39;s sort of like a child getting hurt. <br><br>I just felt real inspired, and this idea started rolling out and I wrote &ldquo;Halos and Horns&rdquo; in no time. I have very strong feelings about that song. It&#39;s a real solid country, bluegrass thing, one of those hard-singing songs. I really like it. <br><br>This album is really just life stories. It goes from heartache to heaven. There are some gospel things, like &ldquo;Hello God&rdquo;, to one that is talking about swimming naked in a pond. [Laughs] Spirituality to sexuality. <br><br><i>You could say that it&#39;s all part of the big picture.</i><i><br></i> Yeah, well, it&#39;s true. That&#39;s how I look at life.<br><i>When I first heard that you were going to do &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven,&rdquo; I thought that was an audacious choice. But when I sang through the melody in my head before I came here, I could hear you singing it.</i><i><br></i> I love that song, and I always thought it sounded like a spiritual song. Robert Plant said he had always thought of it as a spiritual song and was thrilled that I had put the choir on it, &#39;cause he had always heard it like that. I believe a good song can be done any way if you really mean it from the heart.<br> Everybody&#39;s been trying to get a copy of my version of this song. They&#39;ve been offering everybody money to bootleg it. Rock stations have been calling us, and country stations just out of curiosity. I&#39;m sure some of them think it&#39;s a big joke. I&#39;m sure that some of them are going to want to crucify me, and maybe they will. But in all sincerity, I did it because I love the song. <br><br>I take this stuff so seriously. These things are sacred to me. When I decided I was going to do &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven,&rdquo; I truly felt like I was walking on sacred ground. It&#39;s the same with a song like &ldquo;If.&rdquo; When you get a great song that&#39;s a classic that&#39;s touched the lives of so many people, you have to handle it with delicate care. You just don&#39;t go in and put anything on it. You look at it like, &ldquo;What can I do with this great song that is a little different and will still not be a gimmick, but to make it my own?&rdquo; <br><br>I remember all the quality songs through the years that I&#39;ve heard, and I just loved David Gates&#39; stuff and the group Bread. I did &ldquo;If&rdquo; up-tempo, sort of like what Ray Stevens did with &ldquo;Misty.&rdquo; It kind of reminds me of the song &ldquo;Everybody&#39;s Talkin&#39;.&rdquo; It&#39;s kind of got that rolling thing, and I think it worked. <br><br><i>A defining quality that seems to push your career and persona along is fearlessness.</i><i><br></i> You&#39;re right. What have I got to lose? If you don&#39;t take some chances, what are you going to do that&#39;s of any quality? I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes in the minds of some people, but I&#39;ve made few, if any, in my own mind. If I make five mistakes and do one great thing, well, I&#39;m not going to worry about the five mistakes I made. I&#39;m going to just wallow in the glory of the one great thing I did in hopes that it brought some joy to somebody else. What some would call a mistake is just me trying. If it works, fine. If it don&#39;t, what are they going to do? Kill me? Then, if they kill me, are they going to eat me?! [Laughs] You can&#39;t really go about your life like that and be productive. That&#39;s why I think I&#39;ve been at it for so long. <br><br>I&#39;m <i>up there</i>. I&#39;m 56 years old, and I&#39;ve been doing this since I was a little kid. I started writing serious songs when I was seven. I started singing on TV when I was 10. I was just a little backwoods country kid that had a more outgoing personality than some of the other backwoods kids. I was still nervous, but my desire to do things was always greater than my fear of it. I just always kind of drug from that God thing. My grandpa was a preacher, and I guess at an impressionable age, I believed that through God I could do everything. And I still have a lot of faith in God, as I perceive him, and that&#39;s why so many of my songs have an inspirational feeling. <br><br>Everybody thinks of God as a different thing. To me, God is that greater, higher energy, that greater, wiser wisdom. It&#39;s that thing in all of us that we all have to draw from. I&#39;ve always trusted God and trusted myself, which to me are intertwined. I&#39;m a creative person, and what gifts I have come from that divine place that I try to tap into. So who have I got to be afraid of? <br><br><i>How did this new album evolve?</i><i><br></i> This album all started because I was really just trying to find a band. I&#39;d been writing songs for several months, and I went to east Tennessee to try to find as many musicians back home as I could for a band. A lot of these people work at Dollywood [Parton&#39;s successful amusement park]. Gary Davis, who helped me pull all of this together, put the band together. I thought, &ldquo;I&#39;m just going to go in and demo these songs through my publishing company and pay for this and find a good studio up home. I&#39;ll bring these musicians in to play on the demo; that way, I can feel them out.&rdquo; Well, when we got in there, they just all sounded great from the start. <br><br>I was looking for a good studio in the area where I could stay up in my old Tennessee mountain home and write. Then, Gary Davis told me about a really great studio called Southern Sound Studio outside of Knoxville. Danny Brown, who was the engineer for this, is one of the partners of the studio. They do a lot of important stuff there. So, I decided to go ahead and do a whole bunch of songs there; we did 25 songs over the course of several weeks. <br><br><i>You self-produced this effort, and it sounds like you have another album in the can.</i><i><br></i> Yeah, if I want to do that. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do next. I always just let the spirit lead me. But, definitely, there&#39;s enough stuff for another album at some point. <br><br>When we started doing this, I told Steve Buckingham, who&#39;s my friend and has worked with me as my producer and co-producer for 12 or 13 years, he also runs the label and everything, &ldquo;This stuff is turning out really good. It sounds like it could be a record.&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;Well, just go on with it. Just let what happens happen.&rdquo; So I did. I missed working with Steve on it, but he&#39;s been really behind me all the way with this project. I was so excited about my new band because I haven&#39;t had a band together in 10 years. We&#39;re going to be doing some concerts in July and August. We&#39;re going to go out and promote this, and if it feels good, then I&#39;m going to do some touring. <br><br><i>You didn&#39;t tour behind your previous two albums?</i><i><br></i> No. We never could pull it together to where we could tour. Jerry [Douglas, dobro player] is with Alison [Krauss], and they are all committed to other projects. It was driving Steve crazy trying to pull a band together, so he is thrilled to death that I&#39;ve got a band now. <br><br><i>Dollywood is one of the most successful theme parks in the country. What inspired that project?</i><i><br></i> Well, a business mind and the whole idea that the Smoky Mountains is the most visited national park in the United States. We got almost 3 million people last year, and we&#39;re only open six full months [a year]. It came from me just wanting to do something to make my people proud of me, and it&#39;s also really provided a lot of jobs for the area. It&#39;s helped a lot of people, and it&#39;s helped me, too. I just thought it would be great to have something to leave for my family. <br><br><i>I found it interesting that Dollywood&#39;s ad campaign was focused on a world music theme. You came from the mountains of east Tennessee but you&#39;ve seen the world, and I was struck with a sense that you were bringing the world into the place you were raised.</i><i><br></i> That&#39;s exactly right. It&#39;s a wonderful thing, and people have responded so much to that. That&#39;s my home, I suppose, in that it&#39;s where I was born and raised, and I love the mountains and that&#39;s my foundation. But my home is everywhere. I often joke that home is anywhere I hang my hair. It&#39;s true. Whether it&#39;s Russia or here, I love people. I just feel like I am part of everything. I am part of that bigger picture. <br><br>I perform there several times a year, including benefit shows for the Dollywood Foundation. We have a huge thing that the United Way is in on now called the Imagination Library. For years now, we&#39;ve given scholarships to people with medical and school needs, and we still do. We even have a hotline for kids. Every child that&#39;s born in Sevier County [where Dollywood is located] gets a book a month from the day the child is born until the day it starts kindergarten. We&#39;ve given out thousands of books now all over, and it&#39;s really growing. They call me the Book Lady. It&#39;s a wonderful thing, because my dad couldn&#39;t read or write, and so many of my relatives didn&#39;t get an education, and it was important for me to do that. So, not only is Dollywood a theme park, it really does a lot of good things, and a lot of good stuff comes out of that. <br><br>Now, I&#39;m having to speak to all these educators and teachers, and I hated school growing up. I&#39;ve done more homework in the last five years just working on these projects than I did in 12 years [in school]. <br><br>Somebody said, &ldquo;Well, now that you&#39;re the book lady and you&#39;re involved with these kids and this education, are you going to tone down your look?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Why should I? It was all of that that made all of this that put me in this position! Don&#39;t you get it? I might look like a phony now, but if I start changing things, then I would <i>be</i> a phony. This is who I really am. I see no reason to think that I have to look like a schoolteacher. I&#39;d rather look like a whore. I&#39;m getting the job done, it shouldn&#39;t matter.&rdquo; You know, people are funny about changing. <br><br><i>It&#39;s like a version of &ldquo;Harper Valley PTA.&rdquo;</i><i><br></i> That&#39;s true. A lot of my look came out of a little country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour should be. But then it got to be really comfortable, and I liked it &mdash; just like how people like to dress up. I&#39;ve always said that if I hadn&#39;t have been a woman, then I&#39;d have damn sure been a drag queen. That might be a funny line and people get a kick out of it, but I mean that in all sincerity. I just love it. <br><br>People say, &ldquo;Do you wear those shoes around all the time? Do you wear that makeup all the time?&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Yeah, I do most of this even when I&#39;m by myself.&rdquo; I can&#39;t stand to walk around slouchy all day. When I&#39;m alone writing songs, sometimes I&#39;ll go for a couple of days and I won&#39;t put on makeup and stuff, but I don&#39;t look at myself. Sometimes, I look in the mirror and I&#39;ll say, &ldquo;Oh good Lord, go clean up!&rdquo; Everybody&#39;s comfort level is their own. <br><br>Thank God that early on I understood who I was. I understood that being from a family of 12, I was in a spot where nobody was going to pay that much attention to me, so I had to get to know myself through God and through the birds and the bees and the stuff outside and my imagination. Thank God I had talent. But most of my family had talent. I took it and channeled it, and the better I got, the more I wanted to do good, and the more I realized that this is important stuff. <br><br>When I get one of those songs that&#39;s got all that heart and guts and soul and tears, whether it&#39;s a happy song or not, that a certain kind of song and my soul just dance. It&#39;s in that real place, and as long as it comes from my gut and from my heart in a very real place, I think people will accept it. <br><br>I&#39;m proud of Dollywood and all the business stuff that I&#39;ve been at least smart enough to be wise to, where I could make my money doing other things. But, to me, all that other stuff just affords my habit, which is music. First and foremost, above everything else, I&#39;m a singer, a musician and a writer. I never got so busy I didn&#39;t write songs. I write all the time, and I love it. I pay for my own sessions, then I lease them to whatever label, and then my masters go back to me. After a certain amount of time, I&#39;ll want my masters throughout the years to go to my family. That&#39;s the way I&#39;m doing it. But I&#39;d be singing if I had to sell it out of the trunk of my car. I will be doing my singing and my writing no matter what. <br><br><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Mix" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mix" width="455"></div><br><div align="center"><b>ENGINEERING &quot;HALOS AND HORNS&quot;</b><br><br><div align="left">When Dolly Parton began looking for a place to record <i>Halos and Horns</i>, her production assistant, Gary &ldquo;Biscuit&rdquo; Davis, brought her to Southern Sound Studio, a multiroom recording and mastering facility located in Knoxville, Tenn. The Stephen Durr-designed studio, which is near Parton&#39;s east Tennessee retreat and less than an hour away from the Smoky Mountains, has been at its current location since 1994. That year, it was recognized by <i>Mix</i> as one of the best-designed new facilities in the country. It is owned by Danny Brown (who engineered and mixed the project) and Paul Jones. <br><br>When Brown began working with Parton&#39;s voice, he initially worked with a Neumann M149, and his mic pre of choice was a Drawmer 1969. &ldquo;The Drawmer 1969 seemed to sound the best with Dolly&#39;s vocal and the M149,&rdquo; says Brown. &ldquo;Though the M149 is very EQ-friendly, we found we had to add quite a bit of 5k to 12k to get the presence Dolly was looking for. We then brought in a Sony C-800G, and the results were fantastic. Her voice translated so well through this mic with no EQ at all.&rdquo; The Avalon VT-737 became the mic pre of choice for the Sony mic and Parton&#39;s voice. <br><br>&ldquo;One of the great aspects of the Sony is that it has little to no off-axis coloration, even in the cardioid position. Every time Dolly stepped up to the mic, she delivered a vocal performance; every song, every vocal track,&rdquo; Brown adds. &ldquo;She is a very emotional singer. Her mouth never stayed right in front of the mic. The Sony was very forgiving and seemed to capture every detail of her voice, no matter where her head was turned. We were all very pleased with the end result.&rdquo; <br><br>A new Universal Audio LA-2A was used on her vocals during the mix. Parton&#39;s vocals were tracked without EQ and just about 1 to 2 dB of compression from the Avalon VT-737. During the mix, the LA-2A was used with a bit of EQ from the VT-737, mostly just to add a little more air to her sound. <br><br>&ldquo;We did some vocal comping, but that became difficult at times. What I mean is, which line do you pick? Which verse do you go for when they all sound so incredible?&rdquo; Brown says with a laugh, who did the comps with Richard Dennison and Davis. &ldquo;We found ourselves basically comping for what we thought would best suit Dolly, because every take was excellent.&rdquo; <br><br>Everything was recorded on the iZ Technology RADAR 24. Brown mixed on a DDA Profile 56-input console with Uptown moving fader automation. The mix was monitored on Dynaudio M-1 near-fields. <br><br>&ldquo;We ran the mix bus through a Waves L2 into an Alesis Masterlink at 24-bit, 44.1,&rdquo; Brown says. &ldquo;It then went to Soundcurrent Mastering, which is based at our facility, to be mastered by Seva. Nuendo was used to do some editing. The main monitors for tracking were custom TADs, powered by Crown Macro reference amps.&rdquo; </div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">August 6, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>ON THE ROAD AGAIN</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Dolly Parton is back on tour with music from a surprising new album</b></font><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div></div><br><blockquote>It&#39;s been 10 years since Dolly Parton went on the road. Now, with the release of her new album, Halos And Horns, the country superstar-turned-bluegrass diva is more than ready to go back.</blockquote> <br> <br>But this time things will be different. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;ll be simple,&quot; reveals Dolly of the 13-city tour across America. &quot;There will be less production and more music. We won&#39;t have big lights or big sound or big videos. It&#39;s about the music. It&#39;s about going out and not having to sing over the electric guitars or the drums. I can just focus on the songs and tell the stories.&quot; <br><br>Dolly&#39;s been telling stories and charting No. 1s for over 30 years. She wrote all but two songs on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, and says she &quot;just knows&quot; when she&#39;s written something special. <br><br>&quot;You feel it,&quot; she explains. &quot;It&#39;ll be like a sting or a burn. Or you&#39;ll write a line and think, &#39;Oh this is <i>so</i> good!&#39; I write all the time. I always think of my songs as my kids. Some of them are prettier than others, but you love &#39;em all the same. &quot;Nothing is ever lost,&quot; she continues. &quot;You have to write them all. And I wouldn&#39;t know a hit if it jumped up and bit me in the ass! But I know what I like as a writer. I know when I&#39;ve written something that&#39;s going to stand on its own through time. The others come and go.&quot; <br><br>One song on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> has more than stood the test of time. &quot;Not For Me,&quot; a heartwrenchingly sad ballad, was actually written in 1964 when Dolly first moved to Nashville. While searching for another song, Dolly stumbled across the forgotten, and never recorded, &quot;Not For Me.&quot; <br><br>But not everybody liked the forgotten song. &quot;My husband can&#39;t stand to hear me sing sad songs,&quot; admits Dolly. &quot;I said, &#39;Well, Dad...&#39;, that&#39;s what I call him, &#39;that&#39;s so old I don&#39;t even know <i>what</i> I was thinking then!&#39; But I&#39;m sure that must have been <i>exactly</i> what I was feeling at the time. I go through many times like that. <br><br>&quot;People always think you don&#39;t have feelings if you&#39;re a star,&quot; she adds, &quot;or that you don&#39;t get depressed. But I just write whatever I feel. Sometimes when I&#39;ve been through my saddest or most sorrowful things, I have to write them down. Then I feel better.&quot; <br><br>Of the two cover songs on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, Bread&#39;s pop ballad &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#39;s classic &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, it&#39;s the Zeppelin tune that&#39;s raising the most eyebrows. Dolly makes it her own, adding a spiritual element, complete with a choir and ad-libbed lines. <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a song I&#39;ve been meaning to do for years,&quot; confesses Dolly, who was inspired by her husband of 36 years, Carl Dean. &quot;He loves hard rock music and bluegrass, and Led Zeppelin is his favorite,&quot; she says with a smile. &quot;We love &#39;Stairway To Heaven.&#39; It&#39;s one of our special songs. But I never had a way I could think of doing it until I started doing this bluegrass stuff. <br><br>&quot;I knew everybody was expecting me to do something completely off the wall on this record, so I thought, &#39;It&#39;s time to do &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot;&#39; I figure I&#39;ll get crucified some, but I did it with great respect.&quot; <br><br>Dolly happily reports that the writers, Led Zeppelin&#39;s Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, approved. &quot;We didn&#39;t hear back from them for a while and I thought that meant they didn&#39;t like it,&quot; she notes. &quot;But they had not heard it yet. When they did, Robert Plant said he&#39;d always heard &#39;Stairway&#39; as a spiritual song. He was thrilled that I used the choir on it.&quot; <br><br>As long as the writers like it, Dolly&#39;s not really worried about disapproving critics. &quot;What are they gonna do, shoot me?&quot; she asks, laughing. &quot;Why not take chances? I&#39;m at the age and I&#39;m just the type of personality. I&#39;m going to do as <i>I</i> please from now on. I&#39;ve done as too many people pleased for too many years. Now that I&#39;m back doing the music I want to do, I&#39;m not putting limits on anything. <br><br>&quot;People can pass judgment on me, whatever,&quot; she adds. &quot;I don&#39;t need to be worrying about such things. If they don&#39;t like a particular thing on the CD, but they like something else, that&#39;s why we have those buttons. Just push the button onto the one you like and don&#39;t listen to the others!&quot; <br><br>Dolly&#39;s U.S. tour runs through August. Then she&#39;ll take her music overseas to England and Ireland in the fall. But music is not the only thing this multitalented star is into. In addition to running her successful theme park, Dollywood, she&#39;s also working on a film about the legendary Hollywood sexpot Mae West, with herself in the starring role. The script is on its third rewrite and Dolly declares the role &quot;perfect&quot; for her. <br><br>&quot;I totally relate to her,&quot; she confides. &quot;There are so many similarities, and not just the fact that we&#39;re little and short and overexaggerated. As an actress, it&#39;ll be a chance for me to do something besides a Southern accent, because she was from New York.&quot; <br><br>In the meantime, Dolly is excited to get back out on the road. &quot;I&#39;m not doing this for money because, like they say, there&#39;s no money in bluegrass music,&quot; she declares with her trademark giggle. &quot;But it&#39;s a great music and I love it. I&#39;m addicted to the music, and I can certainly afford my habit. <br><br>&quot;If we love it and it feels good, there&#39;s no telling how many shows I&#39;ll do!&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Entertainment Weekly</font><br><font size="2">August 9, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Splendor In The Bluegrass</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Why Grammy-Winning, Zeppelin-Covering Dolly Parton is One Unsinkable Mountain Mama<br><br><br></b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Entertainment Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Entertainment Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br>At 56, Dolly Parton remains as flashy as &quot;a drag queen&#39;s Christmas tree,&quot; as she puts it, but she&#39;s also morphed into a true bluegrass star. Nineteen ninety-nine&#39;s <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> won a Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album, and &quot;Shine,&quot; a song off of last year&#39;s critically acclaimed <i>Little Sparrow</i>, nabbed a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Now the cantilevered singer is touring for the first time in 10 years, drawing heavily from her new <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, which just entered Billboard&#39;s new bluegrass chart at No. 2. <br><br><b>The biggest surprise on your new album is a spiritual cover of Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; complete with choir.</b><b><br></b> Well, to me, it had a gospel feeling. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s really about, but I always felt God in it. It was a favorite song of [my husband] Carl&#39;s. When I told him I had done [it], it was like, &quot;Oh, God. You did &#39;Stairway&#39; bluegrass?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I did [Collective Soul&#39;s] &#39;Shine,&#39; and you liked that.&quot; But he loved it. And then I got the word back from Robert Plant [that] he was so pleased I had used the choir. <br><br><b>It could have gone either way.</b><b><br></b> It could, and it still might. I just hope it don&#39;t turn out to be &quot;Stairway to Hell.&quot; I&#39;d talked to Alison Krauss about doing it as a duet years ago. She just looked at me [like], &quot;Have you lost your mind? How in the hell could we...?&quot; <br><br><b>You&#39;ve stayed current by reinventing yourself &mdash; this time by going back to your original mountain sound.</b><b><br></b> Well, the tits and the hair and the personality helped build the whole Dolly deal, but it was my music that brought me out of the Smokies. I had to get rich in order to afford to sing like I was poor again. I&#39;d be up shit&#39;s creek if I depended on [bluegrass] to make a livin&#39;. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;ve had this second chance at a first love. <br><br><b>And you&#39;re still making time for a film career. What&#39;s the status of your ABC TV movie about Mae West?</b><b><br></b> They just put some new writers on it to make it true to Dolly Parton as well as Mae West. I&#39;ve got her down, though. I realize just how similar we are, and not just being little and blond and bizarre and ballsy. I certainly ain&#39;t gonna be doing the Southern accent, and that will be the first time I&#39;ve gone outside myself. <br><br><b>You have surprisingly wide appeal. Can you make that last forever?</b><b><br></b> I&#39;m going to try, because I don&#39;t feel old. I&#39;m just as excited as I was when I first came to Nashville, [and] as hyper. I have to stay focused. Otherwise, I would just be a damn squirrel. I take the music real serious, but I don&#39;t take comments or criticism so serious like, &quot;Oh, my God, they don&#39;t like it.&quot; I hope you do, but if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll just try harder next time.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Denver Post</font><br><font size="2">August 9, 2002</font><br><b><br>Parton goes back to her roots</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Denver Post" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Denver Post" width="455"></div><br><br>Riding the dusty coattails of the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack, veteran country artists are rediscovering their mountain roots. But Dolly Parton already has issued three successful projects of what she refers to as &quot;blue mountain music.&quot;<br> In 2000, &quot;The Grass Is Blue,&quot; her first bluegrass collection, won a Grammy Award for best bluegrass album as well as album of the year honors at the International Bluegrass Music Association awards. &quot;Little Sparrow,&quot; released in 2001, was even better - in a similar style, she &quot;grassed it up&quot; on her own material and did an exceptional interpretation of Cole Porter&#39;s &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You,&quot; and her cover of Collective Soul&#39;s &quot;Shine&quot; netted her a Grammy for best female country vocal performance. <br><br>Now there&#39;s the heartfelt Smoky Mountains flavor of her new album, &quot;Halos &amp; Horns.&quot;<br> &quot;My life has been so lucky and so charmed,&quot; Parton, 56, said recently. &quot;I was feeling desperate to get back to music, my first love. I was still writing songs every day, but I wasn&#39;t getting any play on the radio . . . <br><br>&quot;Then Sugar Hill Records, the bluegrass label, did some sort of survey, and of all the different artists who had never done a bluegrass album that they&#39;d love to hear do one, believe it or not, I was right at the top of the list. I said, &quot;Well, I know exactly what songs I&#39;d do . . .&#39; The time was right for it - people evidently like to hear me do that honest American roots stuff.&quot; <br><br>The Appalachian aura of &quot;Halos &amp; Horns&quot; is found on &quot;These Old Bones,&quot; an extraordinary story-song about a witch who proves to be psychic and her daughter who possesses the same powers. Parton portrays the daughter in her own voice and also provides the cracked voice of the old mountain woman. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m doing a video on it! I&#39;m playing both parts - I&#39;m dressing down to create the character of the old mountain woman, and I even had some chipped yellow teeth done. It would be wonderful for a television series or a movie of the week.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Hello God&quot; was written out of Parton&#39;s emotional response to the tragic events of Sept. 11. <br><br>&quot;We don&#39;t know what we need or how lucky we are until something goes wrong, and then we&#39;re like a bunch of kids running to our parents who told us not to be doing that to start with. Hello, God, are you out there? Can you hear us? Have we screwed up so bad that you don&#39;t even want to listen anymore? You&#39;ve given us free choice and look what we&#39;ve done with it.&quot; <br><br>Parton revives Bread&#39;s classic &quot;If,&quot; but the most intriguing track on the album is a basic and extremely poignant cover of Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot; Using a gospel choir, she pulls it off grandly. <br><br>&quot;My husband loves Led Zeppelin, and I&#39;ve heard it all through the years. It&#39;s a classic, no one messes with it - I thought, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll do it, and if it doesn&#39;t turn out, no one will ever know.&#39; I thought the melody lent itself to my voice, it sounded old-world, and I added a few ad-lib lines to make it like someone trying to buy their way to heaven, and it can&#39;t be done - you&#39;ve got to work to get there.<br> &quot;It was a bold move to try it, but who am I afraid of now?&quot; <br><br>Promoting &quot;Halos &amp; Horns,&quot; Parton has hit the road for the first time in a decade, and she&#39;ll visit the Paramount Theatre on Tuesday. The Country Music Hall of Famer is working with some East Tennessee musicians from her Dollywood entertainment complex who participated on the album. <br><br>&quot;A lot of people think Dollywood is a small amusement area, but it&#39;s a theme park - we have a Southern gospel museum in addition to all of our country and bluegrass and mountain folk shows. I picked a lot of those people for my album, because I know how talented they are. <br><br>&quot;Now I put together a group called the Blue-niques. We&#39;re just having a big time!&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Metromix</font><br><font size="2">August 16, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Parton revels in writing</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>The singer&#39;s latest disc shows off a new side<br><br><br></b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Metromix" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Metromix" width="455"></div><br><br>A few decades ago, somewhere between her countrypolitan hit &quot;9 to 5&quot; and the opening of her Dollywood theme park, Dolly Parton became a cartoon. She was the little mountain gal with the bombshell figure, the mountains of hair, the talon-like nails and a twang thicker than molasses. She was never the &quot;Dumb Blonde,&quot; the title of her first hit, but she became a pretty good self-parody. <br><br>Her hillbilly-diva shtick obscured her more substantive talents: She&#39;s a mountain-soul singer and songwriter of astonishing depth and enduring legend. Her tunes have been widely covered by two generations of performers, including non-country artists as diverse as the White Stripes, who frequently perform her &quot;Jolene,&quot; and Whitney Houston, who made Parton $6 million richer by covering her &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; on &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack. <br><br>&quot;I take more pride in my songwriting than anything else,&quot; says Parton, whose first tour in a decade brings her to the House of Blues for a sold-out show Saturday. &quot;If I could do but one thing in show business, it would be to write songs. I love to sing and perform, but I get more personal satisfaction by leaving something in the world that wasn&#39;t there the day before.&quot; <br><br>After a couple of decades of catering to the whims of mainstream country radio, she got back on track in 1999 with the bluegrass album &quot;The Grass is Green.&quot; It was the work of a woman with nothing to lose, and a return to the sound that produced such classics as &quot;Coat of Many Colors&#39;, in which Parton skirted self-pity and nostalgia with deep feeling and a dogged sense of self-determination. She followed it with two more acclaimed acoustic releases, &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; (2000) and the recent &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; (Sugar Hill); she both presaged and benefited from the mountain-soul revival stirred by the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack last year.<br> &quot;It was one of those funny cult films like &#39;The Rocky Horror Picture Show,&#39; &quot; Parton says. &quot;But it got people to pay attention to the soundtrack, which is phenomenal.&quot;<br> Parton knows a thing or three about attracting attention. On &quot;Halos and Horns,&quot; she takes on one of the most widely known rock songs of the last 30 years, Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; and turns it into a bluegrass ballad, even adding a verse of her own. <br><br>&quot;I always loved the song, but everybody said I shouldn&#39;t do it,&quot; she says. &quot;Even my husband, Carl, who is a big Led Zeppelin fan, looked at me like I was crazy. Then he listened and said, &#39;You&#39;re probably the only person who could have gotten away with that.&#39; He still hasn&#39;t told me whether he likes it or not. But I always thought that &#39;Stairway to Heaven&#39; would fit my voice well, with those long chords and that old-world, Celtic sound.&quot; <br><br>She was validated when Zep&#39;s Robert Plant and Jimmy Page messaged her with congratulations. &quot;Robert said he liked that I used a choir on the song, because he always heard it as kind of a spiritual thing,&quot; Parton says. <br><br>Even more provocative is her &quot;Hello God,&quot; a post-Sept. 11 song that digs far deeper lyrically than recent country anthems such as Alan Jackson&#39;s &quot;Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)&quot; and Toby Keith&#39;s &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I actually wrote some patriotic songs myself during that time, but I figured everyone else would too,&quot; Parton says. &quot;My song was more directed to God, and not Sept. 11 specifically, and how we&#39;ve been given free will and free choice, and how some of our choices bring some of this stuff on us. It also talks about how we don&#39;t turn to God until we need him. We take him for granted. And, sometimes he takes us for granted. How could God let this happen? It was the day after, and all these feelings of being unsafe and uneasy were stirred up, and I wanted to write a song that expressed how small we are in comparison to the greatness of all things.&quot; <br><br>Too bad the song tries too hard to sell itself; in contrast to the mostly stripped-down arrangements of her recent albums, &quot;Hello God&quot; drowns in the epic sentimentality of a backing chorus that belongs on one of her overbaked &#39;80s singles. For Parton, once the queen of Nashville excess, some habits apparently die hard. Yet even her schmaltz comes with a dose of bravado. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve had people say to me that some of us are cashing in by expressing themselves about Sept. 11,&quot; she says. &quot;But if we don&#39;t express ourselves, who will? I think it&#39;s the duty of artists, writers and poets to express themselves about events like this. This is still America, ain&#39;t it? Even though we are a little weak and wobbly right now in an emotional sense, we still have our freedom of speech. The terrorists haven&#39;t taken that away from us yet.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Women Who Rock</font><br><font size="2">Fall 2002</font><br><b><br></b><div class="h3"><b>Today&#39;s Country Music Deserves The Bird</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>They&#39;ve gone gold and platinum many times over, and been showered with hundreds of awards.

But over the past few years, since the genre has become not only hungry for pop-chart success but also a breeding ground for sexy abs, she has had problems appealing to today&#39;s country tastes. Yet instead of whining about it, Dolly&#39;s decided to flip the bird to country music and travel back to the comforting down-home sounds of her East Tennessee youth: Appalachian folk and mountain music. Her new album is <i>Halos and Horns</i> [Sugar Hill]. <br><br><b>It must have been frustrating to fit your music into a scene that wasn&#39;t accepting you, Dolly.</b> <br>It got real frustrating for me in the business for the last seven or so years. With all the new country acts, we couldn&#39;t get played on the radio. I was still serious about making great music, but I didn&#39;t know what to do. The last time I was in this situation was when I was a kid. <br><br><b>So what did you do?</b> <br>I just don&#39;t worry about getting played on the radio anymore. I decided to be true to the music I love. I&#39;m not trying to be a pop star. But thanks to a soundtrack called <i>O Brother Where Art Thou</i>, people have started listening to old-time music again, which is exactly what I&#39;m playing! <br><br><b>It appears that more and more artists have abandoned the glossy studio sound of pop country.</b> <br>Wow, what a blessing that is! Bluegrass and this mountain acoustic music have been bubbling under for a long time. It takes a huge burden off me now that I can play this kind of music. At this point in my life, I like to say that I had to get rich to sing like I was poor. But there&#39;s no pressure from a major label. I pay for these recordings myself. Heck, I&#39;d record this kind of music if I had to pay for it and had to sell it out of the trunk of my car! We&#39;re all doing this for the love of the music, and it&#39;s wonderful that people are responding. <br><br><b>How do you feel about leaving the music of Nashville behind?</b> <br>Well, it&#39;s better for me not to think about what&#39;s happening over there. Now I can record anything I want to, as long as it is real&mdash;made with real emotions for real people. At the end of the day, after making this music, I feel like I&#39;ve reached a great climax, made great love, and I need to smoke a cigarette. And I don&#39;t even smoke! </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Boston Globe</font><br><font size="2">September 2, 2002</font><br><br><b>Parton has made her own stairway to heaven</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Boston Globe" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Boston Globe" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton is at home with Tennessee mountain music. She was singing it long before &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; became the breakout record of the past two years. <br><br>So what gives on her new album, &quot;Halos and Horns&quot;? There&#39;s plenty of sweet mountain bluegrass, and then comes the album&#39;s last song, which has the acoustic world perking up its ears in disbelief. <br><br>It&#39;s Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; <br><br>Rather than an embarrassment, it&#39;s the highlight of the album. It&#39;s done brilliantly, in a haunting, banjo-flecked version with a climax featuring a gospel choir that has won praise from the song&#39;s original singer, Robert Plant. <br><br>Covers of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; have been done through the years (hey, Tiny Tim did one), but as Parton says, &quot;Mine is a lot more serious.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I thought of it more as a gospel song,&quot; Parton says from her home near Nashville. &quot;I took it very seriously.&quot; <br><br>Moreover, it&#39;s proof positive that acoustic mountain music and rock-and-roll need not be incompatible. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was a song that Parton had listened to for years, so it wasn&#39;t just a whimsical, spur-of-the-moment move. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve always loved the song,&quot; she says. &quot;And my husband, Carl, is a huge Led Zeppelin freak. He plays their albums full blast at home. He especially loves to play &#39;Stairway to Heaven.&#39; I&#39;ll hear it from one end of the house to the other. But the melody fits my voice, and I&#39;ve been thinking of doing it for a long time.&quot; <br><br>Yet the new album almost appeared without &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Parton recorded it but needed approval from Zep songsmiths Plant and Jimmy Page to release it. &quot;I sent it to them, but they had been out of town and hadn&#39;t heard it,&quot; Parton says. &quot;Then just two weeks before approval was due, I heard that they really liked it. And Robert was thrilled that I put the choir on it, because he also thought of it as a gospel song. <br><br>&quot;Really, people shouldn&#39;t be too surprised that I recorded it. I&#39;ve done rock songs before. I also did Collective Soul&#39;s &#39;Shine&#39; not long ago. A good song will fit anywhere if you do it justice.&quot; <br><br>These days, Parton, 56, is doing pretty much what she pleases. But like many artists, she&#39;s doing it apart from the major record labels. She is aligned with the respected indie Sugar Hill Records, which is known for acoustic music and is giving her free rein in making it. And it&#39;s perfect timing, in the wake of the &quot;O Brother&quot; breakthrough. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;re all swirling around in the success of that,&quot; she says. &quot;Who could have predicted a success like that? Anyone who says he could is lying.&quot; <br><br>Not that anything is going to stop Parton. She has made 72 albums and copyrighted 3,000 songs. And the tunes keep coming. &quot;I&#39;m always walking around the house and coming up with a melody and a chorus,&quot; she says. &quot;I write something every day, even when I&#39;m sick.&quot; <br><br>She is so upbeat that she fairly bubbles during the interview. &quot;I&#39;m as excited now as when I left for Nashville in 1964,&quot; says Parton, a native of Sevier, Tenn., who once lived in a log cabin with no running water or electricity. &quot;I don&#39;t have time to get old. I don&#39;t have time to dwell on it. I still have a childlike nature. Everything is exciting to me. I&#39;m a very positive person. I get up every day and expect good things to happen.&quot;<br> The good things are continuing. Parton has become fabulously wealthy (&quot;I had to become rich so I could sing like I was poor,&quot; she says), and she notes that 2.5 million visitors come annually to visit her Dollywood theme park. &quot;We&#39;ve been open for 17 years now, and every year things seem to get better,&quot; she says. &quot;We have arts and crafts and music and great food spread over an amusement park with 120 acres. I&#39;ve been very lucky, and I count my blessings every day. Life has been good to me.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Irish Independent</font><br><font size="2">October 13, 2002</font><br><br><b>When Dolly met Barry</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Irish Independent" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Irish Independent" width="455"></div><br><br>. . . sparks flew. Both of them flirted outrageously but behind the chemistry was great sadness as the pneumatic Ms Parton told Mr Egan the truth about her &#39;open&#39; marriage and why the Queen of Country can&#39;t ever have any children. <br><br>FEELING like Charlie McCreevey on LSD, I do a quick run through on budgets with Dolly Parton. The dress Dolly is wearing &quot;probably cost me $38,000. It cost a fortune and it looks so cheap, don&#39;t it?&quot; Her breasts (&quot;jacked up and pulled up, but I always had big boobs) have been enhanced a long time ago at a cost of $3,000. <br><br>&quot;It ain&#39;t cheap! That was along time ago.&quot; <br><br>Why not just get a good wonder bra? <br><br>&quot;Why don&#39;t you start asking me something else,&quot; she snaps. <br><br>She&#39;s also had botox and collagen. &quot;I will never graduate from collagen,&quot; she says.<br> Are you not worried about ending up like the Bride of Wildenstein in New York? <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t do freakies,&quot; she says, &quot;I have good skin and I am very careful about what I do. I just do nips and tucks, especially where my face is concerned.&quot;<br> Dolly&#39;s desire for cartoon physical perfection bigger, bolder, brassier will never be done justice by even her gargantuan appetite for plastic surgery. &quot;Plastic surgeons make mountains out of molehills,&quot; she says, a la Mae West. &quot;I never know what is going to come out of my mouth. Sometimes it scares me.&quot; <br><br>I won&#39;t quote you on that (I don&#39;t believe I actually wink at her). &quot;Or what goes into it!&quot; she howls. &quot;No, I never know what I am going to say. I just say what comes to my mind. I feel safe in doing it. A lot of it is to entertain myself. It is important to me that I enjoy my life so I entertain myself as much as I entertain you.&quot; She says had she been born a man she would have been a drag queen. No need. Dolly was RuPaul (the world&#39;s answer to Mr Pussy) before RuPaul was even born. <br><br>She looks like a very expensively assembled porno cartoon come to life in the third floor suite of the Shelbourne Hotel. Embracing Parton as we were introduced, I deliberately held her tighter and for longer than was normal; I wanted to know what it was like. <br><br>Dame Dolly beckons me to the sofa where I remain for the next hour. She flirts like a sailor on ship leave. Her permanent eye contact and casual touches of my knee do much to establish Parton&#39;s charm. It is one of the campest and happiest hours of my life. Well, she laughs at everything I say. And when Dolly Parton laughs her breasts jump up and down like nobody&#39;s business, least of all mine in the normal run of things. But for the moment, she plays Barbara Winsdor to my Sid James. It is Carry On Up The Shelbourne. Dolly Does D2. <br><br>As a boy, I tell her, whenever somebody said something especially obvious at school, we would rebuke the person with two rhetorical but timeless questions. Is the Pope Catholic? Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back? She finds the notion that school kids on the other side of the Atlantic would be using her name in this manner utterly hilarious. <br><br>&quot;I do sleep on my back sometimes,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I don&#39;t have to. I am used to them.&quot; When I and my friends had reached the rebellious hormone stage, Rebecca Parton had left the two-room farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, near the Smoky Mountains National Forest. She was the fourth of 12 children; her mother, Avie Lee Parton, was married at 15 and Dolly says she was always having one on her and one in her. She can remember being little and not feeling pretty as a young girl. She thought she was unattractive as a teenager. She says it was from that unhappy place that the Dolly Parton look sprang from. Her hair would never do anything she wanted it to do so she exaggerated it. Her hands were short so her wore nails as long as her fingers. She was short so she wore shoes with five inch heels. <br><br>Parton dresses awfully; not for nothing has she described her look as equal parts the Mother Goose and Cinderella and the local hooker. She is the patron saint for working-class women of a certain age who dress as boldly as possible to assert themselves in a man&#39;s world. <br><br>She grew up in an extremely religious family her mother&#39;s beliefs were the Pentecostal Church of God, talking in tongues and laying on of hands variety; while her father leaned towards the more strict Baptists. And there was young Dolly Rebecca Parton, short of leg and long of nerve, walking around lil&#39; ol Locust Ridge dressed like the town whore. &quot;My grandfather thought I was going straight to hell from the time I was 15 years old. I was a Jezebel going straight to hell!&quot; <br><br>So when they told you that you couldn&#39;t dress like that, you would make your skirts that little bit shorter?<br> &quot;You&#39;re damn right.&quot; <br><br>Religion is based on fear of women. <br><br>&quot;Fear of everything,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;They try to scare people and scary religion is no religion.&quot; <br><br>So was Dolly&#39;s exaggerated, sexualized look was a giant two fingers to religious misogyny? When church told Dolly about the evil temptation of the flesh and the wicked power women have over men, did she just push her d&eacute;colletage out even further? <br><br>Dolly replies to my religious waffling with the most outrageous flirting. &quot;You are a fascinating person,&quot; she winks. &quot;You are somebody I would love to talk to later but not on a tape recorder.&quot; I wimp out by suggesting I bring my wife along as well. Not only is that is the last I hear of it, but now to all my teenage testosterone comrades, I say sorry. <br><br>There were other reasons why they felt young Dolly Parton was going to burn in the fires of hell. The woman she was most impressed with wasn&#39;t the Virgin Mary, it was the non-virgin local hooker. &quot;She wore real tight clothes and short skirts,&quot; she beams. Parton is now happily babbling away about her beloved town prostitute. &quot;She wore red nail polish, blonde bleached hair, red lipstick and I thought she was the prettiest thing I had ever seen in my life when I was a child. She was real beautiful. Maybe her family didn&#39;t know that she was called the town tramp. She was trash and I thought that is what I want to be when I grow up. Trash.&quot; <br><br>Some on the right of middle America would say she succeeded. Parton&#39;s inspiration from the local hooker was taken to an expected level when, so the tabloid scandal not so long ago alleged, the queen of country music started to carry on like the local hussie and had an affair with a 15-year-old boy when she was 25 and married. To Dolly&#39;s detractors it was a coup de grace for her &#39;open&#39; marriage to her husband of 34 years, Carl Dean. <br><br>&quot;I never deny nor admit everything, but the way that they write that stuff,&quot; she giggles. &quot;It is true that I know the people but it is bullshit that I had an affair with a 12-year-old, 10-year-old or 15. It sounds good. I would like to do it now at my age; I could get away with it. <br><br>I read Parton aloud what her biographer, Alanna Nash, wrote about her: &quot;Dolly certainly acts and talks at times as though her marriage is an open one. She is a love junkie and needs constant comforting and approval.&quot; <br><br>&quot;A crock of shit,&quot; she giggles. There is no bitterness in Dolly, it seems, no malice. &quot;That is just another person&#39;s opinion of me. I love my husband; there is not a man that has been born that could take me away from my husband. I always say yes, I am married but I am not dead and I am not blind. It&#39;s not true that me and my husband sleep with other people anytime we want to.&quot; She looks at me with those overpainted eyes. &quot;You certainly ask mighty personal questions. You&#39;re not going to embarrass me, are you?&quot; Dolly belly-laughs for the millionth time. &quot;Oh you are. I am gonna kill you!&quot; <br><br>As it happens I have just one more personal question. I read her another quote and watch her giggle as I do so. &quot;My husband doesn&#39;t let me date anymore since the story that I dated a 15-year-old boy,&quot; she said a few years ago. &quot;The good thing about age is you do forget about those things. So that if it ever happened I have no memory of it.&quot; Just as I reach the end of the sentence, Parton, all five foot nothing of her, is practically leaping out of the chair with laughter. I feel like I am at a Fifties slumber party, just Dolly and me. &quot;That was a joke! When I say that I was assuming that people just know that was a crock of shit. When I had an affair with a 15-year-old boy they didn&#39;t say it that I was also 15 at the time,&quot; she says. Yes, I played that tape several times and I can&#39;t reconcile this bit with what she said earlier. <br><br>Despite the Prozac-happy theatrical performance on the Shelbourne&#39;s sofa, Parton hasn&#39;t lived a life untouched by sadness. Despite coming from such a large family herself, Dolly never had children. Did she put her career before a family? &quot;I couldn&#39;t have children. I had some problems. Before I knew I couldn&#39;t have children we tried not to for a while and then when we tried to have them we realized we couldn&#39;t have them.&quot; Another unhappy time was after she made the The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas movie in 1982. She sank into a long depression. &quot;I had got overweight and I had a lot of female problems, hormone problems and had a bad period of my life. For 18 months I had a really hard time and I just finally said &#39;Get off your fat ass and move that weight. Get out of this depression or blow your brains out.&quot;&#39; <br><br>You were suicidal? <br><br>&quot;You go through those thoughts,&quot; she says, suddenly not giggling any more. &quot;You can relate to how people get on drugs and alcohol, or how they commit suicide. I didn&#39;t do either but I certainly had a better understanding.&quot; Her father was Republican, her mother a Democrat, there was always, she says, a bunch of fighting in the house about politics. &quot;I was a hypocrite not a democrat,&quot; she chortles. She adds that she was approached to run for governor of Tennessee this past race but was not the least bit interested. &quot;I sure hate politics,&quot; she says in that thick southern belle accent. &quot;I have very strong opinions but I don&#39;t voice them in the papers.&quot; <br><br>She speaks in the patois of a homespun country girl. The hick Tennessee gal act wears a bit thin when you realize that Parton fronts a multi-million dollar media empire, Dolly Parton Enterprises her theme park, Dollywood, is the most popular tourist attraction in her home State. <br><br>And I don&#39;t love her any less for the performance that Friday afternoon in The Shelbourne.

Dolly&#39;s current show revolves around the music to be found on her last three albums, the back-to-her-roots folk and acoustic trio of The Grass Is Blue, Little Sparrow and Halos And Horns. <br><br>&quot;I love the music I do now. It&#39;s from my childhood and deep in my heart. These are the songs I grew up on and they are the ones my Daddy liked to hear me sing the most,&quot; she says with feeling. &quot;It&#39;s in my Smoky Mountain DNA, my psyche, and I expect I&#39;ll be making an album like this every year or so for the rest of my life.&quot; <br><br>But all is not entirely lost, rhinestone fans. Not only has Dolly been devoting a portion of her current show to revamped versions of her eighties-style hits, but she has also said she would feel &quot;isolated and lacking accomplishment if I just did this acoustic music for the rest of my life&quot;. <br><br>&quot;I have a lot of fans in a lot of different areas, so I want to make pop records again, and I want to get played in the clubs, too,&quot; she giggles, with that infectious laugh of hers. <br><br>Speaking of her fans, it can&#39;t possibly have escaped her notice that many of her fans are of the gay persuasion and may, just possibly, not have been entirely attracted by her musical abilities. <br><br>&quot;Lord, no!&quot; she squeals. &quot;I&#39;ve had a big gay following for years because I&#39;m so outrageous in the way that I see life, not just in my appearance! <br><br>&quot;Drag queens fascinate me. I&#39;m really complimented that they think so much about me that they want to dress up like me,&quot; she admits. &quot;Although I have judged a few Dolly lookalike contests, with drag queens dressed up as me, and sometimes it&#39;s been quite a shock, when you see someone who looks like a total dog and you think `Oh my God, is that how I look?&quot; <br><br>There is, it seems, very little that Dolly won&#39;t talk about, and she freely admits to having had a fair few cosmetic makeovers. <br><br>&quot;I do it because I&#39;m a show person. People place such importance on how you look in this business. You are on camera all the time and people expect you to look a certain way. I had my boobs lifted when they started dragging on the floor,&quot; she admits matter-of-factly of her oft-joked-about assets. &quot;Who&#39;d want to look at them if they were like that? <br><br>&quot;I may look fake, but that&#39;s always been my magic,&quot; she concludes. &quot;In fact, I am totally real.&quot; <br><br><b>Dolly Parton is at The Bridgewater Hall on Friday, November 15.</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Times Magazine</font><br><font size="2">November 2, 2002</font><br><br><font size="1"><b>Ginny Dougary meets Dolly Parton and discovers that beneath the fluffy facade lurks a shrewd businesswoman who&#39;s as tough as old cowgirl boots</b></font></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="The Times Magazine" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Times Magazine" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton&#39;s bosom goes before her. It is impossible to think of her voice and her songs without conjuring a mental picture of that famous cantilevered shelf which juts so implausibly over her minuscule waist. Her top-heavy form even enlivened debate in the House of Commons when some years ago Kenneth Clarke chastised Gordon Brown for relying on the &quot;Dolly Parton school of economics, an unbelievable figure blown out of all proportion with no visible means of support.&quot; <br><br>If it seems unseemly to linger on a person&#39;s poitrine in this way then it must be said that no man or woman has more boldly gone into this territory than Parton herself. Reading past encounters with journalists, mostly male, it is she rather than her interviewers who nudges the subject back to her breasts again and again. Dolly&#39;s bust, she makes it clear, is up for grabs. There has been much speculation in the press over the decades as to the secret of her bosom&#39;s buoyancy: exactly how much silicone has been pumped into those mamas? She has never denied that she is partially plastic but she won&#39;t be drawn on the detail. When one persistent fellow pressed her for specifics, she said: &quot;Look, I&#39;m in show-business. I look at my boobs like they&#39;re showhorses or showdogs. You&#39;ve got to keep &#39;em groomed.&quot; <br><br>Emboldened by Parton&#39;s own approach to her body, I had convinced myself that it would be a dereliction of journalistic duty not to ask her if I could briefly touch her, ahem, breasts. The readers of <i>The Times</i> surely had a right to know what such significant assets in the Parton empire felt like. But, alas, when it came to it I chickened out...partly because in the flesh, despite appearances to the contrary, there is nothing remotely fluffy about Dolly. <br><br>A big heart may be beating under her big chest but Parton is also a tough cookie and steely in her determination to run the show precisely to her specifications. If you attempt to steer her into uncharted waters, she makes her disapproval very plain. The version of herself that she is prepared to offer has been carefully honed over the years, the teasing paradox of the God-loving &quot;toilet-mouthed&quot; sinner; the woman who has been apparently happily married to her teenage sweetheart, Carl, for 36 years (they met outside the Wishy-Washy Laundromat in Nashville) who has neither confirmed or denied rumours of her affairs with men and women over the years; the simple country girl who is an extremely shrewd businesswoman, an owner of five houses as well as various enterprises including a radio station, a brand of cosmetics, a lucrative theme park in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, Dollywood, and a Hollywood film and television production company. <br><br>One of Parton&#39;s much-quoted lines is that she looks like a woman but thinks like a man. &quot;You know, there are many women who think good,&quot; she tells me. &quot;I just mean that you would be foolish as a man to underestimate me.&quot; Plenty of men have been fooled by her appearance which has doubtless been good news for the Dolly dollar: &quot;It&#39;s worked for me because I&#39;ve got the deal done and gone before a lot of people have got past looking at the boobs or the hair.&quot; <br><br>She makes no bones about the importance of being in control of her business affairs, and I wonder whether Parton would go so far as to say she was a control freak. &quot;No, I&#39;m not a control freak but I&#39;m very alert and very aware of my things. I have to take care of my things my way,&quot; she says, sounding very southern indeed, with her mah&#39;s (for my&#39;s) and ah&#39;m (for I&#39;m) and swooping high-speed delivery. &quot;I&#39;m a very professional Dolly Parton. I don&#39;t try to run other people&#39;s lives but I know what I want, what I don&#39;t want, what I will do, what I won&#39;t do and I think it&#39;s important for people to take care of that part of things themselves. And I don&#39;t care if I&#39;d been born a man or a woman or both.&quot; <br><br>When I visited Dollywood two years ago (of which more later), I was told by one of Parton&#39;s assistants there that her boss&#39;s days often started as early as six in the morning and ended late at night, with every minute in between accounted for. Like presidents and Hollywood stars, Parton keeps her interviews short and to the point, treating herself as a rare commodity to be sampled at arm&#39;s length by outsiders, and only with limited access. The briefer the encounter, of course, the easier it is for her to keep the conversation within the boundaries which suit her. She is happy projecting a contained provocativeness (four-letter words, a relish for sex), which may be bold and shocking in her hometown of Pigeon Forge, dominated by hellfire Baptists obsessed with sin, but she is not prepared to be controversial in a broader context. <br><br>I come close to offending her, for instance, when I broach the subject of politics. &quot;I&#39;ll talk about sex and God but I ain&#39;t talkin&#39; about politics,&quot; Parton says firmly. So I can&#39;t talk to you about America and Iraq? &quot;No, you cannot.&quot; She says that she definitely has her opinions, which I don&#39;t doubt for a minute, but she doesn&#39;t even care to discuss politics or religion with her friends because those discussions can very soon turn into arguments. And being in the limelight herself: &quot;I don&#39;t voice my opinions about those things because people take it out of context. Especially journalists. You say one thing, next thing you know it&#39;s plastered all over the page and taken out of context: &#39;Dolly said this&#39;. I just wish we all got along. I wish the world was perfect, but it is not.&quot; <br><br>Dolly&#39;s world-view is this: &quot;If we were more God-loving, God-like, Christ-like people, we wouldn&#39;t be having the problems we do. But we&#39;re having them because nobody will forgive, nobody will love, we&#39;re all so selfish and just get into our own little place of what is right and what is wrong and so we&#39;re all just screwing up big time.&quot; These sentiments are echoed in several of the songs, <i>Hello God</i>, <i>Raven Dove</i>, on her new record <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, the fourth back-to-bluegrass album Parton has released in the past four years. This return to the unadorned acoustic music of Parton&#39;s mountain roots, fiddle, banjo, snare-drum, washboard, tambourine and goosebump-inducing harmonies, has given her career a new lease of life, happily coinciding with the post-<i>O Brother Where Art Thou</i> hipness of bluegrass (her first album in this vein, as she points out, came out before the film), and prompting her to form a new band, the Blueniques, made up largely of Pigeon Forge recruits, and go back to touring. For die-hard Dolly fans like myself, it is incredible to think that she hasn&#39;t performed a concert in this country for 20 years. <br><br>&quot;It takes a lot of money to look this cheap&quot; is one of Dolly&#39;s favourite Dollyisms, along with, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t been a woman I&#39;d have been a drag queen.&quot; She based her look, she has said, on a local prostitute who stood out from the rest of the drably dressed, careworn women in the community with her yellow hair, red nails and lipstick. For our interview, however, Parton looks comparatively sober, almost tasteful, in a little charcoal grey skirt and matching monochrome sweater, a V-neck revealing only a glimpse of pale cleavage, flesh-coloured nylons and high-heels. Most of the time, she tucks her pointed feet underneath her bottom on the sofa. <br><br>There&#39;s the same wig of teased hair but close-up, obviously, really, since she&#39;s a 56-year-old woman, her face does not have the dewy, youthful glow of her photographs in which even recently she looks like a gorgeous tarnished angel. The Annie Leibovitz snaps on the sleeve of the new album are a case in point and among the best of Parton I&#39;ve ever seen: tatty, faded denim shirt, blue jeans, and the sort of understated make-up which takes at least three hours to apply. <br><br>The singer&#39;s husband, Carl Dean, has always come across as a mystery man in the press, principally because he has rarely been sighted in public. They met the day Dolly arrived in Nashville; she was 18, he was 21, and they married two years later. I must say that I do like the detail of the Wishy-Washy Laundromat: &quot;Well, I was doing my dirty laundry that I&#39;d brought from home, you know having graduated the night before, because I was in such a hurry to get to Nashville and be a star. <br><br>&quot;Carl had just finished work, he and his father owned an asphalt paving company, and he had gone home and cleaned up and he was just driving around...looking for me, he said. And he must have.&quot; Her voice does a fabulous loop-the-loop, <i>he-yyyyyy-uhv</i>. &quot;He was very shy and bashful and that&#39;s not like him. So that&#39;s another way I believe God has purpose for people. <br><br>&quot;Of course, I was tiny and I was blonde, for sure, had that hair all hiked up and I had on a red rib-tickler halter top and my little hip-hugger red pants and I guess he just looked and thought, &#39;I&#39;m gonna say something to her.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Do you remember what he said? &quot;Well, yeah, I know exactly what he said. He just pulled up to the sidewalk and said, &#39;You&#39;re gonna get sunburnt out here, little lady.&#39; And I said, &#39;Oh, you think?&#39; And so we just started talking and that was that.&quot; <br><br>She says that her husband loves music and is forever whistling and singing around the house and the barn &quot;in a kind of pop sounding voice&quot;. He has a large record collection and is a great Led Zeppelin fan, which was one of the reasons why she did her own version of <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> on <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> &quot;because I&#39;d heard that song in the house a million times&quot;. I think it&#39;s by far the most exciting track on the CD, and really beautiful, full-blown and delicate at the same time, building up to a great choral swell of celestial female voices at the end. <br><br>And what was Carl&#39;s reaction? &quot;&#39;Only you&#39;d have the nerve to do that damn song that way!&#39; You know, he doesn&#39;t say it&#39;s good or bad. He just says, &#39;Well, it&#39;s different, I&#39;ll give you that.&#39; Yeah, that&#39;s about all he says.&quot; <br><br>Is he a loner? &quot;Very much a loner. But he&#39;s friendly. He&#39;s funny. He does have a handful of very good friends but they&#39;re mostly people that he went to school with.&quot; <br><br>I had gone to Dollywood in the summer of 2000 in the hope of talking to Parton, who was scheduled to be there. The interview had been agreed, after questions had been asked about <i>The Times</i> (&quot;Was it a tabloid?&quot; &quot;Was it a new paper?&quot; &quot;What was its circulation?&quot;), but after a great deal of shilly-shallying about how many minutes I would be given, Dolly&#39;s people cancelled. I decided to go anyway, and thought that if I approached Parton after her press conference to launch her new water park, Dolly&#39;s Splash Country, she might relent. Not a bit of it. There was no hobnobbing with the locals at the reception, no pressing of flesh, or bestowing of gracious smiles. This was a glimpse of the &quot;very professional Dolly Parton&quot;. She came, she went, she vanished and although you can be sure I pestered her manager, Ted Miller, for at least an introduction having come so far, none was forthcoming. Dolly had a toothache, it was explained. And, besides, she was only interested in local journalists for this story. <br><br>Still my time there was not without its diversions. Her appearance was sensational, to say the least. The local press and dignitories were sealed off behind a cord waiting for Dolly to say the word so that the bulldozer could start the ground-breaking ceremony. We had watched her blonde head approach us, poking out of the top of an army tank as it made its stately progress up an interminable dirt track while <i>Islands in the Stream</i> crackled in and out of the loudspeaker system. <br><br>She was helped out of the vehicle by a half-a-dozen butch lifesavers, and there was an appreciative murmur as she asked coquettishly: &quot;So howdy&#39;all like mah wet suit?&quot; Lady Penelope meets dominatrix scuba diver, I wrote down on my notepad. I was amazed by how filthy she was, which possibly explains why she and Graham Norton hit it off so well. (Norton went to Dollywood to film a Christmas special last year.) All the attractions, she explained, were based on places that were important to her as a child: &quot;Like the Suck Hole but I don&#39;t think with mah reputation we should call it that!&quot; She screamed with laughter. She brought up a story which had appeared in the <i>National Enquirer</i> about her alleged dalliance with a 15-year-old boy: &quot;It&#39;s not true, unfortunately. I wish it was,&quot; she said mock-wistfully. &quot;Sounds fun!&quot; And then she was gone. <br><br>I was impressed by Dollywood itself. Having expected to enjoy it in an ironic &quot;Isn&#39;t it kitsch?&quot; way, it was far better than that, with none of the plastic unpleasantness of mainstream theme parks. In Craftsman&#39;s Valley, blacksmiths, soap-makers, woodcarvers and coopers were hard at work. The food all smelt delicious: wholesome, authentic home-cooked ham and beans and grits. The children&#39;s area was a splendidly inventive Professor Branestawm interactive paradise. There&#39;s a replica of the two-room newspaper-lined log cabin Dolly and her 11 brothers and sisters grew up in, and many spangly frocks in the Rags to Riches Museum. And, naturally, you can hear every sort of music from country to gospel to Fifties rock&#39;n&#39;roll...although one of Dolly&#39;s brothers, Randy, who does a sort of gospel meets <i>Blues Brothers</i> gig would probably not be drawing crowds where it not for his sister&#39;s patronage. <br><br>I went on the Imagination Express, a brightly painted vehicle designed to look like a train, for a storytelling session at a local infant school down a long, winding road. This was part of Parton&#39;s literacy programme, the Dollywood Foundation, through which every child in Sevier County, where the singer was born, receives a new book every month from birth to the age of five. I was given <i>Madeleine in Paris</i> to read to the children by Parton&#39;s jolly assistants, Karen and Doreen, since my suggestion of Harry Potter had been rejected. (The book had recently been banned in a couple of southern states on the grounds that J. K. Rowling was promoting sorcery.) That evening, I went to The Dixie Belle Saloon and drank nasty sweet non-alcoholic cocktails out of a plastic drinking vessel in the shape of a boot. The county is dry, and being America there was no smoking. And although the cocktail waitresses were trussed up to look like old-fashioned whores (frilly knickers, plunging necklines), it would, of course, be a sin for gentlemen to harbour <br>impure thoughts about them, even if those thoughts only did remain in the mind. <br><br>What is intriguing is how Parton reconciles her robust appetites with her Godliness, particularly given her severe Baptist upbringing. For a true Holy-Roller doesn&#39;t just believe that sex is sinful &mdash; it&#39;s also a sin to dance or drink or have any kind of fun. As her fire-and-brimstone preacher grandfather used to tell her: &quot;A dancing foot and a praying knee don&#39;t fit on the same leg.&quot; And she used to think: &quot;&#39;Well, why not?&#39; Because I believed in making a joyful noise and rejoicin&#39;.&quot; <br><br>Even as a child, the young Dolly was a determinedly free spirit so she simply remoulded her God into a more accommodating form: &quot;I didn&#39;t want to worship a God that I felt was vengeful and scary. I mean those preachers, and not just my grandpa, they would scream at you, and threaten you, and yell at you, &#39;If you go out of this church unprepared and get killed on the way home, you&#39;re gonna go straight to hell&#39;...that used to scare me to death.&quot; <br><br>So she would take off on her own and have her own conversations with God in an abandoned church and &quot;try to reason with him a little bit find him in a softer way&quot;. One morning, when she was nine years old, she had such a feeling of profound light-heartedness as the empty room flooded with sunshine that she believed herself to be &quot;saved&quot;. She skipped down the street telling everyone she met that she was on her way to paradise and insisted on being baptised there and then...&quot;So I made my communication with God in my way and he&#39;s always dealt with me according to how I can accept him in my own heart and in my own emotions and in my own mind.&quot; <br><br>On <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> there&#39;s a jaunty-sounding song called <i>Shattered Image</i> which Parton wrote and recorded in 1976 in response to one of the first tabloid stories about her love life. It uses the image from her childhood of her throwing stones into the river to shatter her watery reflection, and then fast-forwards to the present: &quot;I&#39;m far from perfect, but I ain&#39;t all bad/It hurts me more than it makes me mad/You gather your stones by stooping so low/Then shatter my image with the stones you throw.&quot; <br><br>She says she dragged the song out again because of more stories in the press about her alleged 19-year affair with an improbably named singer-songwriter called Blaise Tosti. He claims that Parton seduced him when he was 13 years old: &quot;That&#39;s bullshit. I know the people. We used to go to the house and feed the family because they were poor and the boy&#39;s mother was an alcoholic. He was a kid then, I was young also and I had just gotten married and brought down my own brothers and sisters to raise them. (One of the reasons she has cited for never having had children of her own.) And he was a great singer and a great writer and I worked with him. But, you know, people turn on you and are desperate for money so they do stuff and it does hurt.&quot; <br><br>There has always been speculation about the precise nature of Parton&#39;s relationships with her leading men, from the man she first sang with, Porter Wagoner, through to co-stars in various movies, such as Burt Lancaster. She&#39;s an open book on this, just as long as you don&#39;t attempt to turn the page yourself. So she will spin an impression to me of herself as a free agent: &quot;Even if I was having an affair with someone, you don&#39;t like to hear people talking about it...all people are capable of anything and I&#39;m no angel...I&#39;ve not done all the stuff that I&#39;ve been accused of, but I have done a lot of stuff that nobody&#39;s found out yet...&quot; But if she suspects that you are angling for more information, she will slap you down: &quot;I&#39;m not here to tell you everything about myself. You have no right to know that any more than somebody else. But I&#39;ll tell you all I can. I&#39;ll tell you all I will [weee-youl],&quot; her voice goes up. &quot;And you can guess the rest.&quot; <br><br>My question had been, simply, whether she thought her God was an unjudgmental one, particularly as regards sex. &quot;Well, how can sex be wrong?&quot; she says, after subjecting me to her mild knuckle-rapping. &quot;I have no problem with sex. I have no hang-ups about sex. I enjoy sex. And if that&#39;s a sin, well, then somebody else will have to punish me and if God decides to...and, you know, I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m right, I may be the first person he punishes, I may be burning in hell tomorrow...but if it&#39;s wrong, as much faith as I have in God, I would just ask him to take the whole desire from me. You can make anything a sin. It&#39;s all in how you deal with it. If you believe it&#39;s a sin, if you feel it&#39;s a sin, then it is a sin.&quot; <br><br>Parton has not always felt this unmuddled and forthright. In her forties, she suffered from a serious depression for 18 months. She was 50lb heavier than her ideal weight, which ballooned over three or four years, she had mood swings, gynaecological and personal problems: &quot;Never between me and Carl...that was always fine, thank God.&quot; She hated herself and felt despairing enough to think about suicide. You didn&#39;t! I say, shocked that such an indomitable force could have been so derailed. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything, let me finish telling you,&quot; Parton says, crossly. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just saying that when you get into those places, you really realise how people get on drugs and how they would commit suicide because you really don&#39;t want to live and it&#39;s like you&#39;re waking up dead every day. And one night, I was thinking: &#39;Do you know what? I&#39;m just lying here wallowing in my fat, wallowing in my misery, and it&#39;s either do something about it, git off your fat ass and git on a diet, or shut the hell up.&#39; And I said to God, &#39;You either get my ass out of this mood, show me a way, help me, or I&#39;m ending it. Even if committing suicide is a sin, I&#39;ll just burn in hell.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Fortunately for us, God came up trumps, Dolly went on a diet, sorted out her hormones, and went though a whole emotional, spiritual and professional rejuvenation. When I point out how unexpected is this glimpse of a darker Dolly, even though a fair number of her songs, and she has, incredibly, written more than 3,000, deal with heartbreak and despair, she says: &quot;I am cheerful and optimistic but people also forget that people like me are not mannequins, we&#39;re not plastic dolls; even if we&#39;ve got plastic parts, the heart ain&#39;t plastic, the mind ain&#39;t plastic. People think that just because you&#39;re a star and because you&#39;ve got a big smile that you never suffer, you never hurt. But people like me are the ones that hurt most because we&#39;re the ones that leave ourselves wide open in order to be able to write. To be sensitive enough to pick up on everybody&#39;s sorrow as well as your own, you have to leave yourself wide open. And I don&#39;t know how to do anything just a little. Same with food. If I want to eat, I want to eat the whole thing. If I&#39;m gonna love you, I&#39;m gonna love you to death. If my heart gets broken it&#39;s gonna shatter. And you know, it&#39;s just the whole thing. That&#39;s the kind of person I am.&quot; <br><br><i>Dolly Parton&#39;s new album</i> Halos &amp; Horns <i>is on release.

For an alternative list of attributes, try bust of a glamour model, hair of a Barbie doll and nature of a saint. <br><br>Country&rsquo;s first showbiz superstar would be happy to embrace both appraisals. The 56-year-old rhinestone-encrusted icon is comfortable with all facets of her appeal and appears to delight in all her achievements, whether it be her recent return to her bluegrass roots, her film-star turns in 9 To 5 and Steel Magnolias, or the tacky tourist confection of Dollywood, her fairytale Tennessee theme park which attracts two million visitors - and Graham Norton - every year. &quot;I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes in the minds of some people but I&rsquo;ve made few, if any, in my own mind,&quot; she remarks. <br><br>Her ridiculously broad fan base, from country purists to drag queens, would agree with such trenchant self-belief. RuPaul would fall over his stack heels for some grooming tips from Dolly. Sinead O&rsquo;Connor and the White Stripes, who covered the plaintive Jolene, are ardent fans. Shania Twain finally got to meet her heroine at this year&rsquo;s Country Music Awards. And if insistent internet reports are to be believed, Saddam Hussein used Whitney Houston&rsquo;s version of Parton&rsquo;s I Will Always Love You - top of VH1&rsquo;s recent 100 Greatest Love Songs poll - as his campaign song in the recent Iraqi election. Now that lot would make some celebrity guest list for An Audience With Dolly. <br><br>Ticket demand for her first UK tour in 19 years has been sky-high. But it has taken a string of acclaimed bluegrass albums to get her back on the road. A decade ago the rise of new country pushed the diminutive diva off the radio playlists for a time and, fearing that her fan base may have dissipated, she laid off touring, confining herself to occasional appearances at Dollywood. She didn&rsquo;t need the cash anyway - Whitney&rsquo;s global hit had earned her $6 million in royalties, to which her self-mocking response was &quot;it costs a lot of money to look this cheap&quot;. <br><br>Now, in the words of her 1998 album, she is Hungry Again. The massive success of the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack revived public interest in bluegrass and inspired Parton to revert to the mountain music she grew up with. Once again, she has surprised her audience with the stripped-back sound and stark emotion of the Grammy-winning albums The Grass Is Blue and Little Sparrow and her 72nd album Halos And Horns, released earlier this year. <br><br>&quot;I take more pride in my songwriting than anything else,&quot; she says. &quot;If I could do but one thing in show business, it would be to write songs. I love to sing and perform but I get more personal satisfaction by leaving something in the world that wasn&rsquo;t there the day before.&quot; <br><br>Do fans give a darn about this new credibility? Hell, no. That she is a terrific songwriter is already a given. Dolly is equally and deservedly loved for her homely wisdom, perpetually sunny outlook and her brassy, trashy image, which she allegedly modeled on the prostitutes in her hometown and &quot;a country girl&rsquo;s idea of what glamour is&quot;. She adds: &quot;I can look like a whore but I can sing like an angel - that&rsquo;s where Halos and Horns comes from,&quot; she says. &quot;I&rsquo;ve made it hard on myself looking the way I look and loving the music like I do. At first glance, people look at me as just hair and tits and a big mouth. Well, I know that and I am that. But I am so much more than that. I look so totally artificial but am so totally real.&quot; <br><br>Her early life could have come straight from the pages of a Country &amp; Western songbook. Dolly Rebecca Parton was the fourth of 12 children born to Scots/Irish sharecropper Robert and his half-Cherokee wife Avie Lee, and brought up in extreme poverty in eastern Tennessee&rsquo;s Smoky Mountains. Parton recalls being scorned for her patched clothes, as documented in her early hit Coat Of Many Colours. In a catalogue of more than 3,000 published songs, that one remains her favourite, simultaneously reminding her of her background and of the talent that was to be her get-out clause. <br><br>&quot;Seems like you gotta get rich to sing like you&rsquo;re poor again,&quot; she has remarked. But rather than going back to her roots, Parton maintains she has never left them. As soon as she had made enough money from music, she bought and restored her old family home in Locust Ridge in order to live there. She then purchased the local store and church, creating her own backwoods theme village retreat. Locust Ridge has become the private flipside to the kitsch and glitz of Dollywood, which she also founded to celebrate her Smoky Mountains roots. Such apparently guileless attachment to the old homestead when she could have settled in industry epicentre Nashville, or the airbrushed pavilions of LA, only cements her charm. <br><br>In the mid-1960s, Nashville was the only destination for an aspirant country singer. Parton, who had been performing since the age of ten and already had an unsuccessful record deal under her belt, arrived there, penniless, the day after her high school graduation. <br><br>Her break came in 1967, when country star Porter Wagoner chose her as his female sidekick on his TV show. They had a string of hit duets before Parton went solo and supernova in the early 1970s. Wagoner felt slighted but Dolly preserved their legacy by writing I Will Always Love You about her mentor. The rags-to-riches transformation was complete. <br><br>Where her story diverges from traditional country melodrama is that Parton has been lucky in love. For all her coquettish ways, Dolly has stood by her man, contractor Carl Dean, ever since they met in a Laundromat on her first night in Nashville 36 years ago. He is something of an enigma, having never made a public appearance with his wife and, perhaps even more surprisingly, taking no part in her numerous business ventures, which include a chain of restaurants (called Dixie Stampede), her own line of wigs and a literacy programme - Dolly Parton&rsquo;s Imagination Library (ain&rsquo;t it cute?) - for young children. Again, there is a connection with her beloved roots - Parton&rsquo;s father was illiterate. <br><br>Her iconic allure was never really in doubt but, artistically, Parton now feels firmly back in the saddle. Her new single, the 11 September-inspired Hello God, is closer to her familiar country pop style than her bluegrass material but, for all its traditional sound, it makes a more reflective response to global conflict than Toby Keith&rsquo;s patriotic, chest-beating Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue. Plans are also underway for a Dolly tribute album, with Shania already queuing up to cover Coat Of Many Colours. <br><br>She has also continued her sporadic film career with a role in Disney feature Frank McKlusky C I and has finally fulfilled her ambition to play Mae West, that other beloved buxom blonde broad, for a forthcoming TV movie. Her other objective - to pose nude for Penthouse to mark her 100th birthday - remains some way off.<br> With all this fresh creative activity, someone should name her Tennessee&rsquo;s ambassador for film and music. Actually, the state governor already has, saying: &quot;Dolly exemplifies the total spectrum of Tennessee&rsquo;s extraordinary talent.&quot; <br><br>Or, in Dolly&rsquo;s words: &quot;If I haven&rsquo;t done it, I&rsquo;m capable of doing it. I just ain&rsquo;t got around to it.&quot; <br><br><i>Dolly Parton plays the Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow, on 26 and 27 November.</i></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Sunday Herald</font><br><font size="2">November 24, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Rhinestone cowgirl</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>She&#39;s the glitzy first lady of country music, she snubbed Elvis Presley, and now after a gap of ten years Dolly Parton takes to the road again to bring the music of her childhood back into focus, says Nigel Williamson</b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Sunday Herald" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Sunday Herald" width="455"></div><br><br>NINE thirty on a scorching autumn Saturday morning, and Dolly Parton is dressed up to the nines. While the rest of New York City relaxes for the weekend in T-shirts and baggy sweat pants, she&#39;s wearing a tiny polka-dot micro-skirt, high-heels and a revealingly low-cut top, offset by dangling earrings, unbelievably long crimson-painted nails, a blonde wig and elaborate make-up which she must have been up at dawn to apply. <br><br>As she likes to boast, it takes a lot of money to make her look so cheap. &#39;Even if I weren&#39;t a singer, I&#39;d still look this way,&#39; she laughs. &#39;However much I spend and however many expensive designers I employ, it always ends up looking cheap and tasteless. But then I&#39;d hate to look matronly and boring.&#39; <br><br>There&#39;s little danger of that. In the flesh she&#39;s an even more improbable figure than she appears in her pictures. The legs, which she is forever crossing and uncrossing, are bird thin. Her waist can&#39;t be more than a size eight and the legendary superstructure is indeed remarkable. You can&#39;t help remembering former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke&#39;s joke in suggesting Gordon Brown&#39;s budget proposals were drawn from the Dolly Parton school of economics, &#39;an unbelievable figure blown out of all proportion with no visible means of support&#39;. <br><br>At 56, Parton is currently in the middle of an astonishing career renaissance. Over the past three years she&#39;s made a trilogy of critically acclaimed albums on which she has returned to the acoustic, roots-based music of her Tennessee mountain childhood, far removed from the glossy country-pop of such current Nashville heroines as Shania Twain and Faith Hill. She&#39;s touring for the first time in ten years. This week in Glasgow she will play her first British dates since 1984. <br><br>&#39;Renaissance would be a fair word, I think,&#39; she says in the trademark Tennessee drawl. &#39;I wasn&#39;t getting on the radio any more. Nobody was interested in me as an artist any more. When you&#39;re over 35 they think you&#39;re too old in modern music. I couldn&#39;t even get a record deal.&#39; <br><br>Her response was to forget about sounding commercial and fashionable, return to her roots and record the traditional kind of country and bluegrass music she loves. &#39;I&#39;ve been in the business a long time and won all the awards and had a lot of success. But I was still hungry to be an artist,&#39; she says. &#39;I was missing having an outlet for my music. So I thought I&#39;m going to record these songs on my own, pay for them myself and then lease them to a record company.&#39; <br><br>Her timing was immaculate, as the return to her roots has coincided with the revival of interest in old-time country music created by the spectacular success of the soundtrack of the Coen Brothers&#39; film, O Brother Where Art Thou? American country radio stations also refused to play that record&#39;s mix of bluegrass and mountain music, but the CD went on to win a Grammy as album of the year and sell five million copies. <br><br>She has her own theory about the renewed popularity of such music. &#39;We live in such a high-tech world. That&#39;s progress, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. We&#39;re into the future and we&#39;re stuck with it,&#39; she reasons. &#39;But I think people are longing for simplicity and realism. People want to believe they&#39;re part of something that has a tradition. There&#39;s an honesty to this music, and it&#39;s not cluttered up with technology. We&#39;re always going to have human feelings &mdash; and so much of this music speaks to that. It takes people back to a more honest place or makes them homesick for some place they&#39;ve actually never been.&#39; <br><br>Parton says she now feels she&#39;s on a mission to promote and propagate old-time country music. &#39;I feel like I&#39;m able to teach people. It&#39;s my ministry. It&#39;s something I preach and live and know. This is a really good time in my life because I feel needed. People want to know about this old music and how it started. And I can tell them.&#39; <br><br>Although she&#39;s now associated with the big hair and rhinestones and glitz and glamour of modern Nashville, Parton grew up in another world. Born into a family of 12 brothers and sisters in the Smoky Mountains, her share-cropping father couldn&#39;t read or write and her family was dirt poor. The cabin that was the family home had no electricity, running water or a telephone, and the children were dressed in a succession of hand-me down clothes. <br><br>But she learned to love music and on the day Parton graduated from high school in 1964, she grabbed a suitcase full of clothes and headed for Nashville. What followed was a classic rags-to-riches story. First as a singing duet with Porter Wagoner and then on her own, she became not only country music&#39;s biggest star but a larger-than-life icon whose image is recognised and loved around the world. She&#39;s also one of the world&#39;s most prolific songwriters. Jolene, Coat Of Many Colours, My Tennessee Mountain Home, Nine To Five, Here She Comes Again, and, of course, I Will Always Love You all came from her own pen. &#39;I&#39;ve written so many thousands of songs there&#39;s bound to be a few good ones,&#39; she says with only a touch of false modesty. <br><br>As someone who makes their living interviewing celebrities, I have never been asked to get the autograph of any of the stars I meet. Until, that is, I interview Dolly Parton. Three of the most unlikely people, including an elderly aunt and a doctor, sheepishly asked if I might ask her to sign something for them. I tell her this to her evident delight and ask how she explains the breadth of her appeal. <br><br>The answer is refreshingly honest. &#39;A lot of people get a kick out of my big mouth and the big outrageous personality. And some people relate to me because I look like trash with the big tits and the big hair. People know how serious I am about my music and family and my roots and God and my spiritual side. People appreciate that I was brought up in the mountains, as poor as anybody could be and still survived. So I come in all kinds of colours. A lot of people understand that I look totally artificial but actually I am totally real.&#39; <br><br>Paradoxical as it may sound, there is something in this. For almost everything about Parton, from the not-so-cheap trashy glamour of the way she looks to her noted business acumen, has its origins deep in her poverty-stricken childhood. Her explanation of how she developed her image is so eloquent and gripping that after hearing it you resolve never to laugh again at the way she looks, no matter how preposterous. <br><br>&#39;It came from a poor country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour was,&#39; she explains. &#39;I grew up in a very religious family where it was a sin to shave your legs or pluck your eyebrows and you weren&#39;t allowed to dance. And everything that wasn&#39;t allowed was the very thing I wanted to do. I don&#39;t think I was doing it to rebel. It was just stuff that a young person wants to do. You want to dance and you want to be pretty.&#39; <br><br>And, as she puts it, &#39;when you&#39;re poor and you&#39;re country and you have no sense of taste or style or anyone to teach you, then you find role models wherever you can.&#39; In Parton&#39;s case, this was the local town prostitute. &#39;At least that&#39;s what all the other women called her. She had peroxide yellow hair and she had it sprayed and teased, she wore red lipstick and red nail polish and high heel shoes and short skirts. And I used to see her as a child when we went into town and I thought she was the prettiest thing I&#39;d ever seen.&#39; <br><br>When Parton said she thought she was beautiful, her mother would reply &#39;she&#39;s just trash&#39;. &#39;So in my mind I decided I wanted to grow up to be trash, too. I was fighting my family and they said I was going straight to hell, but it suited me just fine. I didn&#39;t do it to get in trouble, although I usually did. I did it because I wanted to feel pretty and dressing like that made me feel pretty. And to this day I guess I don&#39;t feel good unless I look cheap.&#39; <br><br>She laughs loudly. Parton&#39;s ability not to take herself too seriously is one of her most endearing qualities. But she&#39;s deadly serious about her money and its prudent investment, an attitude inherited from her father. Watching him raise 12 kids on next-to-nothing taught her &#39;the value of a dollar&#39;. She has invested in television and film production companies, but her biggest success has been the Dollywood theme park in East Tennessee. Far from being some self-indulgent monument to her own vanity, it was established on hard-headed business principles, namely that the Smoky Mountain National Park has 10 million visitors a year. <br><br>&#39;It wasn&#39;t hard to realise a theme park might do well there. I&#39;ve got all this money and I can waste it on clothes and wigs and push-up bras and high-heel shoes, or I can keep some to invest in business stuff,&#39; she says. &#39;Dollywood has been open 17 years and every year more people come and we make millions of dollars through there for the whole community.&#39; <br><br>Another story which illustrates her marriage of principle and business sense is her refusal to allow Elvis Presley to sing her I Will Always Love You. Long before Whitney Houston, Presley wanted to record the song, but as was his usual practice, demanded half of the songwriting credit and the publishing royalties. Most songwriters were so flattered that they readily agreed. For Parton, too, having Elvis sing one of her songs &#39;would have been next to God singing it&#39;. But she stubbornly refused to give up half of the credit to someone who had no hand in the song&#39;s composition. &#39;And so he didn&#39;t sing it and I cried all night,&#39; she confesses. And yet she had the last laugh, for when Houston recorded it several years later, Parton earned six million dollars from the song. If she&#39;d agreed to Presley&#39;s demands, his estate would have received half of the proceeds. &#39;But I&#39;d still love to have heard him sing it. Wouldn&#39;t you?&#39; she asks wistfully. <br><br>In a business littered with divorces, Parton is proud that she is still married to Carl, her husband of 36 years standing, who she met on her first day in Nashville in 1964. &#39;He&#39;s very independent, and when I&#39;m away working that&#39;s fine for him because he loves his solitude,&#39; she says. &#39;He&#39;s not in the music business, and that&#39;s what has saved us.&#39; <br><br>They never had children, which Parton says she doesn&#39;t regret. They&#39;d planned for them and even discussed names but it never happened. Instead, they took in five of her younger brothers and sisters. &#39;We raised them and sent them to school. And then I started taking birth control pills because we had a house full of kids and I had my career. And next thing I was too old.&#39; The siblings she raised now have their own children, who call her &#39;Aunt Granny&#39;, and she appears content with that. &#39;We have all these kids and grandchildren and we take them everywhere and send them to college and buy them cars when they graduate and we treat them just like we would our own children,&#39; she says. <br><br>Parton lives in Nashville but has also bought and renovated the old family cabin in the Smoky Mountains, the very one she sang about in My Old Tennessee Mountain Home. &#39;I&#39;ve fixed it up just like it was when I was growing up. I spent a couple of million dollars making it look like a $100 place,&#39; she jokes. She has made some concessions to modernity by introducing electricity and plumbing &#39;but the bath tubs are made to look like old horse troughs and the commodes look like old outdoor toilets with wooden doors.&#39; Like her own private movie set, she&#39;s also constructed around the house a general store, a chapel and an old school house &#39;all created out of my childhood memories and dreams&#39;. <br><br>It is here she goes to write her songs, &#39;up in the mountains and creeks I knew as a child&#39;. And when the wigs and the outrageous clothes have finally been hung up for the last time, it&#39;s as a songwriter that Parton would like to be best remembered. <br><br>&#39;You&#39;re putting something in the world that wasn&#39;t there yesterday and people are going to sing after you&#39;ve gone. If nobody even knows what you looked like or who you were, you&#39;ve left something there for other people. The songs are like my children.&#39; She pauses for effect and laughs as she remembers just how much money I Will Always Love You has made. &#39;And I expect them to support me when I grow old.&#39; <br><br>Dolly Parton plays the Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow on Tuesday and Wednesday.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Knoxville News-Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">December 14, 2002</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Indian youngsters benefit from Dolly&#39;s love of books</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Parton&#39;s library program going onto reservations</b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE, Dolly Parton, who has added literacy advocate to her list of credits, has often wondered why she stayed in school. <br><br>She didn&#39;t enjoy it. She&#39;s written songs about how she was taunted for being poor. No one else in her household at the time went. Her father couldn&#39;t read or write. <br><br>If she decided she didn&#39;t want to go, then certainly no one in her family would have tried to make her. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know why I stayed,&quot; she said Friday during an interview. <br><br>Since 1995 Parton&#39;s philanthropic work has included ways to get children to become interested in learning and staying in school. <br><br>On Friday she announced a partnership between her Dollywood Foundation and the federal government in which they&#39;ll distribute books once a month to American Indian preschoolers primarily living on reservations. <br><br>As part of the foundation&#39;s Imagination Library program, the books will be free to the families and will be delivered until children reach age 5. <br><br>American Indians have some of the lowest proficiency rates and highest dropout numbers among minorities in the United States. <br><br>The foundation began its Imagination Library in 1995 in Sevier County only. In it, preschoolers are mailed one book a month until they begin first grade. Parton&#39;s library program now includes 183 communities in 25 states. <br><br>With the aid of the U.S. Department of the Interior&#39;s Bureau of Indian Affairs, 92 Indian communities are being adopted and will start getting books early next year. <br><br>The idea is to stimulate children&#39;s interest in reading at an early age. In theory, when a child begins school, they&#39;ll have a ready-made passion for learning because of early reading experiences. <br><br>The proficiency rate among American Indian students in math, English and science is well below the national average, federal officials said. The national dropout rate for Indians in the United States is close to 18 percent. <br><br>&quot;Many of these families on reservations come from (less) than modest economic circumstances,&quot; said Neal McCaleb, assistant secretary for Indian affairs in the U.S. Department of the Interior. &quot;So many of these homes on the reservations are bookless. This now will provide the basic foundation for reading skills and instructions.&quot; <br><br>The expansion &quot;is a big commitment on the part of the Imagination Library,&quot; he said.<br> The federal government will provide names and addresses for the Indian preschoolers who want to get books, McCaleb said. The government will also pay for the books and the mailing costs. Parton&#39;s foundation will screen and distribute the books. <br><br>Any child, regardless of economic background, can be part of the library&#39;s books program. Costs are handled through support of community groups such as the United Way. <br><br>Parton, who said her ancestry includes Cherokee, performed benefit concerts Friday and Saturday at her Dollywood theme park to raise money for her foundation. <br><br>The foundation, aside from its Imagination Library, also provides scholarships and school materials, primarily in Sevier County. <br><br>The singing star laughs now at how her background might &quot;ruin&quot; her foundation&#39;s good work. <br><br>&quot;I hated school. I was not a good student, and I wanted to drop out,&quot; she said. <br><br>She says she often thinks of why she stayed with school. <br><br>&quot;First of all, I knew I couldn&#39;t leave home until I was 18,&quot; she said. &quot;There were so many kids at home I knew I&#39;d have to work my (behind) off if I stayed there. So I (thought I should) just as soon be in school, and maybe I could learn something.&quot; <br><br>She says she wasn&#39;t a stellar student. She was held back in the third grade, but she enjoyed the interaction with other kids her age. <br><br>Parton said staying in school helped motivate her to read, too. Now, at 57, she&#39;s a voracious reader.  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Mountain Press</font><br><font size="2">December 14, 2002</font><br><br><b>Imagination Library gains new partners</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mountain Press" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton is in town this weekend for her annual Christmas concerts and to announce a new partnership between her Imagination Library and the various Native American communities in the country. <br><br>Parton, who claims to have Cherokee blood running through her, greeted representatives from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Cherokee Nation, the National Center for Family Literacy and the Parents as Teachers. <br><br>&quot;Which part of me do you think looks Cherokee?&quot; Parton asked Friday as she introduced Chad Smith, chief of the Cherokee Nation. <br><br>His answer: her voice. <br><br>A sample of the Cherokee voice was demonstrated during the event by the Cherokee Nation Youth Choir. The group of children sang in the Cherokee language before Parton took the stage. <br><br>The choir was started to &quot;keep our language alive,&quot; Smith said. <br><br>Parton&#39;s Imagination Library provides books for young children in communities across the nation. Every month of the child&#39;s first five years a book arrives in the mail. The program provides books for every child in selected communities through partnerships with local businesses and organizations. There were 121 communities in 25 states before the new partnership was formed. <br><br>The Bureau of Indian Affairs has partnered with Parents as Teachers and the National Center for Family Literacy to pay $27 per child, so American Indian children can get books. <br><br>Parton&#39;s program will now reach 60 additional Native American communities that have been added. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s about dreams and opportunities for Indian children,&quot; said Neal McCaleb, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs of the Department of Interior. &quot;You can&#39;t read if you don&#39;t have books.&quot; <br><br>In 2003 the Imagination Library intends to introduce several books into the program that address Native American culture and themes. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;re hoping next year to give out a million books,&quot; Parton said. <br><br>During the event Parton signed a pair of books for two Native American children, and presented Dr. Renee O&#39;Leary of Newark, Del., with the second annual &quot;Chasing Rainbows Award&quot; for her work as a teacher. <br><br>Parton also received gifts from representatives of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes. From the Cherokee she was given a quilt, and the Choctaw gift was a hand-woven basket. <br><br>Parton performed Friday night and has shows scheduled for today in Dollywood. The performances are sold out. <br><br>&quot;Three years of Christmas concerts,&quot; Parton said. &quot;It&#39;s become a tradition.&quot; <br><br>Parton grew up in Sevier County before becoming a country music superstar, but many young children knew her simply as the &quot;book lady,&quot; she said, and they believe that she personally delivers their books every month. Parton said she would do it if she could because the program is that important to her. <br><br>&quot;We can&#39;t do enough for the little kids, can we?&quot; she asked. &quot;I&#39;m just proud to do whatever I can.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Knoxville News-Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">December 17, 2002</font><br><br><b>TV movie, music in Parton&#39;s future plans</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton has television plans in her immediate future. <br><br>She is preparing to play the lead in the Mae West story, a two-hour made-for-TV movie to air on ABC.

Roach&rsquo;s credits include the &quot;Three Stooges&quot; bio-pic that aired in 2000 on ABC. <br><br>Even with other writers on the project, Parton is confident that some of Roach&rsquo;s work will be retained and make for a good script. <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s not up to me,&quot; Parton says of when the project will get going. &quot;(The network) has certain things they want done with it, so that&rsquo;s why they keep bringing in different writers. <br><br>&quot;It won&rsquo;t do it until there is a final script, then that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll begin.&quot; <br><br>Such delays can be frustrating, but Parton says she&rsquo;s not fretting. <br><br>&quot;I&rsquo;m getting mellow about how picky I am,&quot; she says jokingly. <br><br>What&rsquo;s she pickiest about? <br><br>&quot;My time and how I spend it,&quot; she says more seriously. &quot;I do what feels right to be that day, whether it pleases anyone else or not. If I feel good about it, then that&rsquo;s what I am supposed to do.&quot; <br><br>She has other plans of a musical nature. She wants to do a &quot;great country album,&quot; a gospel recording, a collection of children&rsquo;s tunes and even a dance remix disc. <br><br>&quot;I have a lot of different fans, and I want to please them all,&quot; she says. <br><br>Bluegrass music, which she has been doing to critical acclaim in recent years, isn&rsquo;t on her agenda. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want to get pigeonholed in this bluegrass thing,&quot; she says.  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Goldmine</font><br><font size="2">December 27, 2002</font><br><br><b>Down home with Dolly Parton</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Goldmine" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Goldmine" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton is one of the most recognizable entertainers in the world, especially in country music. While her larger-than-life image and down-home persona are immediately identifiable, Parton&#39;s real genius lies in her considerable artistic strengths as a vocalist and songwriter.<br><br>Over the last four years, she has released two bluegrass albums with some of the best musicians in the business, way before traditional music was resurrected by the <i>O Brother Where Art Thou?</i> soundtrack. On those two critically acclaimed Sugar Hill albums, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and <i>Little Sparrow</i>, Parton has created two durable collections of beautifully articulated roots music that showcase her amble artistic strengths. <br><br>Our interview was held in a small house at Parton&#39;s private office complex in midtown Nashville. Once given the OK from her assistant Theresa, I was led through a lush courtyard to a welcoming Parton standing at the screen door waving me in as if we were old friends. Her hospitality was overwhelming, and she seemed to bounce around from room to room as she took me on a tour. The Southwestern-styled dwelling is more of a house than an office, with a mirrored dressing and makeup room adjacent to a homey living area and a kitchen. <br><br>At the time of the interview, her new album on Sugar Hill, <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, had just been completed, and she was beaming with excitement. Once settled in, Dolly played me an unmastered work CD on a small boombox as she sat cross-legged on the floor. At times, while guiding me through the album, her enthusiasm would overtake her and she would belt out a line or even sing along to a chorus. The new record features her new band, The Blue-Niques, and a slew of original compositions, as well as two classic covers: Bread&#39;s &quot;If&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#39;s &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot; <br><br>Whether they are conscious of it or not, artists who endure always offer a tangible personality that people can relate to. Parton&#39;s ability to translate her experiences growing up in the East Tennessee mountains have connected with millions of devoted listeners over the years. As readers will see in the following interview, Parton is a fearless person who abides by the belief that one should be connected to emotional and spiritual truth-telling instinct. She wants her fans to laugh and cry with her. She&#39;s also a woman who demands passion and intelligently guides her own career the only way she sees fit, her own way. <br><br>As a result, Parton has spent years contributing enormous amounts of time and capital investing in the well-being and development of those in need around her. In a music business that&#39;s become more image and presentation over art and heart, an individual voice like Parton&#39;s is priceless.<br><br><i>Goldmine: First off, thanks for having us over to do this interview. This is nice little set-up with your office and this house.</i><br>I fixed this little house up when I bought the place next door. It&#39;s worked out just great, so we could bring people like you over here to do interviews. Do you want some breakfast?  <i>No, thank you.</i> <br> I can make you some toast and eggs, if you need it.  <i>No, I appreciate it. I&#39;m fine thank you.</i> <br> Did you get a chance to hear an advance of the album yet?  <i>No. Not yet.</i> <br> Oh, you haven&#39;t? Well, that&#39;s a shame. I got just my work tape, but I&#39;ll be happy to play it for you.  [We take time out to listen to <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i>, being played out of a boombox.] <br><br><i>How did the new album,</i> Halos &amp; Horns<i>, evolve?</i><br>I went to East Tennessee to try and find as many musicians back home as I could. I had written a bunch of this stuff at my Tennessee Mountain Home, which is my old place that I bought years ago and fixed up like a retreat. I go there and write all the time. Gary Davis, who helped me pull all of this together, put the band together too.<br>All the people on this album are part of my new band, they&#39;re called The Blue-Niques. Unique bluegrass is why I picked the name.<br>Originally I thought, &quot;What a great way for me to audition these musicians.&quot; I was really just trying to find a band. I thought, &quot;I&#39;m just going to go in and demo these songs through my publishing company and just pay for this and find a good studio up home.&quot; Well, we got in there and they just all sounded great from the start. It was a great studio, Southern Sounds Studio in Knoxville. Danny Brown, he&#39;s the engineer and he&#39;s one of the owners of the studio, did a whole bunch of song, 25 over the course of several weeks.<br>While we were doing this, I told Steve Buckingham, who&#39;s my friend and my producer and coproducer for 12 or 13 years now, &quot;This stuff is turning out really good. It sounds like it could be a record.&quot; He said, &quot;Well just go on with it. Just let what happens happen.&quot; So I did.<br>Steve was real proud of this and supportive. I didn&#39;t want anybody thinking that me and Steve had any problems because he&#39;s been really behind me all the way with this. He said, &quot;This is great as an artist, for you writing all these songs and for people to know that you can do it all. Because you do anyway.&quot; I missed working with him on it, but I was so excited about my new band. <br><br><i>&quot;Halos &amp; Horns&quot; is the album&#39;s title track and also the album&#39;s opener. It really seems to set an uplifting, spiritual tone that resonates throughout the record.</i><br>That song is just about how we try to do good and we fall down and make our mistakes and ask God to forgive us and take off our horns and put on our halos again for a while. Then we slip and we slide just the same old thing like we always do. I really like it.<br>I tried to expand on this album like we have the last two because I don&#39;t ever want to get pigeonholed, or &quot;Pidgeon Forged&quot; I should say, into people thinking I&#39;m just going to do one thing. I thought the whole title of <i>Halos &amp; Horns</i> fit what I was doing because of the last two albums. The first one [<i>The Grass Is Blue</i>] was bluegrass. The second one [<i>Little Sparrow</i>] added a little more mountain music and a little bit of Irish flavor. In this one, I wanted to add a little more gospel along with some harder country-type things like the old days of country. But it&#39;s just solid, more bluegrass country. And, yes, I wrote all the songs on this except &quot;If,&quot; the David Gates song, and &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; which I did in a very unusual way. <br><br><i>When I first heard that you were doing &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; I thought, &quot;That&#39;s a bold choice.&quot; But from just hearing your version just now, it is very clear that you made it your own song.</i><br>Well, they&#39;ll either love my version of &quot;Stairway&quot; or they&#39;ll hate me for it. I just love the song. I just interpreted it my way. I was trying to make my part come out of my soul too, you know, to Dolly-ize it. I always thought it sounded like a spiritual song, and that&#39;s why I wanted to put the choir on it and do it a little different. In fact, [Led Zeppelin&#39;s] Robert Plant said that he had always thought of this as a spiritual song, and he was thrilled that I had put the choir on it &#39;cause he had always heard it like that. Everybody said, &quot;You can&#39;t do that. That&#39;s a classic.&quot; I said, &quot;I know it&#39;s a classic, but nobody&#39;s ever done it. Everybody&#39;s afraid to do it, and these people wrote this great song.&quot; But, I really felt it. I really got into the spirit of the song. But, it just goes to show you, a good song can be done any way if you really mean it. <br><br><i>I&#39;ve always loved the group Bread, and &quot;If&quot; is a great song. There&#39;s a certain element of sweetness in that song that seems to be missing in a lot of current popular music.</i><br>I agree. I thought they were so great. I was just thrilled to get to do this. I did &quot;If&quot; uptempo, sort of like how Ray Stevens did with &quot;Misty.&quot; It also kind of reminds me of the [Harry] Nilsson song &quot;Everybody&#39;s Talkin&#39;.&quot; It&#39;s kind of got that rolling feel. When you get a song like &quot;If&quot; that has touched the lives of so many people, you have to handle it with delicate care. You just don&#39;t go and put anything on it. You think, &quot;What can I do with this great song that will not be a gimmick but make it my own and still make it something a little bit different?&quot;<br>But anyhow, there are a lot of songs on the album. There are some gospel things, one is talking about swimming naked in a pond and the next one is like, &quot;Hello, God, are you out there?&quot; [laughs] It&#39;s really just life stories. It goes from heartache to heaven, spirituality to sexuality. [laughs] <br><br><i>It&#39;s all part of creation.</i><br>Yeah, it&#39;s true. That&#39;s how I look at life. See, I take this stuff so seriously. These things are sacred to me. When I decided I was going to do &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; I truly felt like I was walking on sacred ground. But you still have to take a chance. If you don&#39;t take some chances, what are you going to do that&#39;s quality? <br><br><i>One thing that has always marked my perception of your career and your persona has been this certain devotion to fearlessness.</i><br>Well, I&#39;m not afraid to do things. Of course, we&#39;re all full of different kinds of fear for different kinds of reasons, but I have never been afraid of myself. My desire to do things was always greater than my fear of it. I&#39;m a singer. I&#39;m a writer. I&#39;m a person that&#39;s just out in this world to have as much fun as I can and put as much into the world as I can, and get as much out of it. If I make five mistakes and do one great thing, well I&#39;m not going to worry about the five mistakes I made. I&#39;m going to waller in the glory of the one great thing I did in hopes that it brought some joy to somebody else. <br><br><i>You didn&#39;t tour behind your previous two albums.</i><br>No. We couldn&#39;t. Jerry Douglas and all them, The Blue Boys I call them, they are all such big stars that we never could pull it together where we could tour. They were all committed to do stuff. Jerry&#39;s with Alison [Krauss], and most of them have their own groups. But me and The Blue-Niques are going to be doing some concerts. We are going to go out there and promote this and see how it feels out there. If it feels good, I&#39;m going to do some touring. Not a lot, not like I used to. I&#39;m 56 years old, and I&#39;ve been doing this since I was a kid. I&#39;m like, up there. <br><br><i>You would never know by the way you plunked yourself down on the floor when we were listening to the album. I don&#39;t think I could sit down like that, and I&#39;m in my mid-20s.</i><br>Well that&#39;s because you got legs. I got no legs. [laughs] <br><br><i>It was almost like a lotus position. I was going, &quot;I bet she&#39;s done some kind of yoga.&quot;</i><br>No. If there&#39;s any yoga being done around here, it&#39;s in my head. I&#39;m a very flexible person. I&#39;m small, and I&#39;m very energetic. My husband just gets floored sometimes. I&#39;ll be painting my toenails and I&#39;ll be standing in the kitchen and I&#39;ll have my leg completely up on the sink and he&#39;ll say, &quot;I can&#39;t f-ing believe that you&#39;re standing there with your leg hiked up like that. That would break my back!&quot; And I say, &quot;Well I ain&#39;t big enough, it ain&#39;t that far.&quot; But I&#39;m just a little person. I&#39;m not very physical. I&#39;m basically lazy when it comes to that. But my mind is always so open. I never age because I never have time. I don&#39;t think about the fact that I&#39;m supposed to be getting older. It&#39;s like, &quot;I don&#39;t see why, your Honor.&quot; So I guess if my mind ain&#39;t old, my body ain&#39;t either. <br><br>T<i>hat&#39;s a good way of looking at it.</i><br>Well, the good thing is, if I live a long time and I think I might, I&#39;ll always sing. My voice ain&#39;t going at all. I can sing as good as I did &mdash; If I ever could. I would imagine that, people like me, what they call semi-legends or legends, will be singing from now on like Mother Maybelle. So I&#39;ll be doing records from now on, and I&#39;m going to do a lot of surprises through the years. I&#39;ve got some big thoughts in mind. I&#39;m just trying to get my foot planted solid onto something to know that people will accept it.<br>Nobody plays artists like me on country radio anymore, because they assume that people my age are over. But artists like me hopefully never are. Because I&#39;ve lived so many lifetimes and I grew up and spent most of my young life with no electricity or nothing. To come from that, back there in the mountains to this high-tech world where now I&#39;m doing CDs and stuff I don&#39;t even understand. By the time I was 10 years old, I was on the radio and television, and we didn&#39;t have either one. We didn&#39;t even have electricity. But I&#39;ve lived that life, and its just in my psyche. That&#39;s just my Smokey Mountain DNA, and these kind of songs and these kind of feelings and this kind of hurt...my own hurt as well as the hurts that you take on of your family and the people that you know and love...is real to me. And when I open my mouth, you know it&#39;s real if I&#39;m singing about that kind of stuff. Once I start to sing, it just gets in me. That kind of music just hollers at me all the time and says, &quot;You get back in here. This is what you do. This is what you do best.&quot;<br>I want everything to be real from now on. I&#39;m not trying to be commercial. I want everything to have heart and soul. I have had to be commercial through the years, and I don&#39;t regret anything I&#39;ve ever done because it&#39;s took all of that to make me who I am.<br>You know, music is the voice of the soul, but there&#39;s just a thing that comes out of certain voices and certain people. You don&#39;t know what it is you&#39;re feeling, but it stirs you. People have not been stirred emotionally in so long. We just get too comfortable, and a thing like Sept. 11 happens and jolts you back into reality. That whole event really just shook everybody&#39;s confidence. You just saw how little life is and how fragile and small and fearful we all are. You just realize that there must be something greater than you, otherwise you&#39;d totally fall apart.<br>Think about all those people in other countries. There are whole cities that are torn down, and hundreds of thousands of people die all the time. It makes you really think about your own life and the things you take for granted and what you could do to make your own life as well as the lives of other people around you a little better. <br><br><i>I would imagine that &quot;Hello God,&quot; which is off your new album, is meant to be a rather poignant reflection of the current times.</i><br>Yes, it is, as a matter of fact. I wrote several songs after Sept. 11, like we all did. Everybody just lives their own life and then, when you get in trouble, you think, &quot;Oh, God, help me now.&quot; This idea just came to me and it just started rolling out and I just wrote that song in no time. But it was very inspired. I have very strong feelings about that song.<br>I do have a lot of faith in God, as I perceive him. Everybody thinks of God as a different thing. To me, God is that greater, higher energy, that greater, wiser wisdom. It&#39;s that thing in all of us that we have to draw from. I&#39;ve always trusted God and trusted myself. It&#39;s like, if I got those two things, faith in God and faith in myself, which to me are intertwined, I&#39;m fine.<br>I just always kind of drug from that God thing. My grandpa was a preacher, and I believed that through God I could do everything. That&#39;s still where I get my strength, and that&#39;s why so many of my songs have an inspirational feeling. It&#39;s not just me giving it back to God, it&#39;s me trying to give it to other people. To give from God, through me, to somebody else that might not have that kind of confidence. So, it works, and it&#39;s fun for me. It enriches my life. Hopefully, I can enlighten and enrich somebody else in whatever way I might. If nothing else, just for somebody to say, &quot;Well, she had the balls to do that? Well, I got the balls to listen!&quot; And at least not crucify me. And so what? What are they going to do, kick my ass?<br><i>Well you&#39;ve managed, somehow or another, to protect yourself enough to be able to stay in touch with what you really feel.</i><br>Yeah, that&#39;s because money don&#39;t mean anything to me. I love having money and what money can do, but money has never been the thing that motivated me. It was always the art. I always figured, if I did well with my music, that the money would always come. It always has. The fact that I never wanted money meant that it was always there. I just always assumed I&#39;d have money. When I was poor, I figured I couldn&#39;t get no poorer.<br>If somebody said, &quot;You&#39;re going to have to do one or the other. You&#39;re going to have to give up your music or you&#39;re going to go back to being poor,&quot; I would go poor, totally broke, and start over again and do my music. That&#39;s how much I love it. They say a rich man can&#39;t sing the blues, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think if you stay true to your roots and home is always in your heart and in your head, you&#39;ll succeed. Don&#39;t dwell on just the material things. I know this sounds like a joke because I look like the phoniest person in the world when you look at me. But a lot of my look came out of a little country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour should be. Then it got to be comfortable, and I liked it, just like how people like to dress up. I always wanted to be pretty and look good, but just poor ragged-ass-looking kids, you look the way you look. You do with what you have and you always think, &quot;Well, when I get money I&#39;ll have this and I&#39;ll have that.&quot; And it didn&#39;t buy me any class. [laughs]<br>But I like looking the way I look, and I&#39;m comfortable with who I am. I like looking like trash, but I know in my heart that I&#39;m not. I am so much inside to just have a plain surface. I feel so many things and my heart and soul is so real. Just to be a plain old person on the outside just don&#39;t get it for me. Like Minnie Pearl used to say, &quot;Any old barn looks better with a little red paint on it.&quot; That&#39;s sort of how I feel. People always say, &quot;Less is more,&quot; but I say, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s bullshit! More is more, and I can&#39;t get enough of more.&quot; Everybody&#39;s different, and I understand what they&#39;re saying, but I just love stuff. I love playing in paints and crayons and I love the way things feel on my body. I dress up even when I&#39;m by myself. I can&#39;t stand to walk around slouchy all day. Everybody&#39;s comfort is their own, and that all depends. But to me I&#39;m more comfortable when I got on makeup and look the way I want to look. I&#39;ve always said that if I hadn&#39;t have been a woman then I damn sure would&#39;ve been a drag queen. That may be a funny thing to say, but I mean that in all sincerity. Yeah. I love it. <br><br><i>It is amazing how hard it is for many of us to express our uniqueness.</i><br>It&#39;s awful how some people have crippled so many wonderful people who would have been so many things, but they had to spend all their time worrying about how to get by because of somebody else&#39;s perception of them. I just think that&#39;s terrible. Those crippling people are truly unhappy, because they live in a real shaded world. People that aren&#39;t willing to open their heart or minds to anything other than what they understand and know...I think those people are missing out on everything, really. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a great thing to be able to write songs too. I like to write for everybody else, and I write a lot of songs about being somebody or being yourself. Be who you are, have confidence. It&#39;s about your attitude. I write a lot of stuff like that. I&#39;ve often said, &quot;People don&#39;t come to see me be me, they come to see me be them.&quot; I have written something that they relate to. I&#39;m going to sing something and make them feel something. I&#39;m up there doing something that they might have wanted to do, and whether they wanted to do that or not, they can sense that freedom. People appreciate it. Especially those closed people that don&#39;t get to have that self-expression from either a husband, a parent or a wife. <br><br><i>Or themselves.</i><br>Or themselves. You&#39;re right. But they love it when somebody can just not have fear about who they are. Sometimes things pop out of my mouth that almost scare me, and I think, &quot;Oh my, you ought to keep your big mouth shut!&quot; I&#39;m like an innocent child in that respect. I think, &quot;Why <i>can&#39;t</i> I say what&#39;s on my mind? Why can&#39;t I say that, if that&#39;s what I think?&quot; Of course, they say it&#39;s better to choose what you say than to say what you choose. But, I still think that there&#39;s a certain honesty in saying what you choose. <br><br>T<i>he movie</i> Nine To Five <i>is a good example of standing up and saying what you choose.</i><br>That little movie has become like a classic, but at that time, that&#39;s when women were speaking out for their rights. But I just did it because Jane Fonda called me and told me what it was about and asked me if I was interested in doing it. I thought, &quot;Well I&#39;m going to be in a movie with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. If it&#39;s a hit, I can take credit, and if it&#39;s a flop then it&#39;s their fault. [laughs] It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to go punish me. They don&#39;t even know who I am.&quot; I thought it was a good subject matter. I wouldn&#39;t have done it had I not believed in what I was doing. I&#39;d been asked to do stuff before, but that was the first movie I did. Now Jane had heard that I was a pretty big country artist at the time and people seemed to like me, and she heard different people talking about me. Her statement to somebody was, &quot;Dolly will get us the South.&quot; I thought, &quot;Well, Dolly might just get you some North and East too!&quot; [laughs] I was like, &quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot; Really, I knew what she meant. She meant the <i>country</i> people, country music, the &quot;South&quot;, I guess. But boy, I never let her forget that. I said, &quot;Little did you know that I was going to get some of the others too.&quot; Of course that was her business way of thinking and that&#39;s what she meant, and that was fine. She was right. She was right in picking a country person. <br><br><i>It&#39;s like picking a candidate.</i><br>Exactly. Get her, she&#39;s got a good personality and she&#39;s got big tits and big hair and people like her, she&#39;s a &quot;character.&quot; I just always thought if something comes to me that feels right, I&#39;ll do it. The worst that can happen is it won&#39;t be successful. I&#39;ve tried lots of things that didn&#39;t work out. But If I felt really strong about something, I&#39;ll take the idea and put it on the back burner. That way I can pull from it later on. A good idea is like a good song, It&#39;s always good. It&#39;s just the timing may not be right. Either the people that you&#39;re with at the time may not see what you see or there are too many egos involved. Some of my best stuff is things I&#39;ve done years and years ago. A good example is &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; Look at what that song has done, and I wrote that song in &#39;71 or &#39;72. <br><br><i>What inspired that?</i><br>I wrote that song about my relationship with Porter Wagoner, the guy I used to sing with. We had been together for seven years, and we were really big as a duet. When I started with Porter I said that I would stay five years, because I wasn&#39;t looking to be part of anyone else&#39;s show. I wanted to have my own band and I wanted to be my own show. But he didn&#39;t want me to go. Porter was very stubborn and very set in his ways, and rightfully so, it was his show. We fought all the time anyway, especially about my songs, because I&#39;d write them and he&#39;d produce them. I had to try so hard to get my ideas in there. It was kind of like one of those love/hate relationships. I was afraid of Porter. He was very powerful, and he used that too. He scared the shit out of me all the time. <br><br><i>It&#39;s codependent after a while.</i> <br><br>Yeah, I couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. Both my personal life and my emotional and creative self, I just wasn&#39;t being everything I knew I should be. But anyway, Porter would just not listen to me. I said, &quot;Let me get some other producers and some outside management and I&#39;ll work within the show.&quot; That wouldn&#39;t do it. He wasn&#39;t going to allow nobody to do nothing but him. After so much time, I was like, &quot;I got to go.&quot; He was terrible upset about it, so he sued me for a million dollars and took every dime I had. Luckily, my husband was smart with money, so we had saved up enough to get by. Later he said he was sorry about it, and that&#39;s OK. It was worth it to me if that&#39;s what I had to do. But anyhow, I was really heartbroken and sick of just trying to figure out how to make the move easy because I wasn&#39;t out to hurt anybody. It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t appreciate him, it&#39;s just that I had to go on. He was never going to listen to a word I have to say. He wouldn&#39;t even talk without screaming at me or jumping down my throat every time I open my mouth. So, one night, I wrote this song: &quot;If I should stay, truly I&#39;d just be in your way&quot;...and he definitely was in mine at that time. &quot;So I&#39;ll go but I know I&#39;ll think of you each step of the way/and I&#39;ll always appreciate you/and I&#39;ll always love you/and I hope life treats you kind. I hope you have all you ever dreamed of/Bittersweet memories, that&#39;s all I&#39;m taking with me/Goodbye, don&#39;t cry because we both know I&#39;m not what you need.&quot;<br>It was one of those relationships that had just got so twisted around your heart and soul and your creativity and work. It was a big mess to where you couldn&#39;t move one way without it affecting something else. It was hard. So that song came from a very very real and sincere place of trying to be kind. I just took it in to him one day and said, &quot;If you ain&#39;t going to listen to me talk, will you listen to this song?&quot; And I sang him the song. And he loved the song, of course he wanted to produce it. So I let him. But it was still my leaving song. That song is like 30-something years ago. I had a hit on it in &#39;72, I think. Every 10 years since I wrote it, it&#39;s been #1. I&#39;m the first artist that&#39;s ever had a #1 song on the same song twice. I had one in &#39;72 with it when it first came out and in &#39;82 when I did <i>The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas.</i><br><i>Was it re-recorded for that?</i><br>Yeah, I re-recorded it and it became #1 again. Then me and Vince [Gill] had a Top 10 record. And then Whitney [Houston]. Now I&#39;ve got to do it bluegrass. We do a bluegrass, up-tempo version of it as a playoff at the end of my show. It works really good. <br><br><i>Dollywood is one of the most successful theme parks in the country. What inspired that project?</i><br>It came from me just wanting to do something to make my people proud of me. I just thought it would be great to have something to leave for my family. You know, you always want your people to be proud of you. I need to have something up home. People don&#39;t know it, but the Smokey Mountains is the most visited national park in the United States. We get 10 million people through there a year. We got almost three million people through Dollywood last year, and we&#39;re only open six full months. But it&#39;s really provided a lot of jobs for the area. It&#39;s not only helped me, but it&#39;s also helped a lot of people. <br><br><i>Dollywood has also done a considerable amount of charity work, too.</i> <br><br>Yeah. We have a huge thing that the United Way is in on now. It&#39;s all over the country, we&#39;re actually going to be worldwide later, but it&#39;s the Imagination library. For years now, we&#39;ve given scholarships to people and helped kids with their medical needs and their school needs and still do. We even have a hotline for kids. We also decided we should help the little kids when they are most susceptible. So every kid in Sevier County [Tenn.] gets a book a month from the day it&#39;s born until the day it starts kindergarten. We give out thousands and thousands of books all over the country now. They call me The Book Lady. It&#39;s important to me because my dad couldn&#39;t read or write, and many of my relatives didn&#39;t get an education. So not only is Dollywood a theme park, but it also does a lot of good things and a lot of stuff comes out of that. <br><br>These days, I&#39;m having to speak to all these educators and all these teachers, and I hated school. I&#39;ve done more homework in the last five years than I did in 12 years, just working on these projects. But anyways, somebody said, &quot;Well, now that you&#39;re The Book Lady and you&#39;re involved with these kids and this education, are you going to tone down your look?&quot; And I said, &quot;Why should I? It was all of that that made all of this that put me in this position. Don&#39;t you get it?&quot; I might look like a phony to you now, but if I start changing things, then I would <i>really</i> be a phony. This is who I am. I see no reason to think that I have to look like a school teacher. I&#39;d rather look like a whore. I&#39;m getting the same job done. It doesn&#39;t matter. But people are funny about changing. Like I say, no matter how phony I look or how much shit I&#39;ve done that people would criticize, I know that when I get into that God place and I start to sing a certain kind of song, whether it&#39;s a gospel or a mountain song, there are just certain things that I mean to tell you...it just does everything inside of me. That&#39;s why it comes out like that. I ain&#39;t making no money doing this kind of stuff. Bluegrass and mountain music ain&#39;t never made no money. It&#39;s like I said before, I had to get rich in able to sing like I was poor again. I just open my mouth and thank God I can deliver. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">US Weekly</font><br><font size="2">February 12, 2001</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Here She Comes Again</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>New record, new Grammy nominations, same old Dolly Parton.

Always has. A true country girl, at 55 she has been married to the same man, asphalt paving-firm owner Carl Dean, for almost 35 years. Parton spends most of her time at home in her native Tennessee, surrounded by who knows how many family members, she&#39;s the fourth of the twelve children raised by her late father, farmer Robert Lee Parton, and her homemaker mother, Avie Lee Parton. But Dolly Parton is not turning into some shy little homebody. Consider her appearance at a press conference last June to announce plans to build a $20 million water park next to her 15-year-old Dollywood theme park: The famously buxom blonde showed up in a black-and-gold wet suit. <br><br>&quot;I think people see themselves in me,&quot; she says with a smile. &quot;I often say &#39;People don&#39;t come to see me be <i>me</i>, they come to see me be <i>them</i>. &#39;It&#39;s like they can relate to my stories, the stuff that I say and the jokes that I tell.&quot; <br><br>They&#39;ve been coming for 44 years. She has released 72 albums since she began her stage career as an 11-year-old singing guitarist at the Grand Ole Opry. This year, Parton, who became a household name way beyond the <i>Hee Haw</i> world of haystacks and horses with her crossover hit &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; 24 years ago, is up for two Grammys for work on her debut bluegrass album, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>. Her second bluegrass collection, <i>Little Sparrow</i>, was released on January 23. Even her bluegrass comes with a twist, in between traditional tunes, she squeezes in delicious renditions of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;Travelin&#39; Prayer,&quot; Cole Porter&#39;s &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot; and Collective Soul&#39;s &quot;Shine.&quot; <br><br>If she gets her way, she may even give a jolt of country twang to Led Zeppelin. &quot;I think they&#39;re the greatest group that ever was,&quot; Parton says, curled up on a flower-print couch in a suite at New York&#39;s Pierre Hotel. &quot;I want Jimmy Page to come into the studio for my next album. If I love a song and it just burns in me, well, I&#39;ll find a way to do it. At my age, it&#39;s like I&#39;m not doing it for any reason other than I just feel like it. People ain&#39;t buying my damn records anyway, so why can&#39;t I at least take a chance if I&#39;m paying for the studio session?&quot;<br><br><b>How do you think your looks have affected your career?</b> <br>That&#39;s a tricky question, &#39;cause it has worked against me in many ways as well as it&#39;s worked for me. Like this bluegrass music &mdash; it&#39;s very serious and real music. But it doesn&#39;t fit with my look, meaning that most people don&#39;t take my music as seriously as they would. But I love the gaudiness and the glamour, and I like dressing up. I&#39;ve said it&#39;s a good thing I was born a girl, because if I&#39;d have been a boy, I&#39;d have been a drag queen. I definitely would have been. &#39;Cause, see, I have to shine. I have to. <br><br><b>Drag queens love dressing up like you.</b> <br>I know. I was doing a photo shoot earlier today, and I had on this short skirt and I had my legs up, and this woman said, &quot;You have drag-queen legs.&quot; I said, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; She said, &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed how drag queens have the most beautiful legs?&quot; Well, that&#39;s one of the greatest compliments anybody&#39;s ever paid me. I just have to be myself and if you like it, you like it. If you don&#39;t, you don&#39;t. I&#39;ve had so many people that are, like, true purists who say &quot;You know, Dolly, you could have done so much more with your music if you had not been so outrageous.&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, but what kind of fun would I have had? What kind of a drag-ass, dull life would that be?&quot; <br><br><b>Are you surprised by how many different kinds of fans you have &mdash; from those drag queens to sweet elderly ladies in Tennessee and everyone in between?</b> <br>No. When I sing &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; the little old ladies back home know that I appreciate my parents and know that I&#39;ve had a hard life. And I think some of the people look at the way I dress and think, <i>Oh, poor little thing, she don&#39;t even know how she looks. Bless her heart. Isn&#39;t she pitiful?</i> [<i>Laughs</i>.] But others think, <i>Its pretty bold of her. I think she knows exactly what she&#39;s doing.</i> All of that stuff is true. I am poor, pitiful me. It all came from a country girl&#39;s idea of what glamour was. <br><br><b>What kind of music do you listen to in your free time?</b> <br>I don&#39;t listen to a lot, &#39;cause I&#39;m always working on something else of my own. I don&#39;t have music blasting all the time, &#39;cause I have to think. I like to think and write. But I am one of those radio punchers when I&#39;m in the car. If I don&#39;t like what&#39;s on the country station, I&#39;ll punch it to a rock station or to whatever. I just listen to whatever catches my attention.<br> <b>Ever listen to Eminem?</b> <br>I do. I want to listen to see what it is and what the appeal is. But I can&#39;t get into some of it. I think, <i>God, I am old</i>. My little nieces and nephews are just so into it, though. But you know, we always think every generation has gone to the dogs. But I listen to everything, &#39;cause I need to know. If nothing else, it shows me how to communicate with my nieces and nephews. But thank God I&#39;m not a parent, because it would scare me to death, some of this stuff. I wouldn&#39;t know what to do, really I wouldn&#39;t.<br> <b>Do you remember the first time you heard yourself on the radio?</b> <br>Yes. I was 10 years old. I had a little song out on Gold Band Records called &quot;Puppy Love.&quot; Of course it was a big hit in my hometown, but it didn&#39;t go anywhere else. I was at my aunt&#39;s house and sitting up on the kitchen counter. She had the radio across the room, and she had a throw rug in her kitchen that had a hardwood floor. And she had the radio on the local station, and all of a sudden my record came on, &#39;cause my uncle had taken it down there. I got so excited that I jumped off the counter, started running and slid on the rug, sailed down, knocked over all kinds of stuff. But I didn&#39;t slow down. I didn&#39;t care if I&#39;d have broke my arms and legs. I just had to get across the floor to turn that radio up. My whole world changed. <br><br><b>How many instruments do you play?</b> <br>I play banjo, the dulcimer, autoharp and guitar. I don&#39;t play anything great on the piano, but I play it all enough to where I can get some good sounds and get some good things going. I used to play guitar really well before I got these nails, but I&#39;m such a girlie girl. <br><br><b>Those nails get in the way, huh?</b> <br>Well, I play, but I&#39;m limited. But when I write seriously or really want to put down some guitar, I just have to take these acrylic nails off and build a new set when I&#39;m done. But I can&#39;t stand not to have my nails. I have to be a girl. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Next Magazine</font><br><font size="2">February 16, 2001</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Dolly Goes Back To Her Roots</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Ross Bleckner Interviews Dolly Parton</b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Next Magazine" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Next Magazine" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton has the bead on rags-to-riches. She was born in 1946 on a farm in Locust Ridge, part of eastern Tennessee&#39;s Smoky Mountains. Dolly&#39;s parents often used cornmeal to pay the doctor who delivered their 12 children. Since then, Dolly has become one of entertainment&#39;s biggest crossover country successes. Anyone with a radio knows &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; and &quot;Here You Come Again.&quot; Her film work gave us characters as indelible as Truvy and Dora Lee. She&#39;s even given us the 1979&#39;s disco classic &quot;Baby I&#39;m Burning,&quot; helped hustle the word &quot;whorehouse&quot; into the popular lexicon and moved us on the dance floor with her re-mixes of &quot;Peace Train.&quot; With all that Dolly&#39;s done for us, we thought it would be nice to get her together with her old friend Ross Bleckner for a chat. They sat down when Dolly was in New York to promote her new album <i>Little Sparrow</i>. By the time they were through, Dolly dropped a Carnegie Hall announcement and Ross was booking spring travel to Dollywood. <b><br><br>DOLLY</b>: Hi, Ross! <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Dolly, hi, how are you? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I couldn&#39;t believe it when they said <i>you</i> was going to be doing an interview. I said, &quot;Well, I just have to see what that&#39;s about.&quot; <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: You&#39;re so sweet! A friend of mine runs a magazine here called <i>Next</i> and it&#39;s very cool. What brings you to New York? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: I have a new CD out that&#39;s all acoustic. I had an album last year called <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> and it won the bluegrass album of the year. People were really getting into me going back to my roots and doing a lot of the acoustic things so we thought we&#39;d follow it up with a new one. The title of this one is called <i>Little Sparrow</i>, and don&#39;t go writin&#39; that it&#39;s for the birds [laughs]. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I love that image, Dolly. I know it&#39;s always very important for you to get back to those country roots. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, it is and this is the kind of music that I actually sing the best, but I never could make a living at it. I had to get out and make some money so I could afford to go back and sing like I was poor again [laughs]. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: So what&#39;s on your New York schedule? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: I&#39;m doing Conan [O&#39;Brien] tonight, in the morning I have a series of interviews and then I&#39;m heading back to Nashville tomorrow at noon. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: On your bus? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Bust or bus? <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Bus! [Laughs.] How is your bus? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, they&#39;re fine, all three of them, the bus and the bust. But actually, I enjoy the bus. I use it for my dressing room when I travel. I get a lot of work done. I write a lot when I&#39;m on the bus and so it&#39;s wonderful to use it when I&#39;m out on location like this. It gives me a good dressing room. I can always depend on my bus. <br><b>ROSS</b>: You covered some pretty non-traditional songs on this album. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: I did, but I did them all in this traditional sound that we&#39;re doing. I call the music I&#39;m making now &quot;blue mountain music&quot; because it&#39;s a combination of bluegrass and mountain music. That just seemed like a good phrase for it, but yes, I took the old Cole Porter song, &quot;I Get A Kick Out Of You,&quot; and did it up-tempo. I blue-grassed it up with fiddles, banjos, and mandolins. And it turns out that it&#39;s gettin&#39; so much response just because of the difference of it. I did another one called &quot;Shine&quot; from the rock group Collective Soul. It&#39;s a song I&#39;ve always loved. I thought it would be fun to just take two or three things like that and then add the seven songs I wrote on the album. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I love the songs that you write. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Good, well I like to write. That&#39;s my favorite thing that I do.<br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I mean, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; is such a wonderful song. And you were so smart to keep the rights. You&#39;re a great business person on top of everything else, Dolly. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I don&#39;t know about that, I&#39;ve been lucky too. But I do like the business end of the business. I&#39;ve always enjoyed seeing how things work and making them work and I&#39;ve always tried to make sure I kept my own publishing with my songs. I have about three thousand copyrights, I&#39;ve been writing since I was seven-years-old. I have a pretty good little publishing company going, but you don&#39;t need but a few. If you have one or two like, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; you can make a good living. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I&#39;ll bet you can, I wish I had an, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t have to paint all the time. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Yeah, but you&#39;re great. I&#39;d like to think I could write like you paint, but we both look at our paintings and our songs like our children. We hope they&#39;ll support us when we&#39;re old. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: That is so true, but since that&#39;s so far away, we don&#39;t have to worry about things like that yet. So now, how is everything in Nashville? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I live in Nashville, but I also have a home in L.A. I spend about half my time in Nashville, half my time in L.A. Now and then I get up to New York to do some business, but I&#39;m having a good time at Dollywood, as you know, that&#39;s the theme park. We&#39;re going into our sixteenth season. We open on April 7th and 8th. That&#39;s our big grand opening. We&#39;re having a Festival of Nations; the whole world is coming to Dollywood and they&#39;re going to be there for a month, bringing all their customs, their clothing, their food. We also have our $20 million dollar water park that we&#39;re opening on May 19th. It&#39;s called Dolly&#39;s Splash Country. It covers several acres. It&#39;s our biggest expansion since we started. We tried to keep the environment looking beautiful, so we built all these beautiful waterfalls and slides and pools. It&#39;s in the mountains there, in the Smokies. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Dolly, you know it&#39;s been one of my big objectives in the last few years to get to Dollywood. I haven&#39;t done it, and I know I&#39;ve said it to you lots of times, I&#39;m dying to go to Dollywood. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: This would be a good year for you to come, you should get Sandy Gallin, he&#39;s been there before. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I know, I&#39;m going to get all my gay friends that love you so much, Dolly. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Some of the best friends I have in this whole world are gay, and I just have some wonderful friends. I&#39;ve always said if I hadn&#39;t been a woman, I&#39;d definitely been a drag queen and you know that to be a fact. I love all people. I just have a great rapport with gay people because somehow they&#39;re sort of like me. They just have a freer spirit. They accept themselves easier than most people.<br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I know, that&#39;s true. Like I said before, you&#39;re great. You like to stay with your roots and you really, really have kept your humility and that&#39;s what&#39;s been so beautiful about you and your performances and your writing for all these years. And I know how close you are with your family. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Yes, you know I have a bunch. There&#39;s 12 kids in our family. I just lost my father a few weeks ago and I&#39;m still really having a lot of trouble with that. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I&#39;m sorry to hear that. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: He went unexpected.<br><br><b>ROSS</b>: How old was he? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: He was 79, but he had never been sick. He had a stroke and he died within two weeks, so at least we felt like we had him all those good years. But he had a good life. I was happy that if he had to go, that he didn&#39;t really suffer that much, but we miss him a lot. You&#39;re right, I&#39;m very close to my family and I stay very true to my roots. And talking about our gay friends, too, I think it&#39;s great when people accept themselves for exactly who they are and accept other people. I think that&#39;s the key to happiness and success. It doesn&#39;t matter who you are, as long as you do <i>that</i> really good. We&#39;re all God&#39;s children. He loves us all the same. We have to learn to love each other and ourselves a little better. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I can&#39;t figure out why more people don&#39;t have your attitude, Dolly. I really mean it. Now that we have this Republican administration, I don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t adopt your philosophy. Then everybody really would be bi-partisan. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I think a lot of people are not comfortable with who they are, so they have to kind of take the attention off of themselves and try to judge and criticize other people. Then you don&#39;t get a chance to see who they are. I&#39;m very comfortable with who I am, so I accept all people as if that&#39;s who I am as well. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I mean, just from the fact that you come from Tennessee-that&#39;s not an area that is known for its hospitality to gay people. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, no. There&#39;s a lot of prejudice in the South and there&#39;s prejudice everywhere. But I just always had a very open heart. I think God had a plan for me. I always try and find out all the things he might have had in mind. I didn&#39;t want to let God down. I feel like for me to judge other people and to not accept people as they are, that would be a sin against my spirit, my talent and my human decency. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: That honesty comes through in your work and I really think that&#39;s why gay people respond to you and why they&#39;re such a devoted audience and you&#39;re such an icon. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I do have a lot of fun, in fact, just changing the subject ever so slight, I had a good time when I did Bette Midler&#39;s show. I know she also is another one that the gay community really accepts. We had such a good time doing her show, that we talked about doing a dance record together. Some of my records are made into dance records, especially in the gay clubs, you know. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I know, I love them! &quot;Peace Train&quot; was one of my favorite songs of all time, the way <i>you</i> did it. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: But wouldn&#39;t it be fun for me and Bette to do a dance album? <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: You wouldn&#39;t be able to turn the crowds away. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: I know, so I&#39;m thinking we might do that at some point in time. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: When are you going to perform again in New York? <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: I plan to do a few concerts. I&#39;m going to do Carnegie Hall. We tried to do that on Valentine&#39;s Day, but we couldn&#39;t pull it together. Sometime in the next few months we&#39;re going to try and do that big show. In the meantime, we&#39;re going to do a few concerts scattered around this coming year. I&#39;m going to be doing some TV movies of the week. We&#39;ve got the Dollywood opening, got the <i>Little Sparrow</i> album and I believe that&#39;s going to pretty much keep me busy. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Well, listen, everything sounds wonderful in your life. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I&#39;m thrilled to death that I got to talk to you. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Well, please, next time you&#39;re here I want to come hear you. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Oh, you will, but If you&#39;re up tonight, you can watch me on Conan. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: I will, I&#39;ll stay up. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, I love you! <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Thank you, Dolly, and I love you too. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Getting off my interview, what are you painting, what&#39;s your show, what are you doing? <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Well, I&#39;m actually having a show in May at Mary Boone&#39;s gallery in Chelsea. I&#39;m making new big paintings, they&#39;re like flower petals kind of falling down. I&#39;m working slowly. I&#39;ve been in the city and I&#39;ve been out in the country. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Let me know when the show is, because I&#39;d love to come. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Well, for sure, I&#39;ll make sure I send you an invitation. <br><br><b>DOLLY</b>: Well, alright, now I&#39;m going to go practice with Conan. <br><br><b>ROSS</b>: Okay Dolly, thank you, you&#39;re so very wonderful and generous as always. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">March 20, 2001</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Showing Her Roots</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Dolly Parton heads for the hills</b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>New Yorkers aren&#39;t easily impressed. But here in the lobby of the swanky Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, a fur-clad matron speaks breathlessly into her cell phone. &quot;You&#39;ll nevah guess who I just saw upstairs,&quot; she rasps. &quot;Dolly PAW-ton!&quot;<b><br><br></b></blockquote>Obviously, even jaded city folk love Dolly. <br><br>A few minutes later, Dolly giggles at this story. New York City doesn&#39;t scare her one bit. &quot;I like it here,&quot; she gushes. &quot;I had an apartment here for 20 years. I&#39;m comfortable anywhere, actually. I feel like I can fit anywhere.&quot; <br><br>She might just as well be talking about her music. After issuing pop, country and bluegrass collections over the last few years, her new album, <i>Little Sparrow</i>, on Sugar Hill Records, is a return to her mountain roots. <br><br>&quot;I call this <i>real</i> mountain music,&quot; says Dolly, wearing a decidedly unmountainy, skintight black pantsuit. &quot;It&#39;s more mountain than bluegrass. Actually I only did a couple of bluegrass things like the Louvin Brothers&#39; &#39;I Don&#39;t Believe You&#39;ve Met My Baby.&#39;&quot; <br><br>In addition to six Parton originals like the bouncy &quot;Marry Me&quot; and the mournful title tune, Dolly wandered into left field for some songs. &quot;I did some things using bluegrass instruments, like &#39;I Get A Kick Out Of You,&#39; the Frank Sinatra song,&quot; she says. &quot;My husband, Carl, owns all kinds of records, and he really likes that song. The last time I heard it, I thought, &#39;I wonder how it would be if we did it up-tempo?&#39; And people seem to already be taking to it.&quot; <br><br>Another off-the-wall choice was &quot;Shine,&quot; a rock hit by the Atlanta alternative band Collective Soul. &quot;My husband was playing a rock &#39;n&#39; roll station in the car and that song came on,&quot; she recalls. &quot;We both just looked at each other, and I said, &#39;I love that song.&#39; So we stopped at Tower Records and bought it. <br>&quot;I was thinking &#39;I&#39;d love to record that,&#39; but it had that really heavy guitar. So I thought, &#39;You know, that could be done really simple, using a mandolin at the beginning instead of a guitar.&#39; And the song&#39;s melody is so beautiful for bluegrass harmonies.&quot; <br><br>A spiritual thread runs throughout <i>Little Sparrow</i>. Dolly included the gospel standard &quot;In The Sweet By And By,&quot; with vocal help from Mair&eacute;ad N&iacute; Mhaonaigh of the Irish band Altan. &quot;She&#39;s wonderful,&quot; says Dolly. &quot;I wanted to have that Irish sound, and she loves singing like that. Someone in her family translated that part into Gaelic. <br>&quot;I&#39;ve been singing that song since I was a little kid,&quot; she continues. &quot;I thought, &#39;That is really pretty. I wonder how it would be if we slowed it down?&#39; It came out nice.&quot;  <br><br>Dolly&#39;s latest album is only one of the many projects she juggling. &quot;I&#39;m doing a remake of <i>The Solid Gold Cadillac</i>, the old Judy Holliday movie, this spring,&quot; she says. &quot;Then I&#39;m doing another TV movie, <i>Heavens To Betsy</i>. It&#39;s a story of mine that I&#39;ve been trying to get going for years. It&#39;s a fun thing, a gospel musical.&quot; <br><br>Unfortunately, Dolly&#39;s joy while making her new album was tempered by the death of her father, Lee, in November. &quot;It wasn&#39;t like we expected it,&quot; she says sadly. &quot;He had a stroke and in two weeks he was dead. I&#39;ve never known that kind of grief, because I had never lost a parent. We miss him so much. <br><br>&quot;I dedicated the album to Daddy. I thought that was about the best thing I could do for him. He always used to call me his &#39;little songbird.&#39; So this is the last thing I got to do for Daddy. <br>He liked this album. He liked the old, simple songs.&quot; Suddenly, she lets out a laugh. &quot;He used to say, &#39;You sing these songs better than anybody. I don&#39;t know why you wanna bother with that ol&#39; rock &#39;n&#39; roll stuff.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Dolly took his advice to heart. <br>&quot;I thought, &#39;It&#39;s just time to do what&#39;s right, and it&#39;s time to do what I feel,&#39;&quot; she says. &quot;But there&#39;ll never be anything that I do as well as this music, that I love as much, or that comes out of me as real.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Mountain Press</font><br><font size="2">April 7, 2001</font><br><br><div class="h3"><b>Dolly Welcomes World</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Festival Of Nations Begins</b></font></div><br><img align="bottom" alt="Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Mountain Press" width="455"></div><br>PIGEON FORGE, Media members flocked to Dollywood Friday for a sneak peak at this year&#39;s month-long Festival of Nations at the theme park, which opens to the general public today.<br><br>Entering its sweet-16 season, Dollywood is kicking off the new millennium with international flair and flavor. The festival begins at 10 a.m. with the Parade of Nations through the park. <br><br>Dancers, singers, actors, athletes and musicians from across the globe will be performing for park guests, who can indulge their appetites with international entrees such as alligator, ostrich, elk, kangaroo and caribou to name a few. <br><br>&quot;Hopefully, who knows, it may become an annual thing where we have them every year for at least a month,&quot; Parton said to the crowd after performing &quot;9 To 5&quot; with the Stavropolye Cossacks of Russia, one of the international groups now performing. <br><br>The Cossacks combine music, song and dance to portray the people&#39;s ancient legend that there was once a time when people could fly. Their Friday performance combined grace and strength, which awed the crowd and brought admiration from Parton. <br><br>&quot;They work very hard,&quot; she said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t work that hard, and I don&#39;t think I could work that hard.&quot; <br><br>Parton, who was dressed in a Russian costume, said the month-long festival can&#39;t hurt efforts for world peace. <br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a lot of unrest in all the world,&quot; Parton said. &quot;One thing people do have in common is music, and food, and their cultures. I think people as individuals are wonderful. <br><br>&quot;We just felt at least we could show our generosity and our hospitality by inviting these people from all over the world. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could just all live like this all over the world and that&#39;s all there was to it? It&#39;d be nice, but who knows, this is a start. We might just bridge a few gaps of our own.&quot; <br><br>Parton, who will participate in Saturday&#39;s opening day parade, is also scheduled to attend the 7 p.m. International Jam with various Festival of Nations performers. <br><br>Dolly&#39;s Splash Country, Parton&#39;s new water park located next to Dollywood, is scheduled to open May 19. She also plans to attend the grand opening of the $20 million attraction. <br><br>Friday, Parton took time to talk about her entertainment career as well. In May, she will begin filming a Disney movie in Los Angeles titled &quot;Frank McCluskey: C.I.&quot; The movie, about a claims investigator, is scheduled for release in Spring 2002. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a comedy, it&#39;s crazy and it&#39;s slap-sticky,&quot; said Parton. &quot;I play the mother. My husband, which Randy Quaid I think is going to play that part, is like an Evil Knievel type guy.&quot; <br><br>She said the husband is injured performing a motorcycle stunt, and she is left raising the children by herself. <br><br>&quot;He&#39;s been in a coma for 20 years, so I&#39;m over-protective of my boys,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s just so stupid that it&#39;s funny.&quot; <br><br>She also plans to record many more mountain and bluegrass tunes in the future. She has no plans to tour anytime soon, but she will be performing frequently on TV. <br><br>&quot;I think everything starts with a dream, and it was always my dream to be a star,&quot; she said. &quot;I just think you always have to continue to dream, and I wake up in a new world every day, sort of like a goose.&quot; <br><br>Parton said she enjoys helping Sevier County&#39;s economy by doing her part, but she said she doesn&#39;t deserve all the distinction. <br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t take credit for everything that&#39;s been done here,&quot; she said. &quot;I think we owe most of the credit to the Great Smoky Mountains. The national park was doing pretty good before I came along. <br><br>&quot;Although, I&#39;ve got my own set of mountains.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Knoxville News-Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">September 15, 2001</font><br><br><b>Parton accentuates positive in trying times</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE, Dolly Parton was smiling, flirting with fans and singing Friday at Dollywood because she says it&#39;s during trying times like these that entertainers need to stay positive. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s hard,&quot; she said during an interview at Dollywood. &quot;That&#39;s when you really need to stay upbeat if you can. ... It&#39;s always good to help the other people that can&#39;t get up from this. <br><br>&quot;I think everybody is dealing with this tragedy in their own kind of way, based on what they feel and what their own fears and insecurities are. I&#39;m a very patriotic person, but I also know that when things are at their worst that I need to be at my best.&quot; <br><br>Parton has been in her native Sevier County for the past week filming for a new Dollywood simulation ride that debuts next spring and appearing in segments with popular British late-night talk show host Graham Norton. <br><br>For Norton, host of the British Broadcasting Corp.&#39;s &quot;So Graham Norton,&quot; the terrorist attacks may delay his return to England. <br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t think of any safer place in the world to be than here,&quot; Norton said. &quot;It&#39;s so odd to be here, sort of surreal. <br><br>&quot;The day it happened, the park was shut, and we were filming here. Instead of music being piped through, there were news reports being piped through. I had my lunch on a bench listening to news reports coming out of a stone in a flower bed.&quot;<br> Between filming comedy bits, Norton and Parton talked about the attacks. <br><br>&quot;She feels the same way as everyone else. It&#39;s an awful, awful thing,&quot; he said. &quot;The day it happened, we were all in a very, very weird place.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s Dixie Stampede had a sold-out show on Tuesday night, hours after the destruction of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon. <br><br>&quot;It was incredibly emotional there - really charged,&quot; said Norton, who attended the show. &quot;The performers on the horses were crying, and since then working has been OK. People needed a release from what was happening.&quot; <br><br>Dollywood officials had cautioned Friday that Parton did not want to talk about the attacks during an interview with the News-Sentinel. However, the entertainer was open about how she was feeling. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m in a good place in my life,&quot; Parton said. &quot;I basically have a happy heart.&quot; <br><br>The recent national crisis makes Parton &quot;very emotional&quot; and stimulates her urge to write songs. <br><br>&quot;Everybody deals with this differently. I deal with it very internally,&quot; she said. &quot;I see how everybody else deals with it, and I am able to write about their emotions. It allows me a way to express (sorrow), not just for myself, but for the people who can&#39;t put (their emotions) into words. It&#39;s very strange and deep places where I am going.&quot;<br>Because of the crisis Tuesday, Parton had postponed announcing Dollywood&#39;s $10 million expansion project for next spring. It will include a simulation ride, a museum focused on her career and a restaurant. The expansion will be near the theme park&#39;s &#39;50s-era section. <br><br>Parton will enter Mickey Mouse country when she builds a new Dixie Stampede theater near Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla., next year. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Good Housekeeping</font><br><font size="2">November 2001<br></font><b><br></b><div class="h3"><b>The First Annual &quot;Seal Of Approval&quot; Awards</b></div> <div class="h4"><font size="1"><b>Remembering her rural roots<br><br><br></b></font></div></div><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Good Housekeeping" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Good Housekeeping" width="455"></div><br><br>Most children growing up the way Dolly Parton did, poor and isolated on hard-luck farms tucked in the foothills of Tennessee&#39;s Smoky Mountains, never found their way out. But even though a trip into Sevierville, the nearest town, was something Dolly&#39;s family managed only a few times a year, as a little girl she never doubted the existence of a grander world, a world she planned to experience one day. The reason she could dream such big dreams, Dolly says now, was because she loved to read. <br><br>&quot;The only thing I ever saw growing up was poor people in overalls and brogan shoes and ragged clothes,&quot; Dolly, 55, says. &quot;But in my books I would read about kings and queens with their velvet clothes and big diamond rings. That&#39;s how I knew there was a world outside the Smoky Mountains. And because I felt comfortable in those stories, I knew it would be OK for me to go out in that world. My books kept me from being afraid.&quot; <br><br>For the past six years, Dolly has been quietly returning that gift to the children of her hometown. Every month, she sends a new hardcover book to each preschool-aged child living in Sevier County, all 6,700 of them. Called Dolly Parton&#39;s Imagination Library, the program has already mailed out 200,000 books. <br><br>&quot;As a kid, I read anything I could get my hands on,&quot; Dolly recalls. &quot;Even when my aunts and uncles would send up old newspapers and catalogs for us to use as toilet paper, I would always read them first.&quot; But the impulse behind the program came as much from Dolly&#39;s understanding of the value of education as from her love of storybooks. &quot;My dad happened to be one of the smartest people I ever knew,&quot; Dolly says, &quot;but he couldn&#39;t read, and he always felt so trapped by that. I just thought it would be a great thing for other people not to have to suffer through.&quot; <br><br>The Dollywood Foundation also gives college scholarships and develops programs designed to reduce the school dropout rate in Sevier County. And Dolly has personally insisted on two major features of the Imagination Library (which is partnered with publisher Penguin Putnam), both designed to prevent the stigma of poverty from being attached to the giveaway books. <br><br>First, books are given to all children in the community, regardless of income. <br>&quot;You don&#39;t have to be from a poor family to get free books,&quot; Dolly explains. <br><br>Second, the books are delivered directly to each child. &quot;I know these country people. A lot of mothers don&#39;t even drive,&quot; Dolly says. So the books come to the children every month in the mail. Unexpectedly, kids seem to love this feature best. &quot;It turns out these little kids think that I put the books in their mailbox personally, just for them, almost like the Easter bunny,&quot; says Dolly with a delighted giggle. &quot;I&#39;m like a fairy godmother to them. The kids even have a name for me: Now I&#39;m the Book Lady!&quot; <br><br>Last year, the unqualified success of the Imagination Library led Dolly to expand her efforts beyond the hills of east Tennessee. So many other communities across the United States have signed on, almost 20 in the second half of this year alone, that the program expects that it will have distributed roughly 300,000 books by the end of 2001. Though communities interested in replicating the program do need to come up with their own funding, the Dollywood Foundation will provide the books, as well as packaging and shipping, for only $27 per year per child. <br><br>Meanwhile, the little mountain girl who once dreamed of being a princess is still making big plans: &quot;At some point in time, we really hope to do this for children all over the world,&quot; Dolly says. And for the Book Lady of Sevierville, that doesn&#39;t seem like an impossible dream at all.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Music</font><br><font size="2">Winter 2000</font><br><b><br>Hurricane Dolly</b><br><font size="1"><b>Thirty-five years after moving to Nashville, Dolly Parton remains as refreshing and innovative as most acts half her age.</b></font><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Music" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Music" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>As usual, Dolly Parton is a whirlwind of creative activity. At the age of 54, Parton is reinventing herself again with a sparkling new bluegrass album. <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> finds Parton drawing on her Appalachian heritage in a fresh, yet staunchly traditional, manner. This move follows 1998&#39;s <i>Hungry Again</i>, a similarly gusty gamble she recorded with young alternative-country musicians.</blockquote>  <br><br>Parton&#39;s lovely <i>Trio II</i> album with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt became a surprise sales success of 1999, even without radio airplay. She starred in <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i>, a Lifetime network movie based on a song she recorded for the <i>Hungry Again</i> album. And, as Parton became a 1999 inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame, she continued to push beyond artistic borders by joining outrageous pop star Boy George on a disco recording. She&#39;s also developing a gospel musical, <i>Heavens to Betsy</i>, and keeps a guiding hand over her Dollywood theme park, one of the biggest tourist attractions in the United States. <br><br>And, as always, she greets each interview with fresh quips and a ready wit.<br><br> <b>Country Music:</b> There is a line in &quot;Blue Valley Songbird&quot; that goes, &quot;She&#39;s a little bit crazy.&quot; Are you? <br><b>DP:</b> I think that all creative people are a little bit nuts. There&#39;s a great line that Waylon Jennings sings: &quot;I&#39;ve always been crazy, but it&#39;s kept me from going insane.&quot; That is one of the greatest lines, and so true. I&#39;m totally nuts, but in a good way, because I have fun. <br>And I think I&#39;m a strange person in that I enjoy my own company. I&#39;m so crazy I&#39;m entertained by it, if that makes any sense. I think, <i>Oh my Lord, I can&#39;t believe you did that</i>. Sometimes I&#39;ll walk away from an interview and go, &quot;I didn&#39;t say that, did I?&quot; <br><br><b>CM:</b> Tell me about going into the Country Music Hall of Fame. <br><b>DP:</b> When I got the call, it was June. Two of my sisters, Cassie and Rachel, and two of their kids, Hannah and Rebecca, who are like 11 and 13, had come out to L.A. They were in the kitchen and I was in my office, which is off the kitchen, when I got this call. I started screaming. They thought somebody was dead or something. They all came running in. So I got to share the moment with my family. My heart was just overjoyed and overwhelmed. <br>My first joke was, &quot;I thought I&#39;d have to be as ugly as Porter and as old as Willie Nelson before I&#39;d be put in.&quot; I did think, <i>I&#39;m not old enough to be in the Country Music Hall of Fame</i>, but I guess I am. It&#39;s like being inducted into sainthood or something. I am in the Hall of Fame with the saints. Me, little Dolly Parton from the Smoky Mountains in there with Hank Williams and all those people who have done so much, it&#39;s chillings. It&#39;s humbling.And I&#39;m glad to go in while I&#39;m still young enough, active enough and alive enough that I can enjoy it. I get to see it happen, feel it happen, be part of it while it&#39;s happening. <br><br><b>CM:</b> Your bluegrass performance was one of the best moments of the telecast. <br><b>DP:</b> It&#39;s cool to be going into the Hall of Fame and at the same time doing new music. If you think this means I&#39;m done and that this is putting me in a rocking char, you can forget it. If it does, you can just put wheels on my rockin&#39; chair, &#39;cause I am gonna rock &#39;n&#39; roll. With the bluegrass album, I feel like I&#39;m just starting my career. <br><br><b>CM:</b> How did <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> come about? <br><b>DP:</b> All of my people played fiddles, mandolins, banjos and guitars. We defined our music as &quot;mountain music.&quot; The emotion is the same for mountain music and bluegrass. That &quot;high lonesome sound&quot; is just the mourning of the soul, like being part of a high lonesome wind, going deep into the soul and expressing it. <br>Steve Buckingham, who has produced so many of my records, invited me to dinner. He said, &quot;They ran a survey of some sort asking people who they would most like to do a bluegrass album. Do you know what the results were? Dolly Parton, 10 to one.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t we just do one then?&quot; Six weeks later we were done with it. <br><br><b>CM:</b> Are you in a good place in your life? <br><b>DP:</b> They say wisdom comes with age, and I think peace does as well. I don&#39;t have to do anything, so I will not do anything if it doesn&#39;t feel right to me. I am willing to work until I fall over, but I don&#39;t have to. <br>I have freedom now. I&#39;m not tied up to a record label. I am managing myself, so I don&#39;t have to ask managers. Since I have gotten older and not been played on the radio, I don&#39;t have to write to please a disc jockey. I&#39;m not writing to please anybody but myself. If I want to do a bluegrass album, I have the freedom. I&#39;ve lived long enough to earn it, and I guess deserve it. I&#39;m gonna claim it whether I deserve it or not! <br>I feel good and I don&#39;t look bad for my age. I look like a cartoon anyway, so what difference does it make? I&#39;m always gonna look like Dolly, like a freak. But I&#39;m the best freak I&#39;ve ever been.

(Dolly has also released, on Buddha Records, two classics, <i>Jolene</i> and <i>Heartbreaker</i>.)  <b><br><br>Country Song Roundup: What happened the minute that you first heard that you were going to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame?<br></b> <br><b>Dolly Parton:</b> I wasn&#39;t expecting it now, because in my mind, I&#39;m still young and still working and active. My family was out visiting me in June in L.A., my two sisters and their two daughters, and they were in the kitchen and I was in my office when they called me from the Country Music Hall of Fame to tell me that I was going to be inducted. Well, I just screamed, and my sisters came running &#39;cause they thought somebody in the family had died or something, &#39;cause they&#39;d heard the phone ring and me scream, but they saw that I wasn&#39;t sad and I said, &quot;No, it&#39;s OK, I&#39;m just going in the Hall of Fame.&quot; <br><br><b>CSR: Many female acts of today list you as their musical inspiration. What are your thoughts on this, and what do you think of hot new acts like the Dixie Chicks?<br><br></b> <b>DP:</b> I see the Dixie Chicks as these great talented young people, and I see myself as an old Southern hen that has hopefully done some things right. But I&#39;m always so honored and so flattered, and I&#39;m surprised at some of the people that have said that I&#39;m an influence, because I think those people are very talented in their own way. But to think that I&#39;ve been around long enough to have left some sort of impact and to have influenced somebody is always a great honor. Just like the night that Shania Twain got the Entertainer of the Year, and that being her big night and that she in a moment like that would even mention my name. I mean, I was just knocked over with that. It makes me just feel proud in my heart. <br><br><b>CSR: <i>Did you ever get to meet Shania Twain?</i></b> <br><br><b>DP:</b> No, when Shania mentioned my name I was on my way home. As soon as I finished my song with Vince Gill that night, I headed out the door as soon as I could, you know how you do to miss the traffic when there&#39;s a big event. So I didn&#39;t see her say that, and when I got home the TV was on and I saw her making that speech when I walked into my kitchen and I thought, &quot;She said my name on television.&quot; I just about fell over! So the next day, I sent her flowers and a telegram that said I was so sorry that I hadn&#39;t met her and I didn&#39;t know she wanted to meet me, and I told her that I would love to get with her and that I&#39;d love to write with her, maybe sing, or if nothing else just say hi. Then she sent me back a note saying that she would love to get together. <br><br><b>CRS: You are always working on something new; what&#39;s coming up this year of 2000?</b> <br><br><b>DP:</b> I&#39;m doing a Christmas movie, a feature film for next Christmas, and it&#39;s called <i>The Christmas Rap</i>. I&#39;ve also got a lot of production things through my company like a CBS movie of the week, a gospel musical called <i>Heavens To Betsy</i> and I&#39;m doing a remake of <i>Solid Gold Cadillac</i> for Turner Networks. So, as usual, I have a lot of things happening this year. <br><br><b>CSR: Dolly, the world sees you as a superstar. Do you ever look at yourself and think, &quot;Man, I&#39;m a big star&quot;?</b> <br><br><b>DP:</b> I&#39;m a person that does not think of myself as a star. I think of myself as a working girl. Every day I wake up with a new dream. This is my gift, so therefore it&#39;s my responsibility and my job. I just try to make the most of all the things that God has given me. I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m a likable star. I think of myself as a real person, and sometimes when people make over me or say something like Shania did, I&#39;m just shocked, I really am. I&#39;m like, &quot;Gosh, they&#39;re talking about me.&quot; I really do. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Oxford American</font><br><font size="2">July/August 2000</font><br><b><br>Dealer&#39;s Choice: Lunch With Dolly Parton</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Oxford American" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Oxford American" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>Would you rather hang out with a swarm of New South Writers or Dolly Parton, queen bee of Music City?<font size="4"><b><br><br></b></font></blockquote>I was lucky to have another engagement in Nashville, an invitation to lunch with Dolly Parton. This is definite name-dropping, but no kind of A-list boasting. Of the several writers in my family, one of them is Parton&#39;s favorite writer, and it&#39;s not me. After only thirty seconds in a crushing hammerlock, with my knee wedged firmly against her spine, my wife was kind enough to suggest that I join her and Dolly for lunch. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t have missed it. One thing New South writers could agree upon is that the marketplace starves talent and smothers genius. Every effort to rise above poverty seems to involve humiliating compromise with a ruthless establishment of philistines and mercenaries. But Dolly Parton is a walking, glittering rebuttal to all this grousing (in which I often join) that the cream never rises to the top. <br><br>Sometimes it rises. Parton came to Nashville as a starstruck teenager, went through the wringer like all the country girls, and found herself in the deep and troubled waters of celebrity. Instead of drowning, she learned to swim real well, thank you. Pressed into a Grand Ole Opry stereotype, a singing version of <i>Li&#39;l Abner</i>&#39;s Daisy Mae, she took it to a level beyond imitation: &quot;The dumb blond act didn&#39;t bother me because I know I&#39;m not dumb,&quot; she said, &quot;and I know I&#39;m not blond, either.&quot; <br><br>She knew, as well, that she could sing and write songs a little better than the competition and that the business side didn&#39;t scare her. (&quot;Many an old boy has found out too late that I look like a woman but think like a man.&quot;) At fifty-four she looks like a woman who loves her work, her fans, and the considerable responsibility of being herself, even though she can&#39;t walk into a restaurant without drawing a round of applause and a couple of hard-breathing autograph hounds. <br><br>&quot;They love for me to touch them,&quot; she told us after the waitress requested a laying on of hands, and she isn&#39;t stingy with herself. Her latest CD, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>, wins extravagant praise from the most exacting critics; she also markets wigs and cosmetics. A serious reader and a philanthropist for literacy programs, Parton may be more comfortable with Nashville&#39;s splintered consciousness, pickers and poets, rural roots and rhinestones, than anyone I&#39;ve ever met. <br><br>She&#39;s remind me to say that she looks great, too. Where her appearance is concerned, Parton takes a humorous, creative approach to that confining word <i>real</i>. What you see is not exactly what time and gravity would have produced, unchecked. In her autobiography she gives her plastic surgeon&#39;s phone number and writes, &quot;My spirit is too beautiful and alive to live in some dilapidated old body if it doesn&#39;t have to.&quot; She doesn&#39;t know how long it takes to do her hair, she says, because she&#39;s never there when it happens. Dolly wears her image the way Minnie Pearl wore her hat, like a favorite joke among old friends.  <br><br>I couldn&#39;t help noticing some new criteria for authenticity among the Writers of the New South. Where the Fugitive generation might have claimed ancestors who carried swords and planted cotton, these Subterfugitives claim recent ancestors who dipped snuff and lived without benefit of plumbing. One of my litmus tests for Southern authenticity would be the ability to appreciate the paradox of Dolly Parton: Beneath a blinding surface of deliberate, exaggerated, self-satirizing artifice lurks one of the most engagingly authentic individuals in the Nashville pantheon. Restoring her parents&#39; old home place in the Smoky Mountains, Dolly designed her new toilets as a faux outhouse, an irony she understands on the same level Robert Penn Warren would have understood it. She just gets a much bigger kick out of doing it.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal</font><br><font size="2">October 7, 2000<br></font><br><b>Stars Over Mississippi transforms Amory into Hollywood South</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Northeast Mississppi Daily Journal" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Northeast Mississppi Daily Journal" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>Friday night Gala to benefit Mary Kirkpatrick Haskell Scholarship Foundation<br><br></blockquote>AMORY, Spotlights and Dolly Parton&#39;s smile combined to light up Amory Friday night for the 2000 Stars Over Mississippi. <br><br>Excitement was high as more than 750 people attended the all-star gala at Amory Middle School for the chance to rub elbows with stars like Brooke Shields and Debbie Allen. <br><br>Even though she comes from West Palm Beach, Fla., where celebrity sightings are commonplace, Sherry Cuthbert quickly got caught up in the excitement. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m still celebrity-shocked. I think it&#39;s fabulous that all the stars come for such a wonderful cause,&quot; said Sherry Cuthbert, the wife of Amory native and Stars Over Mississippi corporate sponsor Doug Cuthbert. <br><br>Stars Over Mississippi benefits the Mary Kirkpatrick Haskell Scholarship Foundation, which was founded in 1991 by Sam Haskell in honor of his mother. More than $1 million has been raised for scholarships for Mississippi students. <br><br>Haskell, his wife and former Miss Mississippi Mary Donnelly Haskell and their two children were greeted with enthusiastic applause as they entered the Gala tent. <br><br>The crowd was equally appreciative as other big stars arrived for the evening. <br><br>Among those donating their time to help the youth of Amory are actor and area native John Dye, Kathie Lee Gifford, Emmy winner Gary Collins, Mississippi&#39;s former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley, actor Gary Grubbs, area native and singer Guy Hovis, Broadway star and Ole Miss alumnus Laurie Gayle Stephenson and singer Marsha Tindall. <br><br>Super model Kathy Ireland was scheduled to be at the Gala but arrived late after missing her plane. She will be on hand for the concert and parade today. <br>&quot;I&#39;m disappointed I didn&#39;t get to see Kathy Ireland,&quot; said Don Still of Meridian. &quot;She was one of the ones I wanted to see.&quot; <br><br><br>There was also a bonus star Friday night. <br>Sean Jones, a former defensive end with the Green Bay Packers attended the event with Burt Cuthbert. <br> &quot;I&#39;m here to see what it&#39;s all about,&quot; Jones said. <br><br>Ruby Allen of Carthage clearly enjoyed the excitement of her first Stars Over Mississippi Gala. She attended with Amory resident Karen Gault and Carolyn Laird of Houston, Texas. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve been to all five of them,&quot; Gault said. &quot;It&#39;s going to be fantastic.&quot; <br><br>Dolly Parton gave early-comers a special treat. She was one of the first to arrive and was greeted with flash-bulbs and applause as well as the obligatory &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; <br><br>When Mary Ann Mobley arrived, she stopped to greet Amory resident Van Rogers, who had served as her driver during a previous Stars Over Mississippi. <br>&quot;I&#39;m so glad to see you,&quot; she said, then kissed Rogers on the cheek. &quot;You look great.&quot; <br><br>This year, Rogers was assigned to drive actress Brooke Shields around Amory. <br>&quot;I picked her up this afternoon,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;She came down on a chartered bus from Memphis.&quot; <br><br>The air was alive with the smell of perfume and hairspray as men and women strutted in their finest clothes. Mallie Dennis, 10, of Booneville and Mary Elizabeth Myatt, 10, of Amory, confessed to spending an hour getting ready. <br>&quot;It only took me five minutes,&quot; quipped Myatt&#39;s mother, Terry. <br><br>The Gala tent erected on the grounds of Amory Middle School looked about as elegant as a tent can look. The poles were decorated with orange, green and purple drapes topped with intricate flower arrangements. <br><br>Candles, ferns and flowers created a warm atmosphere inside the tent while the temperature was unseasonably cool outside. <br><br>Numerous volunteers wearing black bow ties hustled from table to table seeing to everyone&#39;s needs. <br><br>Susan Martin, curriculum coordinator for the Amory School District, traded in her school books for a pitcher of tea for one night. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m in charge of the tea girls tonight,&quot; Martin said. &quot;Everyone is so proud of Sam Haskell and what he&#39;s done.

Then it was stalled by problems involving the singers&#39; different labels and conflicting schedules. <br><br>So Linda never thought Asylum Records would go for the idea of resurrecting the project. She suggested it anyway when record executives began to ask her about a new album. <br><br>&quot;I said, &#39;Would you be interested in our reassembling this record the way it was originally recorded,&#39; and to my complete shock, they said yes,&quot; Linda recalls. &quot;It was hard to do, though. It was the same can of worms all over again, different record labels, different managers, all the stuff they didn&#39;t want to mess with initially.&quot; <br><br>Aside from ironing out those complications, a lot of work had to be done to reconstruct the tracks, some of which the threesome had redesigned for individual projects. <br><br>&quot;Dolly had taken her tracks and put other harmonies on them and I had taken my tracks and done the same,&quot; Linda explains. &quot;When we took the record apart, we changed the harmony parts around, so they existed on backup reels, but they weren&#39;t in completed forms. <br><br>&quot;We had to find all those reels and reassemble the songs the way the harmonies had been and re-combine them. That was a lot of work.&quot; <br><br>And it was producer George Masenburg who carried most of the burden. &quot;Poor George,&quot; says Linda, &quot;had to track down parts. He&#39;d play me things over the phone and I&#39;d go, &#39;No, there used to be a part that would go this way.&#39; It was hard.&quot; <br><br>One thing that was no problem on the <i>Trio</i> recordings was getting three such accomplished artists to work in harmony. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve never had an argument about the music,&quot; Dolly states, looking at the other two for corroboration during an interview with COUNTRY WEEKLY. <br><br>&quot;The song would decide who would sing it,&quot; Emmylou explains. &quot;We would pretty much say, &#39;I think Dolly would sound good on lead on this,&#39; and &#39;Let&#39;s try this configuration with the harmonies.&#39; There were never fights like, &#39;You&#39;re singing too many leads.&#39; It was almost the opposite. We wanted to make sure everybody was represented, but the record was always first.&quot; <br> &quot;It always is,&quot; Linda interjects. &quot;The music is always served first.&quot; <br> &quot;We were all of one mind with that,&quot; Emmylou says. &quot;We didn&#39;t bring a song in thinking, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m going to sound great singing this.&#39; We were thinking of the trio. The trio becomes an entity and the question becomes, &#39;What facet of the trio is this song going to bring out?&#39; <br><br>&quot;When Dolly brought in the idea of doing &#39;After the Gold Rush,&#39; I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t bring it in with the thought that she was going to sing lead. She just loved the idea of the song. It was Linda and I who felt that her voice would give it the most spooky quality.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I brought it in thinking I was going to do the high part because they love to hear my high part,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;But Linda and Emmy always work so well together that I totally respect what their opinion is on a song and they know how to use me wisely. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m very sure of real straight-ahead country mountain kinds of songs and they trust my judgement on that, but they know more about some of the harmonies that were more involved,&quot; Dolly adds. &quot;If there&#39;s something I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s not, &#39;Don&#39;t tell me what to sing.&#39; I welcome their advice. It&#39;s, &#39;<i>Please</i> tell me what to sing.&#39;&quot; <br><br>&quot;What we didn&#39;t have were years on the bus and onstage together singing, where we learned how to phrase together and could anticipate each other&#39;s phrasing,&quot; Linda explains. &quot;And that&#39;s what took time in the studio. It doesn&#39;t have to be perfectly in tune, but we all have to be singing to the same pitch center. When that happens, it shimmers and I kept looking for the shimmer.&quot;<br><br>Was there time for any fun? &quot;There was nothing <i>but</i> time to have fun,&quot; Linda says. &quot;I made bread and Dolly made fried green tomatoes,&quot; she adds, her mouth watering at the memory. &quot;It was those drippings,&quot; she says, turning to Dolly. <br> &quot;Bacon grease,&quot; Dolly announces. <br> &quot;One night we decided we were going to grill steaks,&quot; Emmylou recalls. &quot;The studio mascot was this big yellow lab named Partner.&quot; <br> &quot;We called him Dolly Partner,&quot; Dolly interjects. <br> &quot;Mike, the cook, brought out six beautiful steaks on a platter and then went back into the kitchen to get something. In that minute, Partner ate all six steaks. He inhaled them.&quot; <br> &quot;I forgot about that,&quot; Dolly squeals, her hands up to her face, as Linda joins in the laughter. <br> &quot;I&#39;m sure Mike had picked out those steaks and marinated them just right, but it was just one of those moments that a dog waits for all of his life,&quot; Emmylou says.<br>&quot;We have a lot of fun together,&quot; Dolly adds. &quot;We exchange stories, we bring pictures in and articles we&#39;ve read. And there&#39;s a lot of girl stuff like, &#39;Have you seen this makeup?&#39; or &#39;Look at this hairdo.&#39; Linda takes it seriously, though. She&#39;s very hands-on in the studio. She is very strong in making sure it&#39;s all carried out well.&quot;<br>&quot;Linda understands sound and arrangements and is very involved in the mixing, too,&quot; Emmylou chimes in.<br>&quot;And Emmylou has such a great ear for music,&quot; Dolly states. &quot;Well, they both do, but Emmy just lives in those songs because she finds songs from everywhere, from 100 to 300 years ago. And I just like to sing with &#39;em. I&#39;m just glad to be a part of it.&quot;<br>Emmylou returns the compliment. &quot;When Linda and I first met, one of the first things we said to each other was, &#39;Who&#39;s your favorite girl singer?&#39; We both said, &#39;Dolly Parton.&#39;&quot; <br> Dolly beams with pride as Linda recounts her first meeting with Dolly in 1970. <br> &quot;Randy Scruggs took me down to the Grand Ole Opry and she came on and I just had to meet her.&quot;<br>&quot;She came backstage to say hi,&quot; Dolly recalls. &quot;She was getting to be the hottest thing going.&quot; <br> &quot;And Dolly was <i>already</i> the hottest thing,&quot; Linda interjects.<br>&quot;Yeah, I was hot, sweatin&#39; because there was no air conditioning,&quot; Dolly teases. &quot;And Emmy had recorded my &#39;Coat Of Many Colors.&#39;&quot;<br>&quot;I recorded that on my first album, so when I went to Nashville, a quick meeting was arranged,&quot; Emmylou recalls of their first introduction.<br>Linda and Emmylou became friends after meeting in Houston where they were both on tour. Then one day in 1975, Emmylou phoned Linda unexpectedly from her Los Angeles home. &quot;I said, &#39;You have to come over. Dolly is coming over,&#39;&quot; Emmylou says.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think I even stopped to put my shoes on,&quot; Linda recalls. &quot;It was a 45-minute drive from where I lived, but I think I got there in 15 minutes.&quot;<br>&quot;The first time we sang, it was not for a recording session and there were no cameras,&quot; Emmylou says.<br>&quot;We just wanted to feel it and see how it would sound,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;And when we heard our voices together that first time, we just said, &#39;We have to make a record!&#39;&quot; <br>Hearing their voices together is still overwhelming to them. <br>&quot;It always takes my breath away,&quot; Linda says.&quot;It does me, too,&quot; Dolly agrees. &quot;It makes me cry and it&#39;s not from any kind of an ego thing. I feel humbled to be on it. But when I hear it, I feel so many emotions that I cry. Of everything I&#39;ve ever done, I&#39;m proudest of the <i>Trio</i> albums.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t listen to <i>my</i> records, but I like to listen to this,&quot; Linda concurs. &quot;The two records the three of us have made really succeeded in what we set out to do. I&#39;ve made a lot of records where I didn&#39;t feel that way. It&#39;s like, &#39;Ugghhh, that&#39;s awful.&#39; It&#39;s hard for it to match the dream, but this matched the dream.&quot; <br><br>Since radio will not be serviced with any of <i>Trio II</i>&#39;s music, the singers are hoping word of its release will spread, especially among people who love acoustic and traditional music. <br><br>&quot;The three of us have a lot to pull from,&quot; Linda says. &quot;Dolly particularly focuses on it because she is the legitimate Appalachian thing, while it&#39;s music that Emmy and I have both studied, admired and emulated. When we have Dolly there with us, it becomes a great big thing because she&#39;s brings an authenticity to it that is just stunning.&quot; <br><br>Dolly adds, &quot;When it was agreed that this album was going to come out, I was very excited. But we didn&#39;t do it thinking it was necessarily going to be a big radio hit. We just want people to hear it.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">USA Today</font><br><font size="2">March 12, 1999</font><br><br><b>A &#39;Trio&#39; in tune with one another</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="USA Today" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="USA Today" width="455"></div><br><br>LOS ANGELES, Gathered around platters of fruit and pastries in an Elektra Records conference room, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton are chattering about television appearances, schedule conflicts and farm animals. <br> &quot;Linda has a pregnant goat named Pinky,&quot; Harris says. <br> Parton brightens. &quot;That sounds like a new song!&quot;<br><br>When this trio convenes, all trains of thought lead to Nashville. They just released <i>Trio II</i>, the sequel to 1987&#39;s Trio, which sold 2 million copies, yielded four hit singles and a Grammy. The new one, recorded in 1994 and shelved until the busy soloists could promote it, is off to a healthy start. It&#39;s No. 4 on Billboard&#39;s country chart. <br><br>They&#39;ve won over critics, but with country radio shunning traditional sounds, these musical triplets have no delusions of a sales bonanza. <br><br>&quot;In our separate careers, each of us had the chance to do what we wanted to do, which is extraordinary,&quot; Ronstadt says. &quot;There have been times I fell flat on my face, but at least I got the chance to try. So I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ll die if this album isn&#39;t a hit.&quot; <br><br>If Ronstadt is philosophical about the marketplace, Parton is indifferent. &quot;It&#39;s a big hit with us,&quot; she says. &quot;So it&#39;s already a success.&quot; <br><br>Mutual admiration bound them from the moment they first joined voices at Harris&#39; house in 1975. <br>&quot;It was an extraordinary sound,&quot; Harris recalls. &quot;Our three voices become something completely different from what any of us do as individuals. It blew me away.&quot; <br>Parton adds, &quot;That night, we all said we have to do a record someday.&quot; <br><br>Though that day didn&#39;t arrive for more than a decade, it was predated by plenty of cross-pollination. Their first three-part harmony was on Harris&#39; <i>Light of the Stable</i> in 1975. That year, Ronstadt recorded Parton&#39;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and sang on Harris&#39; <i>Queen of the Silver Dollar</i>. Parton recorded Harris&#39; &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot; in 1976 and sang on Ronstadt&#39;s <i>I Will Never Marry</i> in 1977. <br><br>Both Trio projects sprang from the threesome&#39;s love of songcraft, country tradition and each other.<br><br><blockquote>* Parton: &quot;Linda is such a perfectionist. I&#39;m like a butterfly on duck dung so it&#39;s hard for me to work with a perfectionist. My part is so good on this because they didn&#39;t allow me to run rampant like I usually do. Emmy has the greatest ear for songs. Linda is spectacular in the studio. I do whatever is left.&quot;<br><br>* Harris: &quot;Dolly has one of the purest traditional-sounding voices of all time, a beautiful instrument from the Appalachian tradition. To put that voice into a song like &#39;After the Goldrush&#39; brings the tradition forward without losing the connection. Linda has a wonderful sense of arrangement and added beautiful touches like the glass harmonica on &#39;After the Goldrush&#39; and strings on &#39;You&#39;ll Never Be the Sun.&#39;&quot; <br><br>* Ronstadt: &quot;Emmy stayed faithful to her original vision, which is based in tradition. Dolly is all about tradition and authenticity. This music is always connected to the root. You&#39;ve got to bring the ancestors with you. They inform you. You&#39;re part of that time continuum &mdash; genetically, biologically, emotionally and spiritually. That&#39;s got power. Dolly has potent ancestors to bring to this deal.&quot;<br><br></blockquote>Credited for clinging to roots, Parton surprised her colleagues when she proposed &quot;After the Goldrush,&quot; Neil Young&#39;s surreal musings on medieval times, Vietnam and space travel. Parton was familiar with U.K. band Prelude&#39;s 1974 version. <br>&quot;I loved the song, but I didn&#39;t know who wrote it,&quot; she says. &quot;Through the years, I became a Neil Young freak. I love the way he writes and just that old nasally tone.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s suggestion made the cut, as did the Carter Family&#39;s &quot;Lover&#39;s Return,&quot; Randy Newman&#39;s &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; and bluegrass-shaded tracks like John Starling&#39;s &quot;He Rode All the Way to Texas&quot; and Del McCoury&#39;s &quot;I Feel the Blues Movin&#39; In.&quot; Harmony prevailed at every juncture, from selecting songs and choosing parts to recording and picking cover art, photos of them at age 7. <br><br>The trio did hit a hitch over setting a release date, repeatedly postponed owing to outside obligations and family crises. <br>&quot;It caused a lot of hurt feelings, but we resolved that,&quot; Ronstadt says. &quot;We all felt there was a time when one didn&#39;t validate the others&#39; hard work. I think we valued it so much that it was crushing to see it sit on the shelf.&quot; <br><br>In hindsight, Parton sees the constant delays as a test of friendship. &quot;It was a blessing in disguise. We&#39;re like sisters. You have differences, your feelings get hurt, but it&#39;s OK. You&#39;re still family.&quot; <br><br>Will there be a triple crown from these country queens? All three hope to reunite for a third installment. &quot;One of the great things about this is that you realize you&#39;re not the center of the universe,&quot; Harris says. &quot;Sometimes, the career pressure of being me, me, me all the time is a big drain. With three of us, I&#39;m more relaxed. We nourish each other.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">March 23, 1999</font><br><br><b>Dolly celebrates her gospel roots and the not-so-charming snake</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>Some of Dolly Parton&#39;s most precious memories revolve around singing gospel as a child in her granddaddy&#39;s church, The House of Prayer.<br><br></blockquote>&quot;Gospel was an important part of life in the Smoky Mountains where I grew up,&quot; she says, &quot;and religion was a part of everyday life. We were brought up in a church where, if somebody wanted to get up and sing or shout, they did. There was a feeling of freedom there.&quot; <br>Dolly&#39;s reliving those early days during the taping of a TNN special, <i>Precious Memories</i>, which airs April 1 at 8 p.m. and April 3 at 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific.<br> For an hour, Dolly shares her love of gospel music, helped by bluegrass group Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station, gospel/bluegrass group The Cox Family and Dollywood&#39;s own group, Kingdom Heirs.<br>Many members of Dolly&#39;s own family are in the audience at a studio on the grounds of her Dollywood theme park.<br>&quot;There&#39;s something unique about family harmony singing, &#39;blood harmonies,&#39; we called &#39;em, and not surprisingly, many of our greatest groups are families who started out singing in church together,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;There even was a group called The Parton Family Traveling Band.&quot;<br>Dolly introduces her brother Randy and sister Rachel, who are members of the country/pop group Honey Creek. Dolly reminisces about their childhood and how they traveled to the local churches to sing. <br><br>As she starts one story, Dolly confides that it has a few bleeps in it, but, &quot;Daddy said it in church, so I reckon I can tell it now.<br><br>&quot;Our daddy hated church and snakes, but he loved to hear us sing. Daddy always said, &#39;I don&#39;t want my kids in church with no snakes.&#39; Our church didn&#39;t handle snakes, but a lot of people handled snakes as part of their religion. <br><br>&quot;Because Daddy didn&#39;t go to church, he would stand outside and look in the windows to hear us sing, whenever we traveled around. <br><br>&quot;One time we&#39;re at a little church, standing up in front of the congregation, singing our little hearts out and people are saying, &#39;Hallelujah, praise the Lord&#39; and shouting and we&#39;re thinking, &#39;We&#39;re really good and we&#39;re really touching these people.&#39; We didn&#39;t know the preacher behind us had pulled out a snake. <br><br>&quot;All of a sudden, Daddy comes down the aisle, and we had never ever seen Daddy in church, much less shouting. He was yelling, &#39;You get those bleeping snakes away from my bleeping kids, you bleep, bleeping, bleepster.&#39;&quot; <br>That cracks up the audience. <br><br>Another memory involves Dolly&#39;s mother. &quot;When I was little, we didn&#39;t always have the things to entertain us like kids do now,&quot; Dolly tells the audience. &quot;My mama used to sing to us and tell us stories about characters in the Bible, like Joseph and his coat of many colors. Now that I&#39;m all grown up, I realize how tough it must have been for her. <br><br>&quot;This is a little song I wrote about my mama and a little coat she made for me,&quot; Dolly adds as she launches into her hit &quot;Coat Of Many Colors&quot; with Alison Krauss and The Cox Family&#39;s Suzanne Cox. <br>&quot;When that song became a hit,&quot; Dolly discloses later, &quot;I went out and bought her a mink coat.&quot; <br><br>Another precious memory and, as Dolly declares before closing the show, &quot;There&#39;s a whole lot of America written in the poetry of gospel music, and whether you know it or not, there&#39;s a lot of gospel music in each and every one of us.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Citizen Tribune</font><br><font size="2">March 26, 1999</font><br><br><b>Gospel Special Full Of Dolly Parton&#39;s Precious Memories</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Citizen Tribune" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Citizen Tribune" width="455"></div><br><br>Gospel Music is worship with a melody. It can unify and ignite people to glory with voices raised in song, or calm a troubled heart with phrases gently whispered. Gospel Music has soul. And in the hands of one of country&#39;s premiere vocalists, Dolly Parton, it soars. <br><br>Parton lifts hearts, hands and spirits in a one-hour special &quot;Dolly Parton&#39;s Precious Memories,&quot; telecast on TNN Thursday, April 1st at 8 p.m. <br><br>&quot;Gospel was an important part of life in the Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee where I grew up and religion was a part of everyday life,&quot; Parton says in the show. &quot;We were brought up in a church where if somebody wanted to get up and sing or shout, they did. There was a feeling of freedom, and through that feeling, I came to know god.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s grandfather was an &quot;old time preacher man&quot; who taught the Word at the House of Prayer church. Parton grew up singing in churches with her siblings and two of them, Randy and Rachel, appear on the show to talk about their childhood and perform with their group, Honey Creek, popular performers at Dollywood, Parton&#39;s theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. <br><br>Other guests include Alison Krauss and The Cox Family, who collaborated on a grammy award winning album for Best Southern Gospel Bluegrass Recording in 1996, and the Kingdom Heirs with Kirk Talley, who are regular performers at Dollywood. <br><br>The song selection is a heavenly mix of traditional gospel standards, &quot;When The Role Is Called Up Yonder&quot; and &quot;In The Sweet By And By,&quot; and Parton originals &quot;Coat Of Many Colors&quot; and &quot;The Seeker.&quot; Through the songs the connection between gospel and country music is evident. <br><br>&quot;This music is first and foremost about friends and loved ones sharing something very special,&quot; Parton says. &quot;Families and groups of people come together, united by a common bond, a belief, a hope. It&#39;s no accident that our greatest performers grew up in this environment.&quot; <br><br>To preserve the history and heritage of gospel singing, Parton will open the new Southern Gospel Hall of Fame and Museum during Grand Opening Festivities at Dollywood April 16-18.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Entertainment Weekly</font><br><font size="2">July 16, 1999</font><br><br><b>Hello, Dollywood</b><br><font size="1"><b>Fourteen years ago, Dolly Parton unveiled plans for a theme park as grand and showy as the star herself.</b></font> </div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Entertainment Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Entertainment Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><blockquote>With her towering wigs, harlequin makeup, and, of course, always-accentuated twin trademarks, Dolly Parton has never been one for understatement. So when the country star decided to commemorate her downhome upbringing, you knew she wasn&#39;t just going to mount a plaque.<br><br></blockquote>Still, even Parton&#39;s faithful were surprised when she announced, on July 22, 1985, plans for a theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., to be called, what else?, Dollywood. <br><br>The planned park was ambitious in scope. Country stars had long been known for plastering their names on self-aggrandizing museums or restaurants (Johnny&#39;s House of Cash and Twitty City, both in Nashville, to name but two). But Dollywood, which officially opened for business the following May, was on a whole different scale. Spread over 400 acres, Dollywood&#39;s attractions included a museum featuring her handwritten lyric sheets and childhood corncob dolls; a restaurant called Aunt Granny&#39;s Dixie Fixins, after her nieces and nephews&#39; nickname for her; and a replica of the log cabin in which Parton and her 11 siblings grew up. For added authenticity, Dolly employed real Partons: Members of her family staged a musical revue, and her mother and oldest sister decorated the reproduced cabin (built by Parton&#39;s brother). <br><br>Though cynics wondered how much interest there&#39;d be in such a one-note enterprise, Parton confidently sank $6 million of her own money into the park&#39;s construction. &quot;My family was supportive and thought it was a great idea,&quot; says Parton, 53. &quot;But my accountants, they thought it was a very bad idea.&quot; They needn&#39;t have worried. Tourists flocked to the hokey-but-homey extravaganza. In its first season, Dollywood attracted 1.3 million visitors. Through the years, a number of popular features were added, including a bald eagle sanctuary, a radio station, and the $8 million Tennessee Tornado roller coaster. This year, attendance will hit 2.2 million, and by one estimate, Dollywood pulls in over $30 million a year in profits. <br><br>Yet its success has irked some Nashville purists. With country music enjoying more mainstream exposure, many are unhappy to see the crass flaunting of Dollywood&#39;s backwoods charm. &quot;The industry is torn between its hoedown Southern roots and its L.A. and New York sophistication,&quot; says country historian Bruce Feiler. <br><br>None of that fazes Parton, who&#39;s taken the park&#39;s success as a charge to set her sights even higher. While efforts to erect a park in Japan fell through, she still hopes for EuroDollywood...and beyond. &quot;You know how big I dream,&quot; she says. &quot;Today Pigeon Forge, tomorrow the world!&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">September 14, 1999</font><br><br><font size="1"><b>Dolly Takes Charge!<br>Dolly Parton moves full steam ahead with a powerful new TV movie and a full plate of other projects</b></font></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br>A curvy redhead knocks on the door of Billy Dean&#39;s bachelor pad. The door swings open and Billy locks eyes with the woman standing before him.  <br>He leads her inside. He moves closer, close enough to feel her breath. They linger for a moment . . . then sparks fly and they share a passionate kiss. <br> &quot;Cut!&quot;<br>Back to earth. The director&#39;s command reveals that it&#39;s only make-believe. The scene is taking place on the set of Dolly Parton&#39;s new movie, <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i>. And country&#39;s most famously platinum blonde has traded in her trademark tresses for an eye-catching red wig to play the role of a woman who follows her dream out of the Tennessee hills to the big city of Nashville. Long, tall singer/songwriter Billy Dean is cast as her band&#39;s guitarist, and Dolly&#39;s love interest.<br>&quot;We were so nervous and clumsy!&quot; Dolly says of her kissing scene, during a break. &quot;We were like little kids having our first date. Billy would say, &#39;Well, I&#39;m going to shave real good so I don&#39;t scratch you,&#39; and &#39;I&#39;m going to have a whole pocketful of Altoids and Tic Tacs.&#39;<br>&quot;I said, &#39;I will too.&#39; So the day we were going to shoot it, we were both chewing gum and mints like it was really going to matter. The craft services people kept bringing around pizza rolls and egg rolls. But we already had our mouths ready for this big kissing scene.&quot;<br>Dolly&#39;s husband of 33 years, Carl Dean, was a good sport about the onscreen smooch. &quot;Oh, my husband don&#39;t care,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#39;d been working on this movie for a few weeks and I&#39;ve been getting home late at night and leaving early the next morning. <br>&quot;Carl and I would just sort of pass by each other every day. So the morning of the love scene, I said, &#39;I&#39;m going to be kissing Billy Dean today.&#39; Carl said, &#39;Well, I&#39;m glad <i>somebody&#39;s</i> getting some!&#39;&quot; Dolly uncorks one of her trademark giggles. &quot;But he knows I&#39;m uneasy with doing those love scenes.&quot;<br>A solid camaraderie with her leading man made those uneasy scenes easier. &quot;Billy&#39;s just fantastic,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;He&#39;s so likeable. He&#39;s like a little brother, a <i>big</i> little brother. He&#39;s about 6&#39;4&quot;, and I&#39;m so little. Because he&#39;s so tall and I&#39;m so short, I thought, &#39;The director will have a fit trying to get the shots.&#39; It turned out to be great. The chemistry was also great.&quot;<br>Dolly is also hoping that her new movie has the right chemistry to connect with a wide television audience. The film, which will air Nov. 1 on Lifetime, is Dolly&#39;s most personal project yet. <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i> marks the highest degree of personal, hands-on involvement, from concept to completion, that she&#39;s ever attempted.<br>Dolly not only stars in the film, she&#39;s also the executive producer, and she wrote the song on which the storyline is based. She wrote all the additional music that appears throughout the film, and she was instrumental in choosing the arranger for the soundtrack. <br>&quot;I was very involved,&quot; she admits. &quot;And I promoted shooting the movie in Nashville from day one. I was thrilled that we could film it here.&quot;<br>Dolly also worked hard to find the right screenwriters to bring her original song to cinematic life. <br>&quot;I felt that it was very important to find Southern people to write this script,&quot; she explains. &quot;The writers we chose were both from the South, so they had an understanding of it.&quot;<br>Dolly certainly didn&#39;t become one of the world&#39;s most recognized superstars by letting someone else make all the decisions for her. She&#39;s not only one of country music&#39;s most creative, enduring talents, she&#39;s also a sharp-minded business-woman who truly enjoys rolling up her sleeves and getting down to brass tacks. <br>&quot;I&#39;ve always loved working on the business end of any of my projects,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s a lot of work, but I love doing that. I like feeling like I&#39;ve got my &#39;hands on.&#39; It&#39;s the same with Dollywood, or any of my projects. I kind of have to know what&#39;s happening.&quot;<br>She wrote the song &quot;Blue Valley Songbird&quot; three years ago, and it appeared on her 1998 album <i>Hungry Again</i>. <br>&quot;As soon as I wrote the song, I had full intentions of making a movie from it,&quot; she says. &quot;In my mind, I thought, &#39;This is like a screenplay.&#39;&quot;<br><i>Blue Valley Songbird</i> chronicles the life of a young girl who leaves home to escape her abusive father and aspires to become a star. While Dolly &mdash; like her character, struggled as a young singer, she stresses that the story is <i>not</i> autobiographical.<br>&quot;This is <i>not</i> a Dolly Parton story in any way,&quot; she says, curling up on a couch in her dressing room. &quot;I want to make sure that people know that. The character&#39;s father is nothing like my father.<br>&quot;My daddy only whipped our butts when we needed it, and not near enough,&quot; she adds with a laugh. &quot;But I <i>do</i> relate to the {character&#39;s} times on the road, the early days of trying to get started in the business, the traveling around, all the hard knocks and bangs of trying to get started as an artist. But no the childhood abuse.&quot;<br>Dolly returns to the set for scenes to be shot at a local theater. Her character, Leanna Taylor, steps into the spotlight onstage. Her red hair shines, her blue dress sparkles. The audience is on their feet even before the first note is heard. Then Dolly launches into &quot;Blue Valley Songbird.&quot;<br>Between takes, she delights in joking with the extras who are acting as the audience.<br>&quot;What do you think about this red hair?&quot; she asks. &quot;I can&#39;t get used to it, but Reba&#39;s been wanting to borrow my wig! <br>&quot;We&#39;re not really singing,&quot; she admits. &quot;We&#39;re just lip-synching. That&#39;s Hollywood for &#39;faking it.&#39;&quot;<br>But there&#39;s no faking Dolly&#39;s enthusiasm for this movie. &quot;It&#39;s all about responsibility in this movie,&quot; she says. &quot;This woman is trying to come to terms with herself and with her past. She&#39;s trying to decide that she&#39;s only responsible for herself, not for her father, her past, or the demons of her childhood. And then all the bad choices she&#39;s made with men, she&#39;s based on what her father was like.&quot; <br><br>The director calls for yet another take and the long day of shooting gets longer. The extras get restless. But Dolly, always the entertainer, keeps their minds off the delays. <br>&quot;I want y&#39;all to know, I <i>am</i> wearing falsies,&quot; she cracks, pausing for comic effect. &quot;I didn&#39;t want you to think these were my <i>real</i> shoulder pads.&quot;<br>Dolly&#39;s schedule these days is padded, indeed, with activity. The day after <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i> wraps, she heads to the studio to complete her next project, a bluegrass album called <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>.<br>&quot;It&#39;s something I thought about doing years ago,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;But usually when you&#39;re with a major record label, they call gospel or bluegrass records &#39;specialty albums&#39; and you never know if they&#39;re going to sell or not. But I don&#39;t have a record label now, and I haven&#39;t even pursued one. So I&#39;m just going to do specialty albums now.&quot;<br><i>The Grass Is Blue</i> is clearly Dolly&#39;s specialty. The record, to be released in October, features bluegrass standards, with one exception &mdash; Dolly wrote the title track.&quot;I wrote a song so I&#39;d have a great title for the album,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;It&#39;s one of those songs that says the only way you can get through a situation is to make believe that the opposite is true.&quot; Dolly recited the lyrics: <br><br><div align="center"><i><b>The rivers flow backwards </b></i><br><i><b>and the valleys are high </b></i><br><i><b>The mountains are level </b></i><br><i><b>and my tears are dry </b></i><br><i><b>I&#39;m alright now, but I&#39;m over you </b></i><br><i><b>And the sky is green </b></i><br><i><b>and the grass is blue.</b></i>  </div><br>Dolly&#39;s getting a little help from her friends for <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>. &quot;Everybody&#39;s going to sing on this album,&quot; enthuses Dolly. &quot;Alison Krauss is going to sing a bunch of stuff, and probably Ricky Skaggs and Vince Gill, too. <br>&quot;Alison and Ricky are just like soul mates, as far as singing. When Ricky and I sing together, it&#39;s like we know where we&#39;re going before we even get there. And it&#39;s the same with me and Alison. We look at each other like, &#39;Wow, how did you know I was going to do that?&#39; That&#39;s soul mate singing. <br><br>&quot;And I&#39;d love to have Patty Loveless and Alison do harmonies with me on this old song I love called &#39;Cash on the Barrel Head.&#39; I&#39;ve personalized a lot of the songs, rewritten some of the lines and made them &#39;girl songs.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Dolly gives a rundown of her <i>other</i> projects in the works. One is starring in yet another cable movie for Lifetime called <i>Trouble In Jerusalem</i>. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s about the problems and culture shocks between a Southern, Christian girl and a Jewish guy from New York,&quot; says Dolly, who&#39;ll play the Southern belle. &quot;It&#39;s a comedy, but it&#39;s about how true love survives. It doesn&#39;t matter about religion or anything else.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s also working on a gospel-themed project for CBS called <i>Heavens to Betsy</i>. &quot;I&#39;ve been working on that story for years,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s a two-hour movie of the week, starring two black women and myself who have a group called Milk and Honey. There will be a lot of gospel music in that, so I&#39;ll probably do a gospel album based on that movie.&quot; <br><br>And, hold on to your hats, Dolly has a new dance single with none other than flamboyant British pop singer Boy George. <br> &quot;It&#39;s a fabulous song called &#39;Kisses Are Charity,&#39;&quot; she says. <br> &quot;And then I did six songs for a movie for Elton John&#39;s company. The first single off that album will be a new version of &#39;Jolene.&#39; The film is called <i>Women Talking Dirty</i>, but it&#39;s only slated for release in Britain.&quot; <br><br>Dolly smiles. &quot;I&#39;m busy,&quot; she says. &quot;And Dollywood, of course, is just doing fantastic. We have wonderful new things, including a whole new water park area adjacent to Dollywood. So I have more to do than I can get done &mdash; but I still love the music. And I&#39;ll always be doing that in one way or another.&quot; <br><br>But Dolly&#39;s music probably won&#39;t include, ironically, a country album any time soon. The tide of country&#39;s musical marketplace seems to have turned against her, she says. <br>&quot;If I thought I had a market for one, yeah I&#39;d do one,&quot; she admits. &quot;But right now, no, because I can&#39;t sell it. I haven&#39;t sold any country records in years. <br><br>&quot;When I really went all-out on the <i>Hungry Again</i> album, I tried to make that as country as I could get it. But there was no real interest in it. It got wonderful reviews, critical acclaim, but it didn&#39;t sell that much. But <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i> came out of that album, and now that&#39;s turned into a movie.&quot;  Dolly&#39;s schedule may be full, but she&#39;s never too busy to dream. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m just starting my career,&quot; she says. &quot;I still want to do some great feature films. I&#39;d love to win an Oscar someday.&quot; <br><br>One of Dolly&#39;s goals may come as a shock. &quot;I would love to have a great recording career, which I don&#39;t feel I&#39;ve ever had,&quot; she says earnestly. &quot;I&#39;ve had a lot of hit records, but I&#39;ve never had that string of hits where you&#39;re actually consistent with it.&quot; <br><br>And then, she&#39;s off and running with another string of ideas, projects and goals. <br>&quot;I still want to do a cosmetic line. I also have a desire to have a line of Southern foods, like &#39;Dolly&#39;s Dixie Fixin&#39;s.&#39; I want to do a lot of stuff for children, like children&#39;s songs and books. And I would love to do an early-morning children&#39;s program, where I could tape several episodes. <br><br>&quot;Lord, I have new dreams every day,&quot; she says, smiling. &quot;And I&#39;m going to see them come true if I live long enough. And if I don&#39;t, it won&#39;t be because I ain&#39;t workin&#39; at it!&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Parade</font><br><font size="2">October 10, 1999</font><br><br><font size="1"><b>Newly inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the unspoiled Dolly Parton still drives a camper but no longer stays at those &quot;down &amp; outer&quot; motels.</b></font></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Parade" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Parade" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton was talking about life on the road with her husband of more than 30 years, Carl Dean: &quot;We have a camper, and we slouch around and have fun. In 12 days, we put on 5200 miles. We pull off the road and have a picnic, but nights we stay in a hotel. You know what we call a &#39;down &amp; outer&#39;? A motel where you pull right up to the front door on the ground floor. We don&#39;t have to do that anymore, but I don&#39;t have to be a celebrity, just Carl&#39;s wife.

Was that a big deal? &quot;When they told me,&quot; she replied, &quot;my whole family was visiting, and I was so floored, I screamed at the top of my lungs, and everyone came running, and I started to cry, but I didn&#39;t want to screw up my makeup. I was jumping up and down. I think of myself as still young [she&#39;s 53]. I thought if I ever got in the Hall of Fame, I&#39;d be an old woman.&quot; <br><br>Her latest album, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>, comes out this month. &quot;I did bluegrass when I was a kid,&quot; she said, &quot;but never a complete album.&quot; How does bluegrass differ from country music? &quot;The instrumentation,&quot; she said. &quot;No electric, all acoustic and always an upright bass and no piano. Also the style, so pure. And bluegrass has some more fun things than country.&quot; At which Dolly broke into a chorus of &quot;Cash on the Barrelhead.&quot; How&#39;s that for a bonus for an interviewer? <br><br>Besides the new album, Dolly stars in the Lifetime TV movie <i>Blue Valley Songbird</i>, based on a song she wrote. &quot;It&#39;s not about me,&quot; Dolly said, &quot;but a 15-year-old girl who runs away from an abusive father. She has a lot of snakes in her hair [vindictive, like Medusa] but comes to realize you can&#39;t blame people for your own misery. I play a red-head, not at all like Dolly.&quot; <br><br>There&#39;s a theme park called Dollywood in her home region in Tennessee. How&#39;s that going? &quot;In business 14 years,&quot; Dolly said, &quot;and we draw 2 million people every summer. I joke that we drove Opryland out of business.&quot; <br><br>Dolly was talking up the beauty of her native Great Smoky Mountains. &quot;We even have a ski resort,&quot; she said. Does Dolly ski? &quot;Not unless you can get me skis with a 5-inch heel.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The Mountain Press</font><br><font size="2">November 19, 1999</font><br><br><b>Dollywood Announces Plans For $5 Million Attraction<br></b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="The Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Mountain Press" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton spent the day at her successful entertainment park, Dollywood, on Thursday and made several announcements about the park and her career. <br><br>On the top of the list of announcements was the opening of the Dreamland Forest scheduled for April of 2000, the 15th season for Dollywood. <br><br>&quot;I decided a couple of years ago that I wanted to put a huge, fun area for kids at Dollywood that would be like my &#39;Dreamland Forest&#39; from when I was a kid, including a giant tree house with games and activities and fun for kids and families to enjoy together and use their imaginations,&quot; said Parton. &quot;When I was a little kid, I especially loved tree houses, and, now, the sky&#39;s the limit for fun at my new Dollywood Dreamland Forest.&quot; <br><br>The $5 million project will accommodate as many as 1,000 children at any one time. The Dreamland Forest will offer about 15,000 square feet of playground heaven. <br><br>Parents can rest in comfort in the shade of trees on benches placed throughout the area. On the outskirts of the forest, gifts and food will be available with a nature theme. <br><br>The new attraction moves the total investment in Dollywood to $80 million since opening in 1986. <br><br>Parton also announced plans for a new $20 million water attraction next to the park to open in 2001, the first official year of the new millennium. <br><br>The new water park, which has not yet been named, will be Parton&#39;s second theme park in east Tennessee. Great Smoky Mountains National Park will inspire the design and layout of the water attraction. <br><br>&quot;We didn&#39;t know if we should call it Water World, and ask Kevin Costner to come down to help,&quot; said Parton, drawing a laugh from the crowd in attendance. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to create a whole new park where families and kids can experience more of the adventures that we found in the Smokies&#39; natural beauty and fun. <br><br>&quot;This is another dream come true for me, and I&#39;m already looking forward to being here to make a big splash when my water park opens around Memorial Day 2001.&quot; <br><br>The water park&#39;s key attractions will include a multiple person family raft ride through some natural appearing mountain terrain, a children&#39;s pool area, single- and double-tubed slides, a 25,000 square foot wave pool, and a &quot;Turbo Twister&quot; speed slide that simulates a mountain waterfall. <br><br>Other features of the new attraction will be food and beverage areas, an arcade, a bath house and benches under shade trees for those who want to cool off out of the sun. <br><br>According to Dollywood officials, an estimated 300,000 people will visit the water park in its first year of operation. The water park will be located on 35 acres adjacent to Dollywood. <br><br>While at Dollywood, Parton made another announcement about the expansion of her Imagination Library program, which provides a book each month to every preschool child in her original home area of Sevier County.<br><br>December will mark the fourth year of the program, and in the year 2000, the Imagination Library will expand throughout the country to any community that wishes to participate. <br>&quot;I just decided it was time to share this wonderful program with kids across the country,&quot; said Parton. &quot;Reading is such an important key to a child&#39;s imagination. <br><br>&quot;Many of the stories I tell in my music are a result of my imagination and dreams as a child growing up in the mountains. If the Imagination Library helps families experience the joy and wonder of their children&#39;s imagination, then it will be making one of my biggest dreams come true.&quot; <br><br>To participate in the program, communities will have to follow the outline of the program, which means every child in the participating community must receive one book each month from birth to the age of five. <br><br>Participating communities are responsible for the development of a funding source and must be detailed in a plan for submission. <br><br>It was announced that the city of Pratt, Kan., began their Imagination Library program a few months ago, involving more than 300 children. Also, some communities in Georgia, Missouri, South Carolina and Alabama have expressed interest in the program to be started next year. <br><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="The Mountain Press" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Mountain Press" width="455"><br><div align="left"><br><div align="center"><b>Parton staying active</b><br><br><div align="left">Dolly Parton could certainly be excused if she decided to slow down a bit. <br><br>But despite the success Parton has experienced over the past 30 years, which includes hit records, movies, television shows, theme parks, a line of wigs, being named one of America&#39;s Sexiest People Over 50 by Modern Maturity magazine and being the 63rd inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame, she has no plans to hit the brakes in the future. <br><br>Although she has not really found the Fountain of Youth, she said Thursday while at Dollywood that she &quot;never plans on growing up. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got more exciting projects in the works now than at any time in my career,&quot; she said. &quot;And, almost all of these new projects revolve around kids. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve wrapped up this century with an original movie on the Lifetime channel, my first ever bluegrass album and being honored by the Country Music Hall of Fame, a great honor for which I&#39;m very grateful. But I feel like I&#39;ve found the Fountain of Youth to start the next century by being busier than ever with a multitude of new projects.&quot; <br><br>Besides the new plans for additions to Dollywood and a new water theme park, Parton has hopes to get involved with television and audio entertainment directed specifically at children. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m hoping to be involved in a really unique children&#39;s television show,&quot; she said. &quot;As well as several other kid-centered videos, books and music projects. <br>&quot;I&#39;ve always been a dreamer, so I wouldn&#39;t describe this as a predetermined plan. It&#39;s almost inspiration that just feels right. I feel like a kid in a candy store, and everybody knows I&#39;ve got a big sweet tooth.&quot;</div></div></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Knoxville News-Sentinel</font><br><font size="2">November 19, 1999</font><br><br><b>Dolly Makes A Splash</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="The Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"></div><br><br>PIGEON FORGE, Dolly Parton is dipping her toe into another amusement enterprise here, a $20 million water park opening Memorial Day weekend of 2001. <br><br>The yet-unnamed, 35-acre water park, which will be about four miles from the Dollywood theme park off Middle Creek Road, will feature single- and double-tube slides; a multiple-person rafting ride; a children&#39;s pool area; and a 25,000-square-foot wave pool. <br><br>Though the water park is a separate business from Dollywood, it is a joint venture by the Dollywood Co., the partnership of Parton and the Herschend Family of Branson, Mo. The company also owns Dixie Stampede and had owned Music Mansion music theater, both in Pigeon Forge. <br><br>Nearly 250 seasonal jobs will be created by the water park, says Barbara Joines, assistant general manager at Dollywood. <br><br>The Herschends also own Whitewater Adventure water park in Branson. <br>Dollywood officials did not comment on how much revenue would be generated from the new water park annually, but $20 million will be invested into the project over its first five years. <br><br>Close to 300,000 guests are projected to visit the water park in its first season, which will run from May until September. Parton said Thursday she envisions the water park developing indoor components eventually. <br><br>&quot;We feel like we need something like this to entertain all the guest coming here,&quot; Parton said. &quot;It needs to be something separate from Dollywood so folks don&#39;t have to come to both (Dollywood and the water park).&quot; <br><br>Dollywood, now in its 14th season, draws more than 2.3 million visitors a season, which extends from April through December. <br> Other announcements made Thursday: <br><br><ul><li>Dreamland Forest, a $5 million, interactive tree house play area, will debut next to the Craftsmen&#39;s Valley area when Dollywood reopens next spring. The area will hold close to 1,000 guests, will cover 15,000 square feet and will sit 50 feet above the ground. The area, supported by posts made to look like trees, will sport games, musical instruments and water blasters.</li></ul><ul><li>Imagination Library, a project giving free books to every preschooler in Sevier County, is expanding nationally. Parton&#39;s Dollywood Foundation will oversee the expansion but will not operate it in other communities. Already small towns in Kansas and Georgia are primed for their own Imagination Libraries, foundation officials said.</li></ul><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="The Knoxville News-Sentinel" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="The Knoxville News-Sentinel" width="455"><br><br><div align="center"><b>Parton wants Dollywood to be part of legacy</b><br><br><div align="left">PIGEON FORGE, Dolly Parton wants Dollywood to be as much part of her legacy as her music. <br><br>&quot;I have always looked at Dollywood as a cultural center for the Smoky Mountains,&quot; said the entertainer Thursday during an interview in her apartment at Dollywood. <br><br>&quot;I would not mind this being part of my legacy, maybe even the biggest part of it. I wouldn&#39;t mind if people remembered me for my music as well as (Dollywood) because I am very proud of this.&quot; <br><br>Parton says she had some doubts in the beginning when she agreed to be part of revamping Pigeon Forge&#39;s old Silver Dollar City theme park into Dollywood in 1986. <br><br>&quot;You are always apprehensive when you try to do something like this on such a big scale,&quot; she said. &quot;You think about the money and all the competition. I knew it was a chance to take, a big chance. But I knew if it worked that it would be really great.&quot; <br><br>Since 1986, Dollywood has more than doubled its annual attendance and has become Tennessee&#39;s most popular theme park. Parton, a Sevier County native, is credited with the massive growth of tourism in Pigeon Forge because of it. <br><br>Parton says she sees Dollywood becoming an independent destination with an expansion that would include lodging. <br><br>&quot;We have been involved in trying to get a hotel built at Dollywood since we opened,&quot; Parton said. <br><br>&quot;We almost have done it two or three times, but either the deal would fall through or we didn&#39;t feel right about the people involved in it. But absolutely, we are going to have a Dollywood hotel even if it is something I have to do on my own.&quot;</div></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Bluegrass Now</font><br><font size="2">December 1999</font><br><br><b>Dolly Goes Bluegrass</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Bluegrass Now" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Bluegrass Now" width="455"></div><br><br>She strides across the stage, microphone in hand, and takes her place at the center, the sequins on her blue dress flashing in the spotlights. The band&mdash;Barry Bales, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, Alison Krauss, Jim Mills, Bryan Sutton and Chris Thile, launches into a hard-driving bluegrass beat and Dolly Parton is off and running, debuting a selection from her new bluegrass album, <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>, before a television audience of millions at the Country Music Association&#39;s annual awards show, where she has just been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. <br><br>Parton has never been one to do things in a half-hearted fashion, and in &quot;going bluegrass&quot; she&#39;s made no exception. <i>The Grass Is Blue</i> is an astonishing collection, not only because of the world-class material and talent (Bales, Douglas, Duncan, Krauss, Mills, and Sutton as well as Sam Bush, Rhonda and Darrin Vincent, Dan Tymminski, Claire Lynch, Keith Little, Louis Nunley and Patty Loveless), but because of how it came to me. <br><br>&quot;I had never really given thought to doing a full bluegrass album,&quot; she says, &quot;I guess it had passed through my mind lightly, but I&#39;d never really said, &#39;Well, I&#39;m going to do it.&#39; The way this album came about, Steve Buckingham, who produced so many of my albums, and I had dinner one night when we were both in Los Angeles for business, and he told me about a survey of some sort in which people were asked who they would most like to hear do a bluegrass album. &#39;And do you know what the results were?&#39; he said. &#39;Dolly Parton, ten to one, people wanted to hear Dolly Parton do a bluegrass album.&#39; I said, &#39;Well, let&#39;s just do one.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Though she hadn&#39;t seriously considered the idea before, it&#39;s not really a surprising one. Despite the immense success she&#39;s had in pop music and in Hollywood, Parton&#39;s roots in the Tennessee hills still lie close to the surface, and bluegrass music has run like a thread through her career from her 1950s childhood appearances to her first solo Top 10 hit, &quot;Muleskinner Blues&quot;, &quot;Bill Monroe loved it,&quot; she says. &quot;He used to invite me out to sing it with him when we were on the same shows&quot;, to her use of Bob and Sonny Osborne&#39;s harmonies on her <i>9 To 5 and Odd Jobs</i> album to 1994&#39;s <i>Heartsongs</i>, which featured many of bluegrass&#39;s top artists. <br><br>As a child, I was always around music, and all of my people played fiddles, mandolins, banjos and guitars. So every kid in every family was used to having those just laying around. I was especially in love with the sound of the banjo, and I had an uncle who played it, and there was an old man who lived up the road&mdash;I wrote the song &quot;Applejack&quot; about him, who showed me how to play. And actually, if I don&#39;t have these artificial fingernails on, I can play the banjo, that old clawhammer style. When I was little, I could really get a move on it. <br><br>&quot;We pretty much defined our music as just mountain music,&quot; she continued, &quot;but when I started singing on radio and television in Knoxville, they had bluegrass people like Jim &amp; Jesse and the Brewster Brothers on there, and they sang those bluegrass, high lonesome harmonies. So I was always around it, and I always knew the difference, in that there was always a definite thing in the groups that considered themselves bluegrass, there was a purity to it. The bluegrass harmonies are just so different from the country ones, unless you&#39;ve grown up with them both.&quot; <br><br>Still, it wasn&#39;t this year, when she parted ways with her most recent major label, that Parton felt she really had the freedom to pursue inspirations like Buckingham&#39;s proposal. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not tied up to a record label, I don&#39;t have to do anything, I don&#39;t have to try to be commercial or please a record label or radio,&quot; Parton explained. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to write to please anybody but myself. I could find a label, but I don&#39;t want to; now I can do things project by project. I can do this bluegrass album, and I hope to do more of them, and I can do a project with Boy George and Culture Club, too. This is freedom, and I&#39;ve lived long enough to earn it, and I guess deserve it, and I&#39;m going to claim it whether I deserve it or not,&quot; she laughs. <br><br><i>The Grass Is Blue</i>, she calls it &quot;the purest thing that I&#39;ve ever done, truly inspired, makes good use of that freedom, and it may be part of what accounts for how rapidly it moved from idea to finished product. <br><br>&quot;This was a charmed and blessed project, almost a spiritual experience for me,&quot; she explained. &quot;The musicians that Steve put together are the very best of the best, and they had such a great respect for each other. When I would go to the studio during the day and hear them play, it was like going to the world&#39;s greatest concert. I would get emotional just from hearing them on the headphones. It moved my soul. We were all getting off on this thing. It was just magical, like going on a spiritual journey with this music.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It was fun,&quot; guitarist Bryan Sutton agrees. &quot;It was a magical kind of thing. There are artists you run across every once in a while where as soon as they open their mouths to sing the song is there, there&#39;s no question about what ought to be there, what ought not to be there. We did the whole record in two days. Everything was pretty much live.&quot; <br><br>In fact, Parton says, many of the vocals on the finished product were sung with the musicians as they recorded. Frequently, even in bluegrass, these &quot;scratch&quot; vocal tracks are replaced later, but between Parton&#39;s usual preference for early takes and the spirit that was in the room during the recording of <i>The Grass Is Blue</i>, the stage was set for an unusually spontaneous collection. <br><br>&quot;We had so many classic songs,&quot; said Parton, &quot;and I&#39;ve been singing them all my life, and, of course, the musicians have been playing them all their lives. And I sang them with such conviction and love and respect, because I knew the songs so well, and I would think of who had recorded them, and who had written them, and how I had heard them when I was a child. So all we had to do was just go into the studio and do it. I just sang from my heart.&quot; <br><br>A healthy portion of the album consists of songs familiar to many bluegrass fans, whether they originated in the style (&quot;I&#39;m Gonna Sleep With One Eye Open&quot;) or were brought into it from country by earlier bluegrass artists (&quot;I Wonder Where You Are Tonight,&quot; &quot;I Still Miss Someone&quot;), but there are songs from Parton, too (&quot;I wrote &#39;Steady As The Rain&#39; for my sister Stella, but I wrote it on the banjo, that&#39;s why it has that steady rolling sound&quot;), as well as a couple of left-field choices, including Blackfoot&#39;s &quot;Train, Train,&quot; the song she performed on the CMA Awards show. In the hands of Dolly Parton and her all-star friends, though, all of them are given a sound that is both unmistakably bluegrass and uniquely Parton&#39;s. Her voice is, after all, one of the most recognizable in any field of music, and it still carries the accents of her Tennessee mountain home. <br><br>&quot;All I can do is sing my feelings,&quot; she says. &quot;I love bluegrass, I&#39;ve always loved it, and I always will love it. It just speaks to my soul.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Song</font><br><font size="2">January 1998</font><br><br><b>Dreams Do Come True</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Song" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Song" width="455"></div><br><br>People have told me that when Dolly Parton walks into a room, the whole room lights up. I have found this to be an accurate statement. It&#39;s media day at Dollywood (a theme park in Tennessee), and several TV crews are set up in the new DJ Platter&#39;s restaurant in the park to get a few minutes with this superstar. <br><br>She walks in and the laughs begin. With each interview she does, she jokes and the laughter and smiles trail. She gives one-liners as if she was schooled in the art of great comebacks. The usually calm and unaffected media acts a bit starstruck posing for pictures with Parton and some are even getting autographs for friends and family. <br><br>The only entertainer to boast her very own theme park is proud of the park. &quot;We actually do more business than Opryland&quot; (a Nashville theme park that is part of the Grand Ole Opry). Parton says &quot;We&#39;re outdrawing them in attendance, but we&#39;re not enemies, and we use a lot of the same people.&quot; <br><br>Actually, Dollywood is now the most visited theme park in Parton&#39;s home state of <br>Tennessee outdrawing not only Opryland, but Elvis Presley&#39;s Graceland as well. <br><br>Maybe the reason lies in Parton&#39;s being a big part of her park and getting involved with her people. Possibly a little too involved. Dollywood has teamed up with the kids network Nickelodeon this year and features a new show much like the &quot;U Pick Nick&quot; show on TV where kids get the honor of being slimed, which entails getting a green gel-like substance poured over your head. <br><br>While filming some commercials for the park recently, Parton got the honor a little unexpectedly. &quot;They were showing me what Nickelodeon was about, and they were showing me this and that,&quot; Parton laughs. &quot;I was watching this on the air, this kid getting slimed. I was watching the monitor, and they poured a bucket of slime on me.&quot; She continues: &quot;It&#39;s such a mess. I thought, no, I&#39;m a little too old for that, so I&#39;m not gonna get slimed, but I think I might slime somebody.&quot; The wig that she was wearing, she says, will be preserved and will later be displayed at the park.<br><br>In 1978, a Dolly Parton penned song includes the lyrics &quot;I knew that someday, in my own special way, I&#39;d repay all those <i>Nickels And Dimes</i>.&quot; <br><br>Parton is one entertainer who has come home to help her people. The same weekend the park opened, Parton learned that a local hospital was raising money to build a birthing unit, an addition to the hospital. <br><br>Employees had raised $80,000 of their own money. Parton quickly added $100,000 to their cause, and the birthing unit was named in her honor. <br><br>Her Dollywood foundation has raised over two million dollars to help schools and kids in her home county through concerts Parton has put on with celebrity guests like Reba McEntire, Burt Reynolds, and Billy Ray Cyrus just to name a few. In June, Parton took a day out of her busy schedule to read to a group of day care kids, as part of a reading program from Dollywood&#39;s Imagination Library that provides every pre-school child in her native Sevier County with a book every month from the time the child is born until the child reach kindergarten. <br><br>Then, Parton visited her park and spent time with her employees to show them her appreciation for their hard work. Every shop, ride and attraction at Dollywood displays a picture of the employees that work that certain attraction in a group posing with Parton. She does spend time with her people. <br><br>When asked about repaying those <i>Nickels And Dimes</i>, Parton speaks with humility: &quot;I don&#39;t think you ever can pay back completely or know really what you owe. It&#39;s just that if you&#39;re in a position to help, that you should, and I think that I&#39;ve been very blessed and I&#39;m very grateful. I&#39;ve so fortunate in the business, and this is a wonderful area.&quot; She continues &quot;I&#39;m very proud of my home; I&#39;m very proud of my people. So, I will always be doing it and [she ponders], I am paying back those <i>Nickels And Dimes</i>.&quot; <br><br>Her words and music have inspired many. Dolly says that her favorite song is <i>Coat Of Many Colors</i>, but also close to her heart is what she calls &quot;The song that bought me a lot of wigs&quot;, <i>I Will Always Love You</i>. You would have to live in a cave not to know about this song that Parton took to the top of the country charts twice and won a CMA award for. Whitney Houston, of course, took it to the top of the pop charts and garnered a Grammy. And let&#39;s not forget that Elvis wanted to record it in the mid-seventies. <br><br>The song was written when Parton broke off her business relation ship with Porter Wagoner in the early seventies. Those lyrics that touch so many and are so well known are actually her true life story. &quot;People are always saying they read my life story. I said no, you didn&#39;t, you read my book of my life and other unfinished business, and you read a lot of my life,&quot; Parton says, &quot;but my true life story is in all the songs that I&#39;ve written through the years, every song I&#39;ve ever written has some truth to something very near and dear to me.&quot; <br><br>Dolly&#39;s music has taken a bit of a change lately though. In March, Parton filmed a video for a dance mix of her version of Cat Stevens&#39; <i>Peace Train</i> that is featured on a new dance album. &quot;People love to dance to it, and I guess they&#39;re gonna show that video on VH1 or some of those stations [Dolly chuckles], but it&#39;s a little odd for me. You know, it&#39;s like, they took all the music away.&quot; Says Parton, &quot;it was the actual song that I did on the <i>Treasures</i> album, the last album I did.&quot; The video has another famous twist; it was directed by Madonna&#39;s brother Christopher Ciccone. <br><br>Whether it&#39;s dance, pop or country, Dolly Parton has made more than an impact on music and on many artists of today. Country&#39;s reigning queen Reba McEntire sang Parton&#39;s <i>Jolene</i> in her show for years and sights her as a big influence. Shania Twain told me once about an encounter with her musical hero in an airplane where Twain just couldn&#39;t muster up the guts to say something to Dolly. Holly Dunn told me about appearing at a Grand Ole Opry birthday celebration, having been placed next to Parton and being nervous just to be near her. And Patty Loveless tells author Lawrence Leamer in his new book that when she first came to Nashville, Porter Wagoner introduced her to Parton who took Loveless under her wing and taught her how to apply make-up and what to watch out for in the sometimes dangerous music business. <br><br>Loveless said that Dolly, to her, was the model of what a country star should be. When told that many artists today sight her as their musical inspiration, Parton lights up, then says almost in disbelief, &quot;Really?!&quot; <br><br>Then in true Parton style she jokes: &quot;I have to say it makes you want to feel quite old, [laughing] but it&#39;s nice and a wonderful compliment when I see articles and things where other artist&#39;s have said that they&#39;ve been inspired by my music and the fact that I&#39;ve gone outside the music and done other things. A lot of them kinda ask my advice and my opinion, and I try to give them the best advice I can when asked for it.&quot; She continues, &quot;I just think that it&#39;s a nice compliment. It makes me feel good to know that my music has meant something to people and has stood on its own through the years.&quot; <br><br>Whether it&#39;s Dolly Parton, the theme park namesake, the songwriter, the author, the movie star, the performer, the comedian, the humanitarian, or the business woman, still she dreams. &quot;I wake up with a new dream every day. I have the desire to make Dollywood even bigger and better. I have the hope of writing better songs and having some more hit records. I&#39;m working on some television shows now. <br><br>&quot;I want to do a children&#39;s album and some children&#39;s show on TV.&quot; Says Parton matter of factly &quot;Tomorrow I&#39;ll have new ones. I enjoy seeing my dreams come true. I have a lot of wonderful people helping me out, so I can&#39;t take credit for all these dreams, &#39;cause they&#39;ve really made it a dream.&quot; Well said for a dreamer who has made her dreams a reality and never misses an opportunity to tell others that they can too.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly </font><br><font size="2">July 28, 1998</font><br><br><b>Doll&#39;s hungry for her musical roots</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br>When Dolly Parton decided to record her new album, <i>Hungry Again</i>, she went back to the basics, her Tennessee mountain home. <br><br>&quot;This wasn&#39;t something that I needed to do for money,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;This was something I needed to do for <i>me</i>. It was my music that started it all. It&#39;s what means the most to me.&quot; <br><br>But when she went back home to write, she took the album&#39;s title literally, Dolly fasted for three weeks in preparation. <br><br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t all that different for me,&quot; she says, slipping off her trademark stilettos and curling up in a chair in her Nashville office. &quot;I have fasted off and on all my life, for spiritual reasons and to lose weight when I&#39;ve been heavier. <br><br>&quot;So that part was not that hard. I fasted for three weeks. I did a juice-and-fruit fast for the first week, to get myself into it. On the second week, I had nothing but water. Then the third week, I had juices again. <br><br>&quot;I just needed to know what I needed to be doing. Not just about my music, but also about my life, what I had accomplished at my age, what I wanted to do. It was lonely, but it was sweet.&quot; <br><br>Dolly says all of the songs on<i> Hungry Again</i>, to be released on August 25, are autobiographical, but only to a point. <br><br>&quot;Everything in this album is bits and pieces of me,&quot; she says. &quot;I take the liberty to make it a better story. <i>Every</i> song I write has something to do with what I or someone close to me has lived, felt, seen or done. When the ideas come and I sit down with that guitar, I don&#39;t question what I&#39;m writing about. I just write it.&quot; <br><br>Dolly points to &quot;Blue Valley Songbird,&quot; a story about a young singer/songwriter who leaves a troubled homelife to follow her dreams. <br><br>&quot;With this song, everybody wants to believe that this is my true story, that I ran away from home and my father molested me. That&#39;s not true. My father was a good daddy. But I know a lot of people who have been molested. <br>&quot;So I took things that were a part of other people&#39;s lives and put them with parts of my life. &#39;Blue Valley Songbird&#39; is about a girl from Tennessee. I made her up, but she had so many pieces of me.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Hungry Again&quot; was the first song written for the album. <br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know that I was going to call the album that,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;It wasn&#39;t until I was after I was over the headaches of fasting and kind of settled into the fact that I wasn&#39;t going to beating. <br><br>&quot;Then it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re high, like you&#39;re on a drug of some kind. I woke up at three o&#39;clock in the morning and couldn&#39;t sleep. I sat down, started singing and it all started coming: <br> <i>The thrill of desire, the excitement is gone <br> Let&#39;s love like we&#39;re hungry again</i> <br> &quot;I went home thinking, &#39;I want to write like I&#39;m hungry again and sing like I&#39;m hungry again. I want to live like I&#39;m hungry again.&#39; When this song came to me, I thought, &#39;How many people feel this way? You&#39;ve got a big fine home, all these great clothes, beautiful kids, a great job, and yet you&#39;re not good in bed anymore. There&#39;s no passion. There&#39;s no desire. You&#39;ve spent so much time trying to make it.&#39; <br><br>&quot;I could relate to that to many degrees with everybody I know in business who&#39;s been so busy working. They haven&#39;t taken the time to be passionate or affectionate or gentle and kind.&quot; <br><br>The first single, &quot;Why Don&#39;t More Women Sing Honky Tonk Songs,&quot; is vintage Dolly. <br>&quot;We picked &#39;Honky Tonk Songs&#39; because everybody thought it was so commercial,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;They thought it would be like a woman&#39;s anthem. I only wrote it because I thought, &#39;Why <i>don&#39;t</i> women write and sing more honky-tonk songs? Why don&#39;t people write more songs about women who are hurt and busted open? Are they not allowed to go down to the bar and have a few beers to forget it? But it&#39;s fine for a man to do it?&#39; <br>&quot;I love that song because I get to bring Hank and George Jones and Haggard into it with the lyrics. I&#39;m trying to tie the old in with the new. I had fun doing it.&quot;<br><br>Dolly also had fun shooting the video for the song at Robert&#39;s Western Wear, a bar and boot store in downtown Nashville. In the clip, Dolly has been left for a girl half her age and she catches her ex with his new love in a bar. <br>&quot;I wanted a young girl, not just a guy, in the video,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I wanted to show how pretty she was so you could understand why he would leave me &mdash; and so you could understand why I&#39;d slap him, because there was no way I wan getting him back. So I said, &#39;Get somebody beautiful.&#39;&quot;<br>The storyline called for Dolly to slap the actor playing her ex, to the delight of onlookers. But she didn&#39;t <i>really</i> slap him.&quot;It was awkward, really,&quot; she admits. &quot;I pretended that I was going to slap him. I said, &#39;I don&#39;t want to slap him. I&#39;m going to be criticized for being in a bar, for there being alcohol there.&#39;<br>&quot;Then if I hit a guy, too, it&#39;s like, &#39;There goes Dollywood.&#39; So I said, &#39;Let&#39;s just pretend I&#39;m going to slap him and then I&#39;ll pinch his cheek.&#39;&quot;<br>Dolly recorded <i>Hungry Again</i> in a back-to-basics manner, in the basement studio of her first cousin, Richie Owens.<br>&quot;I used to babysit Richie,&quot; Dolly remembers. &quot;Richie&#39;s daddy used to run my publishing company, so he cut his teeth on my songs. I had never worked with Richie musically, but I knew he was the one. I thought I&#39;d keep it in the family, keep it close and where it&#39;s understood.&quot;<br>Recording in the basement was quite different than a high-tech Nashville studio. <br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t as slick,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;It wasn&#39;t as &#39;professional.&#39; Richie&#39;s a great engineer and he has decent equipment, but it&#39;s still just an old basement studio. Richie&#39;s three kids were running around upstairs banging around and dropping things.<br>&quot;Everything that was happening was so real to me. We didn&#39;t holler upstairs and say, &#39;Everybody shut up! We&#39;re fixing to cut down here.&#39; I said, &#39;Let everything that happens, happen.&#39;<br>&quot;Richie said, &#39;Maybe we should go to a studio.&#39; I said, &#39;No, I don&#39;t want to. I want us to do it here. I want to be here with your family, which is my family.&#39; It happened so naturally.<br>&quot;We didn&#39;t have to go through a bunch of people. I only had to work with Richie. He produced it with me and engineered it. He understand what I&#39;m saying. Like on &#39;The Camel&#39;s Heart,&#39; for instance. I wanted it to have a desert kind of sound that makes you think of camels. He knew what I meant and knew what needed to be done to get that sound. It was great. I love the album, in case you haven&#39;t picked up on that.&quot;<br>Dolly also loves her husband of 32 years, Carl Dean. Their secrets for a happy marriage?<br>&quot;I think it&#39;s the fact that we&#39;re not in the same business,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#39;re not competitive in any way. He&#39;s got his world and I&#39;ve got mine, and together we&#39;ve got our world. We&#39;re good friends, we&#39;re very understanding and sensitive.<br>&quot;We don&#39;t argue because we don&#39;t like harsh words. It takes us both too long to get over something. The worst we say is, &#39;Oh, why don&#39;t you kiss my butt&#39; or &#39;Why don&#39;t you go somewhere for a little while.&#39; And the other one usually won&#39;t say anything back at that time.&quot;<br>Dolly and Carl prefer the simple life. <br>&quot;We&#39;ve always had a camper, and it&#39;s set up inside with a little generator,&quot; she says. &quot;We like going out to our lake house and sitting on the porch. We go out on the boat a lot. We&#39;re big on picnics. We love traveling. We love finding old abandoned farms and houses. That&#39;s one of my favorite things to do. <br>&quot;We&#39;re not the kind to hop on a plane and go to Baja or Hawaii.&quot; <br><br>Dolly, singer/songwriter/actress/author, has just one goal for the future. <br>&quot;I want to be doing the same thing, just more of it!&quot; she says. &quot;I want to be writing and singing and making records. I want to be doing television specials. I want Dollywood to be amazing.<br>&quot;I&#39;m still looking for a great TV series. And I&#39;d like to be doing some movies, Shirley MacLaine, when I&#39;m older. I&#39;m old enough now, but I&#39;m kind of in-between. I&#39;m a little too young to do the old parts and a little too old to do the young parts.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do an album with Chet Atkins, just him playing and me singing. I want to do a duet album with Alison Krauss, like a Louvin Brothers kind of thing. I&#39;d like to do more things like I did with Tammy and Loretta, or Emmylou and Linda.&quot;<br>In fact, you <i>can</i> expect a follow-up to Dolly&#39;s trio album with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. &quot;We did it four years ago, but we never did put it out because of some scheduling problems we had at the time. But it&#39;s finally coming out, probably in the spring of next year.&quot; <br><br>Dolly reminisces about the special times she shared with country legends who are gone, such as Tammy Wynette. <br>&quot;I remember many things about Tammy because we were girlfriends,&quot; she says. &quot;Tammy and I were always swapping makeup and perfumes. When she was in the hospital, she would always send for me because she wore a lot of makeup like me. She&#39;d want me to come see her and kind of paint her up a little bit. <br><br>&quot;Roy Acuff was like a daddy to me. He was to so many people. When I first came to Nashville, many times he would hand me money out of his pocket and say, &#39;Here, young&#39;un, you probably haven&#39;t eaten good today.&#39; He felt very protective of me, like he needed help. <br><br>&quot;But you know, we can&#39;t all live forever. We lose them and then we treasure them. We make the most of the contributions that they&#39;ve left behind. So we never really lose them.&quot; <br><br>As for today&#39;s new singers, Dolly has a few favorites. &quot;I love the ones who especially love me!&quot; she says teasing. &quot;I love Alison Krauss&#39; voice, I guess because I relate to that voice. That&#39;s very much the way I sing. And I love Lee Ann Womack&#39;s singing. And of course I think LeAnn Rimes is just terrific. <br> &quot;I like real heartfelt singers.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">August 25, 1998</font><br><br><b>Hungry Again Album Review</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton&#39;s songs took her out of the Smoky Mountains and into our hearts. She wrote simple, poignant songs such as &quot;Coat Of Many Colors&quot; that she wove around our senses with her shimmery voice, the flutter of a mandolin and the curl of a fiddle. <br><br>With <i>Hungry Again</i>, co-produced by Dolly and her cousin Richie Owens, the legendary singer/songwriter takes us back again to the front porch of her old Tennessee home and makes us feel like kin as she mesmerizes us with 12 new homespun songs from her evocative pen. <br><br>In her haunting voice, Dolly croons the tale about ol&#39; Zeke rocking patiently on the front porch, watching the clouds for that band of angels he knows is coming in &quot;When Jesus Comes Calling For Me.&quot; She makes our hearts ache with compassion for the abused &quot;Blue Valley Songbird&quot; who seeks solace and release in her beloved music. And she spins a gossamer, dream-like feeling of hope around us with her true-life fairytale about a poor girl whose rich imagination enables her to dream and pretend and prepare for a place out there on &quot;Paradise Road.&quot; <br><br>Simple and poignant, heaped deliciously high with savory lore and deep-rooted feeling, <i>Hungry Again</i> is like going back home again to where the heart is.

She hasn&#39;t visited the top of the pop or country music charts, hasn&#39;t starred in any recent movies. As for TV, she spent years working on an idea for a series that never made it from the drawing board to the screen. <br><br>So how does she feel? <br>&quot;I&#39;ve never been more excited or felt more creative in my life,&quot; says the unflappable 52-year-old. &quot;I feel like I&#39;m just starting the second part of my life, and it&#39;s going to be even better than the first half.&quot; <br><br>The woman the world knows just as Dolly has fallen back on reliable allies: hard work, listening to her instincts, taking risks. And she launched this stage by going back to where it all started. A year ago, Parton retreated to the Appalachian cabin she was raised in and settled down for an extended stay. Holed up in what she calls &quot;my Tennessee mountain home,&quot; she &quot;fasted a little, prayed a little and did a whole lot of thinking.&quot; <br>&quot;I went there to figure out what I want to do now that I&#39;m at a turning point. That&#39;s when the songs started coming.&quot; <br><br>She hadn&#39;t gone back home intending to write songs, but that&#39;s what happened. Over three months, she finished 37 of them. <br>&quot;Once they started rolling, I could not stop,&quot; she says, laughing in a high-pitched burst of exuberance. &quot;I&#39;ve always written songs, of course, but this reminded me of when I was young, when I wrote from morning to night. I just got going, and it seemed to get more and more intense as I went. Finally, it just built up to where I had a major climax. It felt so good I wanted to have a cigarette afterward.&quot; <br><br>Then, in a gutsy move, she recorded the songs with a rock band. The Nashville-based group, which recently changed its name from Shinola to Five Bucks, includes Parton&#39;s cousin Richie Owens, a longtime figure on the alternative-rock scene in Music City. Together, Parton and the band, whose members are all 15 to 25 years younger than she is, created <i>Hungry Again</i>, the Parton album out today. <br>&quot;I&#39;ve followed Richie&#39;s music all the way back through his new-wave stuff,&quot; Parton says. &quot;I&#39;ve been with him when he&#39;s had white hair, purple hair, black hair and green hair. He&#39;s always been a great musician. I&#39;ve worked with him on my demos for years, but this was the first time we went and did a whole record together.&quot; <br><br>The album crosses the earthy, mountain-based country music of Parton&#39;s earliest recordings with a raw, guitar-based sound that has more in common with &#39;90s alternative country than with mainstream Nashville. <br>&quot;The last album I did that was anything like this was My Tennessee Mountain Home,&quot; Parton says, referring to a 1973 album many consider one of her best. <br>&quot;That&#39;s probably the last album I did that was all written at the old home place, just like this album.&quot; <br><br><i>Hungry Again</i> finds Parton writing songs that carry themes and musical arrangements similar to those of such early hits as &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;Coat of Many Colors.&quot; <br><br>It&#39;s a style that many critics and many of Parton&#39;s oldest fans believe brings out the best in her songwriting and in her chirpy, expressive twang. <br>&quot;Because of everything else she is, people sometimes overlook how many great songs Dolly has written,&quot; songwriter Matraca Berg says. &quot;But she&#39;s an amazing songwriter, one of the best ever in country music, in my opinion.&quot; <br><br>Berg remembers sitting in front of the TV as a child, watching Parton. &quot;She&#39;s the first woman I saw who was singing songs she wrote,&quot; recalls Berg, the Country Music Association&#39;s 1997 Songwriter of the Year and author of such hits as &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; and &quot;You Can Feel Bad (If It Makes You Feel Better).&quot; &quot;I remember this unbelievable woman, playing guitar and looking beautiful and singing songs about where she was from and what she was feeling. It was very striking for a child like me.&quot; <br><br>Berg, like many of Parton&#39;s fans, believes Parton did her best work in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, when her songs were personal and her music put a modern spin on old-time mountain sounds. <br>&quot;I&#39;m real partial to those early songs,&quot; Berg says. &quot;To me, she was as important to that era of country songwriting as Kris Kristofferson. She really changed what could be said in a country song, especially for women.&quot; <br><br>Owens, who co-produced <i>Hungry Again</i> with Parton, also greatly admires his famous cousin&#39;s early work. <br>&quot;I was around her a lot growing up, and, in my mind, there&#39;s something real special about those songs she did back then,&quot; Owens says. &quot;I wanted her to do a Dolly Parton record that had the kind of mountain soul you hear on songs like &quot;God&#39;s Coloring Book&quot; and &quot;Coat of Many Colors.&quot; I think it&#39;s a fun record, but it&#39;s also a more earthy record.&quot; <br><br>Parton found <i>Hungry Again</i> refreshing to make, she says. Through the &#39;90s, she&#39;s struggled to put songs on the country music charts and to re-establish herself as a Nashville hitmaker, but she&#39;s been unsuccessful. <br><br>&quot;Radio doesn&#39;t seem interested in old folks like me,&quot; she says with a laugh. &quot;I think it&#39;s a shame they won&#39;t play records by people like George Jones and Merle Haggard anymore. I feel like I&#39;m doing the best work of my career right now. They say wisdom comes with age. Well, so does talent.&quot; <br><br>This time, she says, she didn&#39;t worry about shaping her music for radio; she just made the best album she could. <br><br>&quot;My music is what took me everywhere I&#39;ve been and everywhere I will go,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s my greatest gift and my greatest love. I can&#39;t abandon it. I&#39;ll always keep making records, even if I have to sell them through the mail or the Internet.&quot; <br><br>To that end, she recorded all 37 of the songs she wrote on that retreat with the young Nashville band. She has enough songs reserved to fill two more albums, she says, joking that she&#39;ll follow up <i>Hungry Again</i> with the successive titles Second Helpings and Now I&#39;m Full. <br><br>Music, of course, isn&#39;t Parton&#39;s only career concern. Asked what&#39;s happening on the acting front, she responds with a laugh, &quot;Not much!&quot; <br><br>But she&#39;s convinced that will change. Determined to star again in her own TV series, she&#39;s begun looking for a project to develop. She recently signed with the William Morris Agency to help restart her movie career. And she&#39;s started work on a script based on one of her new songs, &quot;Blue Valley Songbird,&quot; which tells of a young mountain woman who escapes an abusive father for a country music career. <br><br>And no, before anyone asks: It&#39;s not meant to be autobiographical. She&#39;d be the first to say if it were, just as she&#39;s eager to debunk a recent tabloid report that she and husband Carl Dean haven&#39;t been intimate in a decade or so. The tabloid picked up on a joke Dolly cracked at her album-release party. It&#39;s not true, her representatives say, and Parton and Dean, who&#39;s always kept out of the public eye, are distressed about it. <br><br>She&#39;s happier about Dollywood, her Smoky Mountains theme park; it&#39;s enjoyed its most successful summer season, despite months of stifling heat and threatening thunderstorms. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got a lot of ways to make money,&quot; the star says. &quot;But it&#39;s not about money for me. I really am hungry again. I want to do better at what I&#39;ve always done. I want to do more feature films, more TV specials, more movies of the week.&quot; <br><br>Then, with another explosion of laughter: &quot;I&#39;ve got big plans for the next half-century.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">The London Observer</font><br><font size="2">September 6, 1998</font><br><br><b><font size="1">Interview: Lonesome Cowgirl: Dolly Parton-She&#39;s the queen of country music, a Dollywood legend, America&#39;s Princess Di.

She was a wig, a quavering voice with a slight lisp, and a pair of huge, pumped-up breasts. She sang sad songs while wearing high heels and rhinestones. As a cultural force, she seemed to be at her most powerful as the innuendo in Ronnie Corbett&#39;s voice. She had a couple of hits in the 1970s. Later, she was in a few films; the fact that she was not bad came as a pleasant surprise. There was cosmetic surgery, weight gain and loss. An unspecific air of minor tragedy hung around her, as it inevitably hangs around those who have been celebrated for their body parts. In my mind, Dolly Parton was the American equivalent of Barbara Windsor. <br><br>But in Nashville, Tennessee, the home of country music, things are different. Dolly Parton is the biggest star country music has ever produced. She is the &quot;Queen of Country.&quot; Here, Dolly Parton is revered and loved; she is somewhere between Princess Diana and a female version of Elvis. One astonishing fact about her is that she has her own theme park, Dollywood. Spend a few moments thinking about that. There is a Dolly Parton museum. Tourists travel for miles to eat candyfloss and look at Dolly Parton&#39;s old stage outfits and the kitchen table she sat at when she was a child. <br><br>We meet at Parton&#39;s record company in Nashville. Her &quot;people&quot; are around, plus one or two heavies. There is talk of paparrazi outside the building. After our interview, we will attend an industry bash to mark the release of Parton&#39;s new album, <i>Hungry Again</i>. Following a period of artistic limbo, the album is a &quot;return to her roots,&quot; to the time before Parton was famous. She has recently said, &quot;It&#39;s almost like I&#39;m starting over.&quot; While writing the songs, I am told, Parton lived in a mountain retreat and fasted for three weeks. The songs, twanging and melancholic, might have been written 20 years ago, or 30. She started by wearing denim at home and rhinestones on stage; now she seems to be doing it the other way round. <br><br>She is sitting at a table, in an office, sticking rhinestones on several pairs of high-heeled shoes. It seems too good to be true. This is what somebody would be doing if they were sending Dolly Parton up in a comedy sketch. She shakes my hand, beaming powerfully. Her nails are long and red. She is wearing a wig in the shape of a shaggy bob. She does not look real. For a moment, I am zapped into an ontological crisis; I do not know if this is the real Dolly Parton or an actress playing the part of Dolly Parton, or if, in any case, the real Dolly Parton is an actress playing the part of Dolly Parton. Her lips look as if they have an extra dimension; there are inner bits and outer, permanently pouting bits. She has a tiny waist and huge, firm-looking breasts, the top halves of which are on display. The breasts look as if they are full of air, rather than plastic or jelly. They seem to hover between us, generating a force-field of their own. I will not mention them. I will wait for her to mention them. <br><br>I say, &quot;How are you?&quot; It is all I can manage. <br>She says, &quot;I&#39;m doing just fantastic at the moment. I&#39;ve been in Nashville, and I&#39;ve been writing a lot of songs, and I&#39;ve been working on a musical at Dollywood. I&#39;m feeling good and healthy and...ready to roll!&quot; <br><br>She certainly has presence. She projects. She wears a tiny cardigan, which she keeps pulling over her chest, and which keeps bursting open again. It stays in place for about five seconds. Then ping! Parton tells me that she likes doing interviews, &quot;&#39;Cause I enjoy meeting people, and even though you get basically the same questions, you can draw energy from it.&quot; <br> &quot;What are the questions?&quot; <br> &quot;What have you been doing lately? Are you and your husband still together? Yes we are, we&#39;ve been married 32 years this past May. [She is referring to the famously media-shy Carl.] And then people ask everything that you&#39;re gonna ask me today.&quot; <br><br>The fasting intrigues me. To re-enter the world of melancholic twanging, Parton starved herself for 21 days. She wrote songs such as &quot;Blue Valley Songbird,&quot; about a poor girl from the Smokey Mountains who is abused by her father. Others are called &quot;Time and Tears,&quot; &quot;The Salt in My Tears,&quot; and &quot;I Still Lost You,&quot; which are more or less self-explanatory. Like all country music, and like Parton herself, the songs are simultaneously painfully real and deeply artificial; it is a winning combination. <br><br>Sometimes, Parton talks about herself as a business rather than a person. She says, &quot;At this time in my life, I was trying to make decisions about what to do. I&#39;m 52 this year. It&#39;s hard to stay on top of country music, or any business, after you&#39;ve been at it for so long.&quot; The question was: movies or music? She chose music. She decided to recreate the conditions of her early success a small house in the mountains, being thin, hungry, remote. She wanted to feel like she did when she was &quot;Still hungry for money, or for stardom, or whatever, before I left home.&quot; She wanted to go back to the beginning of the Dolly Parton Myth. <br> She pulls her cardigan over her chest. <br> She says, &quot;I went back home and I thought, &#39;Well, I really need some answers,&#39; so I got up there and I fasted for three weeks.&quot; The cardigan pings back. &quot;After I got up there and started workin&#39; out things, I started getting inspired, as you will. The fasting state of mind, it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re on drugs or something, you get light-hearted and your spirit just comes. So I just started writing these songs. It came to me that I should write what comes out of my gut, out of my heart. And that was to write like I was hungry again, to sing like I was hungry again.&quot; <br><br>In America, and particularly here, in the poor South, the spiritual home of roadside burgers and deep-fried chicken, hunger plays an important mythological role. Here, where nobody need be hungry, people eat all the time, as if they were. Real hunger, of the kind that Parton sought out, is a rare achievement. It makes you think of old dirt farms, of thin people wearing denim, of the traditional background for the narratives of country music. Here, where fat people drive to fast-food outlets, the backdrop for country music seems to be disappearing. <br><br>Parton says, &quot;The hunger never stops, to me. I&#39;m a big hog. But it&#39;s about self-discipline. It&#39;s like, you&#39;re always hungry. I&#39;m always hungry. Anybody that loves to eat, loves to cook, you&#39;re always hungry.&quot; <br><br>Parton has had her problems with eating. For a while, depressed, she ate too much. Now she&#39;s over it. Having lapsed, she is a paragon of control. She says, &quot;I&#39;ve really had problems with it. I never was heavy when I was a girl. But when I got up in my thirties and started gaining weight, gaining weight, eatin&#39; a lot and gaining a lot of weight, I hated that, hated the way I looked. I tried every diet in the whole wide world.&quot; Now, she stays in control by eating small portions. &quot;I have six, seven meals a day, but I eat in snack portions. But I eat anything I want. <br> &quot;If I want ice-cream, I just eat a few bites of ice-cream. If I want pizza, I eat a piece of pizza, but I make it last a long time. If I want fried potatoes, I just don&#39;t eat the whole skillet. But I eat small meals, and my body seems to burn that.&quot; <br><br>She beams at me. She is never very far from laughter. She has a lot to say. Something, you realise, turned her from a pretty girl who wrote songs into this immense, cartoonish superstar, some hidden reservoir of need. She is spiritual, rather than religious. She grew up under the influence of heavy Bible-bashing. Her grandfather was a Baptist minister. God, she thinks, exists inside the individual. He is not &quot;some monster in the sky.&quot; She believes in reincarnation. Her face, after being lifted, looks more pointy and beaky than it did. Her eyes are big. She says, &quot;I love to eat. I love to eat. When I do come back as another person, maybe I&#39;ll be tall and have a tapeworm and won&#39;t gain any weight at all.&quot; <br><br>I ask Parton about country music in general. &quot;I think it&#39;s just ordinary stories of ordinary people, and if you&#39;re real good at it, you can tell &#39;em in an extraordinary way. Everybody feels exactly the same. <br> &quot;I don&#39;t care who y&#39;are, where y&#39;are, we all have heartaches; we all worry about our children, we all worry about our money, we all worry about our dogs, we all worry about our reputations. We all wear a sign across our chests saying, &#39;I am important.&#39;&quot; <br> I look at her. She fingers the inner hem of the cardigan. The breasts are in my direct eyeline. They probably look bigger than they are. Even so. I mumble, &quot;So...country music is about heartbreak, then?&quot; <br> &quot;No, no...&quot; <br> More mumbling. &quot;Or at least, that&#39;s how it&#39;s seen from the outside.&quot; <br> &quot;Well, there&#39;s a lot of it. But there&#39;s a lot of country songs that&#39;s just about going down to the club, the party, kick up your heels and work all week, and go down town on a Friday night. It&#39;s about everyday life. There&#39;s a lot of fun.&quot; <br> &quot;Can country music change with the times? Could country songs be about computers and mobile phones?&quot; <br> Parton laughs. &quot;I think they could be. But probably just as a passing line in the song.&quot; <br><br>The talk moves back to the new album. Parton is a deft self-promoter. She tells me her favourite song on the album is &quot;Blue Valley Songbird.&quot; She says, &quot;It talks about a girl who was abused by her father, certainly it was not a true story of mine, but because I&#39;m a storyteller I think up things like that.&quot; I look up, interested. Parton says, &quot;She&#39;s from the hills; I took her out of the mountains, I took her on the road, trying to make it as a star, and I thought, wow, this is such a good story, this should be movie of the week, which we are now developing.&quot; <br> Parton says, &quot;See, it could give me a chance...see, there could be a very young girl who plays the very young girl...&quot; <br><br>She tells me the story of the putative movie; the young girl, the abuse, the travels, the letters she sends back home, the cult following she develops, the fact that she never makes it as a star. This last theme is interesting, because Parton, who has made it as a star, finds her own life to be less than perfect as subject matter.<br><br>She says, &quot;It&#39;s a continuous story, which also could be like what Kenny Rogers did. He did &#39;The Gambler 1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, and &#39;3.&#39; So, &#39;Blue Valley Songbird,&#39; I might do a continuation of it. She&#39;s still on the road, still trying to make it; even as an older artist, she always tries to make it and she never does.&quot; <br><br>Impolitely, I do not ask Parton who she thinks might suit the role of the older &quot;Blue Valley Songbird,&quot; but say, &quot;Have you ever seen &#39;Heart Like a Wheel&#39;?&quot; Parton says, &quot;No.&quot; <br><br>She politely listens while I explain the plot of &quot;Heart Like a Wheel.&quot; (Tragic female racing driver tours the Deep South.) As soon as I&#39;ve finished, she brightens and says, &quot;Another one of my favourites from the album is &#39;Paradise Road,&#39; and I wrote that song because that&#39;s the name of the musical at Dollywood that we&#39;ve put together, which is kinda the story of my life.&quot; <br><br>Dollywood is in Pigeon Forge, at the foot of the Appalachian mountains, just a few miles from where Dolly Parton grew up. Her father was a tobacco farmer; he lived with his wife and, eventually, 12 children, in a small wooden house (Dolly was the fourth, a position from which, she told me, she had to struggle to get attention). The area has changed immeasurably since she was young and hungry; on the road from Knoxville, the nearest large town, there are now miles and miles of unbroken fast-food franchises. <br><br>I went past billboards advertising Dollywood. It was &#39;Splashtacular!&#39;; it was &#39;Entertaining!&#39;; it was &#39;Fascinating!&#39; There was a billboard advertising the Dolly Parton radio waveband, with a picture of Parton, grinning, and the line, &quot;turn me on.&quot; There were endless roadside attractions, mostly to do with food. Cracker barrel; Good Country Cookin; Home of the Hickory Hawg; The Muscle Car Museum. One place advertised &quot;45 types of breakfast.&quot; <br><br>I turned off the road and went past a crazy golf course with a rabbit theme. You can see the Dollywood fences a long time before you get to the entrance. It costs $30 for a day pass. People were milling around the entrance. Inside, it was crowded. The main theme is old-style country life, before Tennessee was taken over by burger joints. In Dollywood, burgers are served in old-looking themed buildings, the sort of thing you see in cartoons. <br><br>There are rides, quaint sideshows, a man who makes baseball bats. There is glass-blowing. There are shops. A themed train goes around, tooting. The replica of Dolly&#39;s child hood home is furnished with the actual furniture her family used. Inside are plain, arts-and-crafts-looking chairs, an old wooden table, an old-style quilt, iron pans. It looks like the sort of thing an ultra-trendy metropolitan student would go for. Here, people gawp at its plainness, its authenticity. It speaks of hunger, of denim. <br><br>In the Dolly Parton museum, there is a video of Dolly, to welcome you. She talks of the &quot;rich earth of the Smoky Mountains.&quot; She talks about dreams coming true. The air conditioning is fierce. There is a picture of a blonde, three-year-old kid. Her first microphone, a plaque tells us, was made from a tin can and a stick. An article from Women&#39;s World is headlined, &quot;Her First Microphone was a Stick and a Tin Can.&quot; You can see the myth at work. <br><br>The museum tells the story of Parton&#39;s life. There are the school yearbooks, in which she appears to be an attractive 40-year-old housewife, regardless of age. There are some knackered old boots which belonged to her father. Behind a glass case is Parton&#39;s childhood guitar, embossed with butterflies. <br><br>The dresses get more outrageous as you walk through the museum. We learn about how Parton left the Smoky Mountains for Nashville, wrote songs, appeared on the radio, and how she appeared regularly on Porter Wagoner&#39;s TV show. But why? What drove her? There is footage of Wagoner with his trademark ludicrous suits. Magazine covers are exhibited. The National Enquirer of 28 August, 1984, advertises &quot;Burton&#39;s Last Words&quot; (apparently &quot;Liz, Liz&quot;). Below Burton, larger, there is a story about Parton. <br><br>I went to Paradise Road, the musical about Parton&#39;s life. It starts off with the young Dolly saying to her mother, &quot;Oh Mama, I&#39;d rather sing than eat.&quot; (Something which was true, and then not true, and is, currently, true again.) <br><br>The young Parton is played by lots of people; half the cast, it seems, are there to show a facet of Dolly. In the story, God is the key to Dolly&#39;s drive towards stardom; one day, she finds God, and, deliriously happy, walking along, &quot;kicking up dust on that mountain road,&quot; in fact, a car pulls up. The man in the car asks Dolly, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; At this point, one feels a tinge of protective worry. Who is this man? What harm might he do? In the end, Dolly replies, &quot;I&#39;m going to Paradise,&quot; and the man, whoever he is, drives off. &quot;She not only found God,&quot; says the narrator&#39;s voice, &quot;she found Dolly Parton.&quot; <br><br>Parton herself appears in the show, on large video screens above the stage. At one point, having become famous, she is seen fielding questions from journalists. &quot;Why do you wear 5-inch heels?&quot; asks one. The reply is &quot;Because I can&#39;t find any six-inch heels.&quot; Another asks, &quot;What would you like people to say about you 100 years from now?&quot; She says, &quot;Isn&#39;t she good for her age?&quot; Why does she have such a small waist, and such small feet? &quot;Because things don&#39;t grow in the shade.&quot; <br><br>In the Dolly Parton myth, there is a seamless progression through adolescence. She moves from the God-fearing home in the Smoky Mountains to the Peroxide Dolly without scraping the gears. <br><br>In another theatre, a tall guy with long hair and a spangled waistcoat sings country-rock, accompanied by a shorter, pretty, blonde woman. These are Randy and Rachel Parton, two of Dolly&#39;s siblings. Between songs, Randy tells tales from the Parton family scrapbook: the house, the children, the poverty, the authenticity. His hair is a helmet in front and frizzes out at the sides. He is dressed as if for a Turkish Sultan&#39;s birthday party. The sister&#39;s voice is good; neither is she a bad songwriter. You wonder where she would be, if she had Dolly&#39;s drive. <br><br>It was dark. I wandered around Dollywood. People were still in the shops, spending &quot;Dolly Dollars,&quot; theme-park currency with Parton&#39;s head in the middle. The shops sell T-shirts and &quot;Dolly dolls&quot; and jam. You can put a penny in a slot and re-emboss it with a Dollywood symbol. I had some fast food in a 1950s-themed fast-food place. I had my picture taken for a themed postcard. <br><br>Why did Dolly Parton become Dolly Parton, superstar? Sitting in her record company office in Nashville, she says, &quot;Well, I was this child that had a dream...&quot; There is a pause. She says, &quot;I felt like not much attention was paid to me. So I found my attention. I actually found a friend in my guitar. I had a very active mind. I had an outgoing personality. I needed to be noticed. People said we&#39;ll take you down to the radio station. I was the kind of kid that the more attention I got, the more attention I needed, and I felt like I had a gift, and the more people told me that I was good, the more I believed them.&quot; <br> Parton talks about the effect of applause (&quot;I thought, wow, this is what I&#39;m gonna do for the rest of my life&quot;), and the need to be loved. She says that, as a child, she was needy for love. <br> I say, &quot;Is it the same for everybody, the need to be loved?&quot; <br> &quot;No. Well, they might have it. But I have an outlet to get it.&quot; <br><br>The change came at 15. She stopped being the sensible-looking high-school girl, and invented the Dolly look. She says, &quot;I was very fascinated with trashy-looking people, women with red nails and high heels and lipstick, to me that was beautiful, and yet in many ways that was against our religion. But I needed to be outgoing, so I needed to be colourful to look at.&quot; She imitated a local woman her parents knew as &quot;a tramp, a trollop. I would say she was pretty. My mother would say, &#39;She&#39;s a little tramp.&#39; And so, in my little mind, I would say that&#39;s what I wanted to be. I wanted to be a tramp.&quot; <br><br>One day, she bleached her hair. There was conflict. Her family &quot;just about had a heart attack.&quot; Her grandfather, &quot;thought the Devil had totally entered me. He said the Devil had made my hair like this. I said, no, the Devil didn&#39;t have much to do with it.&quot; <br><br>She tightens the cardigan. She is, she tells me, never satisfied with herself. &quot;I never write good enough, I&#39;m always trying to write better; I never sing good enough, I&#39;m always trying to sing better; I never look good enough, I&#39;m always trying to look better.&quot; The cardigan pings back. <br><br>She is honest about her cosmetic surgery. &quot;If you see something which is starting to sag and bag, and it&#39;s a very simple procedure, and if you&#39;ve got the money, why not go and have that little thing lifted up a little bit? Or those big things? To me, that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for.&quot; <br> I look straight ahead. She laughs. She has, finally, mentioned the breasts. <br> &quot;Um...how do you think people see you?&quot; She says, &quot;I know that I&#39;m kind of cartoonish. I know I&#39;m like a cartoon, which is fine. Mickey Mouse is a cartoon. He&#39;s lasted a long time. If I have any magic at all, it&#39;s because I look totally artificial, and I am totally unreal. So I think that people can sense that what&#39;s coming out of me is far more important than what&#39;s on the outside. The outside is fun for me, and I try to make it fun for them. I want to be your favourite dresser doll. If I looked as real as I am, I&#39;d be a plain old blank wall.&quot; <br><br>She gets up; it is the first time I have seen her standing. She is tiny. At the party, she wears her everyday clothes wig, tiny cardigan, high heels. There are pictures of her all around the room. In the pictures, she is wearing denim dungarees. Her show clothes. Somewhere deep in her psyche, the Dolly Parton myth is going into reverse.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country America</font><br><font size="2">November 1998</font><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country America" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country America" width="455"></div><br><br>She&#39;s a movie star and a businesswoman. She&#39;s got big hair and world-famous cleavage. She&#39;s tart, smart, outrageous and hilarious. And-oh, yeah!-she&#39;s also a singer and a songwriter, two things that have sometimes gotten lost in the shuffle of other pursuits and her oversize personality. But now Dolly Parton - the singing-and-songwriting Dolly Parton - is back with her finest, countriest album in years, <i>Hungry Again</i>.<br><br><br><b>Q.</b> How are you &quot;hungry again&quot;? <br><b>A.</b> I&#39;m still hungry to be acknowledged as a songwriter and singer, which is what my true gifts really are. It&#39;s my songs that got me out of the Smokey Mountains and took me everywhere I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;m just hungry to be a part of what&#39;s going on in country music, to be played on the radio, to be accepted and to be able to perform.<br><b>Q.</b> You were literally hungry making this album, weren&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t you fast for three weeks? <br><b>A.</b> Yes, but I&#39;ve fasted all my life. That wasn&#39;t new to me. I fast for spiritual reasons, but I&#39;ve also fasted to get the lard off my ass. So I&#39;ve fasted through the years. I never talk about it when I&#39;m doing it; you&#39;re not supposed to, according to Scripture. But I wasn&#39;t on any spiritual quest this time. I just wanted to clean my body out and anchor myself. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Are you a religious person? <br><b>A.</b> I&#39;m not religious, but I&#39;m extremely spiritual. God lives with me, and everything I do, I put Him first. I pray everyday. He&#39;s inside; that&#39;s where you go to find Him. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to fast any longer - I didn&#39;t want to starve Him out! He was probably getting as hungry as I was! I thought, &quot;Jesus, would You like a cheeseburger?&quot; <br><br><b>Q.</b> Size-wise, you&#39;ve been up and you&#39;ve been down. Are you at what you&#39;d consider to be your ideal weight right now? <br><b>A.</b> I&#39;m about five or six pounds more than I want to be. My husband thinks I&#39;m the perfect weight right now. He likes it that I&#39;ve got an ass, and he likes it that I&#39;ve got a little puffiness. That&#39;s just the kind of guy he is. But I&#39;d rather be five or six pounds overweight than five or six pounds underweight, like I was when I looked so scrawny. People thought I was anorexic or dying. It was funny, because hogs don&#39;t get anorexic. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Speaking of your husband, how is Carl Dean, paving contractor and one of the most famously reclusive celebrity spouses in Nashville? <br><b>A.</b> Carl&#39;s good. We just had our 32nd wedding anniversary. He&#39;s not the least bit interested in show business, and the stuff he does I know nothing about. But when we do get together, we have so much in common with the things we like to do, like camping and fishing.<br> <b>Q.</b> If someone bumped into you on a camping trip, would they know you were Dolly Parton? <br><b>A.</b> It depends. I like to put on a little makeup, even for Carl. I don&#39;t like to look my worst. If I&#39;m out in a car or a vehicle of any kind, I always think, &quot;We could get hit, we could get stopped, anything.&quot; I don&#39;t wear the big fancy hairdos and stuff. But if I&#39;m going out in public, I&#39;m going to look like Dolly Parton. I don&#39;t want people to go home and say, &quot;God, Dolly looked terrible.&quot; Now, they may think I look terrible [anyway], but at least they&#39;ll know I&#39;m <i>trying</i> to look like I do. They&#39;ll know I put some effort into looking that bad! To me, there&#39;s nothing more disappointing than seeing a celebrity out in public looking like dog poop. It&#39;s like, &quot;Go home and clean up.&quot; I&#39;d rather people say, &quot;I saw Dolly and she looked like Dolly&quot; than &quot;I saw Dolly and she looked like hell.&quot; <br><br><b>Q.</b> What&#39;s the most outrageously untrue story you&#39;ve ever read about yourself in the tabloids? <br><b>A.</b> I have to honestly say that most of the stuff they write has a little grain of truth. They&#39;ve told a lot of stuff about me that&#39;s true. They&#39;ve told a lot of stuff about me that ain&#39;t true. And I don&#39;t admit or deny any of it, because what I ain&#39;t done, I&#39;m capable of doing. <br><br><b>Q.</b> You were probably the first country female to use the word &quot;boobs&quot; on television. <br><b>A.</b> Oh, really? Well, what <i>are</i> they? Don&#39;t you call them boobs? Sounds better than &quot;titties.&quot; What do you get when you put Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Dolly Parton in the same room? Two boobs and a country singer. That&#39;s my favorite boob joke. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Was there ever a time when you didn&#39;t think your famous figure was so funny? Were you ever self-conscious about it? <br><b>A.</b> No. I was always happy to be a girl. I was proud when I started having boobs. I started pushing them up. I used to order things; I used to slip in and get these catalogs from different relatives, Frederick&#39;s of Hollywood stuff, and I&#39;d order push-up bras. I was 12 or 13. I was impressed with this trollop - or whore, or tramp, they called her - in our hometown. I didn&#39;t know, I just thought she was beautiful because she wore tight clothes and low necklines and red nail polish. My mama said, &quot;Oh, she&#39;s just an old tramp.&quot; I thought, &quot;That&#39;s what I want to be when I grow up, an old tramp.&quot; That&#39;s what I wanted to look like, because she was so beautiful to me. I&#39;m sure there are a lot of people out there who think I&#39;m a tramp because of the way I talk or the way I look. They think, &quot;If it looks like a tramp and talks like a tramp, it must be a tramp.&quot; But I&#39;ve said so many times that some of the girls I ran around with back home, the ones who looked so perfect and precise, good little Christian girls - they were screwing everybody in town, and I hadn&#39;t been with anybody. But I was the one the mothers didn&#39;t want their daughters to be around, because I was a &quot;bad influence.&quot; But I was never really a tramp. I just looked like one. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Let&#39;s talk songs. You really did have a &quot;Coat Of Many Colors.&quot; Do you still? <br><b>A.</b> Not the actual garment. But there is a little replica on display at the museum at Dollywood. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Was &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; really a goodbye song to Porter Wagoner when you wanted to break your professional ties to him and go solo? <br><b>A.</b> It was my way of trying to leave Porter. He would not hear of it. He could not talk to me reasonably. He would not accept it. I thought, &quot;How can I ever get it across to him what I&#39;m trying to do?&quot; So I thought, &quot;Well, you write songs, you&#39;re best at that.&quot; So I wrote that song, and oddly enough, that was the one thing that softened him to understand. I wrote that song in the early &#39;70s when Elvis was still alive. He loved it and wanted to record it, but he wanted half the publishing. I wouldn&#39;t give it to him. Everybody said I was a fool, I was an idiot. &quot;It&#39;s <i>Elvis Presly</i>, you <i>fool!</i>&quot; But then, when Whitney [Houston] did it [in 1992], I made millions from it, and I had a hundred percent of the publishing and a hundred percent of the writing. So I made every dime. It made me feel justified. I thought, &quot;Well <i>there</i>, Elvis.&quot; <br><br><b>Q.</b> Did you and Porter ever play practical jokes on each other? <br><b>A.</b> Not really, but a lot of funny things used to happen to us on that television show. One of the more embarrassing moments was with Mack MaGaha, the little fiddle player that was so spastic and hyper; he was a terrific showman, but he was just all over the place. That&#39;s when I was wearing hairpieces, before I started wearing full wigs. He was dancing around and I was doing my song, and he got his fiddle bow stuck underneath my little hairpiece and lifted it up. There was just enough hairspray to hold it to a few little hairs, so it just raised up and then came back down. Thank God it didn&#39;t come completely loose. <br><br><b>Q.</b> Who was &quot;Jolene&quot;? <br><b>A.</b> I tell a little story onstage for fun, so a lot of people believe it&#39;s about this girl my husband had an affair with - which he&#39;s never done, that I know of. But the story actually was, when I used to work with Porter, we used to sit on the stage after a show and sign autographs. One night this little redheaded girl with the prettiest eyes and the prettiest hair I had ever seen was looking up at me. She was maybe 10 or 12. I said, &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; She said, &quot;Jolene.&quot; I said, &quot;That&#39;s such a beautiful name and you are such a beautiful girl, one of these days I&#39;m going to write a song, and if you ever hear one on the radio called &#39;Jolene,&#39; you&#39;ll know I wrote it about you.&quot; Over the years, I thought maybe this girl would contact me to say, &quot;I was Jolene,&quot; but I&#39;ve never heard. <br><br><b>Q.</b> What&#39;s been your biggest stretch in a movie acting role? <br><b>A.</b> The only role I&#39;ve ever done that&#39;s really been out of character for me was my biggest one, Doralee in <i>9 to 5</i>. I play a secretary, which I&#39;ve never been. I can&#39;t even picture myself doing all the typing and the other things! But <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i>... I could picture myself being a madam. And then, when I was Truvy [in <i>Steel Magnolias</i>]...if I hadn&#39;t been a singer I would have definitely been a hairdresser. And <i>Rhinestone</i> [in which she played a country singer] was of course right down the alley for me.<br> <b>Q.</b> What&#39;s next on you plate? <br><b>A.</b> I hope to do more movies. I hope to do more television. But I would love to have a recording career. I want people to know how serious I still am about my music. Don&#39;t look at the boobs. Don&#39;t look at the hair. Don&#39;t look at Dollywood. My true love is my music, and I&#39;m starving to death for that to still be accepted. </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Music</font><br><font size="2">November/December 1998</font><br><br><b>5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1<br>Me And Dolly</b><br><br><div align="center"><b><font size="1">Our own Hazel Smith got to spend some time with Dolly Parton.

Seated at a conference table, Dolly counted, &quot;5-4-3-2-1, me and Hazel.&quot; We giggled and giggled all through our too-short allotted time.<br><br>Graduate cum laude from the school of hard knocks, the lady of many &quot;wigs&quot; is as honest and genuine as daybreak in the Smokies. She&#39;s not changed one iota. Course, Dolly&#39;s been there, done that...from the Smokies to the world...she&#39;s worth several million dollars...and she gives &quot;back&quot; all the time. She is country music&#39;s most successful female entertainer, probably the best-known country entertainer worldwide. In my opinion, Dolly Parton is the smartest person ever born in the State of Tennessee and Tennessee&#39;s best export. Come, look through the hillbilly spy glass.<br>Dolly&#39;s self-penned songs carry a message of hope, truth, faith and strength. She&#39;s not afraid to say she believes in the Heavenly Father, nor ashamed to admit she fasts and prays to receive spiritual guidance from Him. We&#39;re not talking religion here. We&#39;re talking spiritual. Naturally a witty person, if Dolly half tried, she could be a stand-up comic. Her red lips are always smiling or talking, keeping you on your toes. She&#39;s a velvet-tongued cynic who&#39;ll laugh at herself but would never poke fun at someone else. And she&#39;s a marketing dream that once slept nightly in a pee-soaked bed with five brothers and sisters right down the road from the amusement park that bears her name. Let&#39;s not forget the Number 2 washtub where 12 kids bathed in the same bath water, once a week, one at a time, on Saturday night, whether they needed it or not. She built Dollywood, providing employment for the entire Parton/Owens clan, which is half of Sevier County. Anybody who can sing or sweep got a gig. You can&#39;t do better than that for your family.<br>It all started with a song. Probably her song. But now, with her back against the wall, her mind tired of thinking and her heart o.d.&#39;d from the trappings of the West Coast, East Coast, Third Coast stardom, and her 30-year recording career in neutral, Dolly was holed in. She&#39;d been holed in before, and she knew in order to get out she had to resurrect herself. In order to get back to where she&#39;s know what was in the stars for her, Dolly knew she had to get hungry again. Thus, she had a possible song title.<br>She cut off her long signature nails, took all her favorite musical instruments, and retired to the cabin she&#39;d purchased outside Sevierville. Between there and her place on Center Hill Lake, she prayed and fasted, seeking spiritual guidance, knowing the Lord would reveal an answer. After all, this wasn&#39;t Dolly&#39;s first trip down on her knees. It was painful. Three months and 37 songs later, she emerged. Keeping it in the family, she got her first cousin, Richie Owens, to co-produce the project in his basement studio at his home. The results, <i>Hungry Again</i>, a CD of 12 songs with a semblance of &quot;early Dolly.&quot; God, is it good! As we talked, Dolly explained the &quot;birthing&quot; of each tune. It was a mother describing her 12 children and why each one was special to her. <br><br>Herewith a selection. &quot;Hungry Again&quot; &mdash; &quot;People have to work so hard to get where they are, and romance gets lost along the way. The thrill and excitement is gone. &#39;Let&#39;s love like we&#39;re hungry again&#39; is the hook line for the song,&quot; Dolly explained.<br>&quot;The Salt In My Tears&quot;, in her head and heart, Dolly knew &quot;The Salt In My Tears&quot; was a commercial song.<br>&quot;Honky Tonk Songs&quot;, While composing the songs for the album, the thought crossed her mind, &quot;Why don&#39;t more women sing honky tonk songs?&quot; Great song idea! Dolly thinks women should get to go out to the bars like the men where they can drink or get drunk if they want to and pick up somebody. &quot;Men do it. Why can&#39;t we?&quot; she allowed.<br>&quot;Blue Valley Songbird&quot;, Dolly says she is in this song; however, her daddy never abused her. &quot;Daddy didn&#39;t bust my ass half as much as he should have,&quot; she said with blue eyes twinkling. Dolly has plans to make &quot;Blue Valley Songbird&quot; into a TV movie.<br>&quot;I Wanna Go Back There&quot;, &quot;Can we?&quot; I asked. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could,&quot; remarked Dolly. &quot;Then again, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;d want to go back if we could,&quot; she added. &quot;Remember that old song, &#39;In The Good Old Day When Times Were Bad,&#39; that I wrote?&quot; I remembered. She quoted: &quot;No amount of money could pay me for all the memories I had back then/No amount of money could pay me to go back and live through it again.&quot;<br>&quot;When Jesus Comes Calling For Me&quot; reminds Dolly of both her granddads. &quot;You know I love old men,&quot; she said. She told me her Grandpa Parton would be plowing in the field, and he&#39;d say, &quot;When Jesus comes calling.&quot; &quot;He was always looking for Jesus,&quot; Dolly whispered and acknowledged she&#39;d long ago got this song idea.<br>&quot;I&#39;ll Never Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;It just came rolling out,&quot; Dolly said. &quot;What the song is saying is, if you ever want to try and make it right, you can. But I&#39;m never gonna forget you whether you make it right or you don&#39;t. I&#39;ll never say goodbye to you.&quot;<br>&quot;The Camel&#39;s Heart&quot;, The song&#39;s title has such a cute turn-around and is one of my favorites. I told Dolly as I listened to the song, I thought, &quot;Now that&#39;s Dolly wearing her silk underwear a-carrying her pistol.&quot; &quot;And I had it up there, too,&quot; she admitted. &quot;If my prayers don&#39;t protect me, my pistol would. I knew the Lord would understand,&quot; she offered... as we both fell over laughing our heads off.<br>&quot;Paradise Road&quot;, The story of Dolly&#39;s life is in this song, and it&#39;s used daily at Dollywood. When she&#39;s in town, she can step into the role as herself.<br>&quot;Shine On&quot;, This is the song Dolly sang at Tammy Wynette&#39;s funeral. She recorded it at her Grandpa Owen&#39;s church, with family and friends singing along with her on the chorus. Dolly told me that she and Tammy had started a song several years ago, and that night, after the funeral, Dolly finished it. She misses Tammy and feels bad that she&#39;d been so sick. &quot;But look what she left,&quot; said Dolly. &quot;What a legacy.&quot; <br><br>&quot;How are the folks back home?&quot; Fans like me want to know, so I asked. Her parents are fine. They had a little scare with her mama her a while back. Her mama used to dip snuff, but she quit and took up smoking. She had problems with her throat, and they were worried it might be cancer, but it wasn&#39;t. It scared her mama enough to quit smoking. <br><br>I mentioned it never bothered my that my relatives talk country, and I&#39;ve never tried to change the way I talk. Dolly said she felt the same about her relatives. She&#39;s never been ashamed of the way she talks or they talk. Sometimes she says she worries for them being so uncomfortable with TV or something. But &quot;it&#39;s like you said, Hazel, they&#39;re precious and sacred to me.&quot; <br><br>When she&#39;s in the area, Dolly attends the little church where her Grandpa Jake Owens used to preach. Nobody knows when she&#39;s coming, she just shows up. Everybody there is kin to her, and she can stay in touch with cousins and aunts and uncles and such that she doesn&#39;t otherwise get to see often. <br><br>The family matriarch with no kids, Dolly takes care of her family&#39;s &quot;needs,&quot; but says she can&#39;t take care of everybody&#39;s &quot;wants.&quot; She uses her own discretion as to what a kid wants, or somebody wants, if they should have it. Learning to say no to family was the hardest thing she ever had to do. But she learned. And, she says, she thanks God she&#39;s always been able to give what anybody needs. <br><br>In closing, Dolly said, &quot;I&#39;ve been very lucky. Very fortunate. Living life, you don&#39;t think about stuff, but turning 50, you do think of it. It&#39;s been amazing. What a blessing. What a joy. What a journey.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Music</font><br><font size="2">January/February 1997</font><br><br><b>Hello Dolly, Again</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Music" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Music" width="455"></div><br><br><div align="left">Times may have changed, but Dolly&rsquo;s still the same. Still larger than life, still self-effacing, and still a great country music singer. No matter how many entertainment worlds she may conquer, Dolly&rsquo;s singing and songwriting are her passion. Convincing radio to play her music, however, is another matter indeed.<br><br>  You want desperation? <br> We got desperation: &quot;I swear, Michael, I am desperate...&quot; <br> You want obsession? <br> We got obsession: &quot;I can&rsquo;t stop. That&rsquo;s what I mean, I&rsquo;m so serious...&quot; <br> You want angst? <br> We got angst: &quot;What can I do? Somebody tell me, I&rsquo;d be happy to do it if they&rsquo;d tell me what they wanted me to do...&quot; <br> You want truth? You want passion? You want talent? You want controversy? Heck, you want lust? <br> Hey, we got Dolly, and Dolly is always...Dolly.<br><br>&quot;You know the new country artists?&quot; Dolly is saying. She&rsquo;s wearing a miniskirt and a frighteningly low-cut top, leaning over the conference table and gesturing with her hands. Using a Herculean act of will, I keep my eyes focused rigidly on her blue eyes. &quot;Well, I think they&rsquo;re a pretty clean group. They&rsquo;re nice; they&rsquo;re courteous. I think they love the fans as much as us Old People...&quot;, she pointedly includes me in the &quot;Old People&quot; group, &quot;...You know how everybody used to go to Fan Fair and sit and sign autographs? Well, the new people do, too. So I have to honestly say they&rsquo;re not an arrogant bunch. And they&rsquo;re not a bunch of dopers. But it might be nice if one of them got drunk once in a while.&quot; <br> Dolly gestures theatrically, her hands in the air. <br> So there. <br> &quot;And, another thing...&quot;<br>The single greatest thing about Dolly Parton is that, no matter how far she might wander, she is incapable of being anyone but Dolly Parton. Smart, funny, disarmingly honest, as quick and as sharp as a razor, spectacularly talented, all packaged in this incredible Barbie doll body. She is one of the tiny handful of artists of any sort to reach single-name icon status and is, arguably, one of the most well-known American women in the world. Say &quot;Dolly&quot; just about anywhere the long tendrils of the media reach, and there&rsquo;s no question about who you&rsquo;re referring to. In a journey far more incredible than any television writers could have concocted, Dolly Parton has made her way from the Smoky Mountains into American Myth, with her honesty and her sense of humor intact. <br> So why can&rsquo;t she get her records played? <br> &quot;You want to know how frustrated I am, Michael?&quot; says Dolly, complete with hand gestures. &quot;You know what I did? I bought my hometown radio station, WFTV, and now the FM is WDLY. It&rsquo;s the smallest station in the world. Plus, I started my own label, Blue Eye Records. So, I said, I got my own label now, I got my own radio station. I can damn sure guarantee I&rsquo;m going to get some radio play, even if it&rsquo;s on my own station and on my own label. That&rsquo;s having to stretch pretty far, but at least they&rsquo;ll play me in my home town. How desperate can you get? I had to buy my own station and start my own label to get a record played.&quot;<br>Actually, this interview was supposed to be about Dolly&rsquo;s new album, <i>Treasures</i>, which is an eclectic collection of Dolly&rsquo;s favorite songs. <i>Treasures</i> is, in fact, a brilliant album that reflects Dolly&rsquo;s wide-ranging musical interests, from the hard country of &quot;Don&rsquo;t Let Me Cross Over&quot; to her fascination with pop (&quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot;) to the whacked 1960&rsquo;s mysticism of Neil Young&rsquo;s classic &quot;After The Goldrush.&quot; And, to be fair, Dolly always tries to stay on track. It&rsquo;s just that, well, Dolly is Dolly. <br> I tell her I like the record. <br> &quot;Oh, great, you like these songs because you&rsquo;re an old codger, too,&quot; she begins. &quot;We remember. That&#39;s one of the reasons I did this record, &#39;cause I knew the people like me and you remember these great songs, and they&#39;ll be brand new to them.&quot;<br>That&#39;s about as close as Dolly gets to Baseline Normal. She quickly drifts into a Dolly story (which have always seemed to me to come from a slightly alternative universe, maybe Dolly World, where everything was just a tiny bit... skewed). We&#39;re talking about Neil Young&#39;s &quot;After The Goldrush&quot; for instance...<br>&quot;I loved that song from the day I heard it on Neil&#39;s record. Then that girl <i>a cappella</i> group, Prelude, came out with it. And I loved it then, and I just remember thinking all of the things I thought it meant-the song was so visual. And I thought, &#39;What does that song mean?&#39; I just thought it meant everything...&quot; <br><br><blockquote><i>Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying <br>In the yellow haze of sun <br>There were children crying and colors flying <br>All around the chosen ones <br>All in a dream <br>All in a dream <br>The loading had begun <br>Flying Mother Nature&#39;s silver seed <br>To a new home in the sun...<br><br></i></blockquote>&quot;... And I thought, well, I&#39;ll interpret it like the Second Coming, or an invasion of the aliens, or whatever. And so when I took the song to the Trio project, me, Linda [Ronstadt] and Emmylou [Harris], and it was one of the songs... we all took our own suggestions and batch of songs. They both knew the song and had worked with Neil. So we did cut it, although that Trio album&#39;s never going to come out because it died on the vine. But we did cut the whole album, and then Linda put &quot;Goldrush&quot; in her album right after that, which didn&#39;t do anything. But I just still felt so strong about the song. And so, anyway, when we were doing the Trio album, I asked Linda and Emmy what it meant, and they didn&#39;t know. So we called Neil Young, and he didn&#39;t know. We asked him, flat out, what it meant, and he said, &#39;Hell, I don&#39;t know. I just wrote it. It just depends on what I was taking at the time. I guess every verse has something different I&#39;d taken.&#39; So when I did it, I thought, well, if Neil can&#39;t interpret it, then I&#39;m just going to make it my own. So in this version, I put it in the 21st century. When I said &#39;something about a king&#39; instead of &#39;something about a queen,&#39; I thought that could be Jesus and the Second Coming. And then, at the end, when I talk about the space people, I was thinking that the Mayans always said they&#39;d be coming back in 2011, so I thought, well, the 21st century, that&#39;s when something is going to happen. So I thought, well, I&#39;d put it over in the 21st century. I don&#39;t know. What do you think the song&#39;s about?&quot; <br><br>I confess that as much as I loved &quot;After The Goldrush,&quot; I&#39;d never even thought about the Mayans. <br><br>&quot;Well, I do,&quot; Dolly starts right back, &quot;because I&#39;m a writer, and I just kept trying to think about what Neil meant. I just loved the song. But when I first heard it, you know, when he says, &#39;I was lying in a burned-out basement,&#39; I just saw the Second World War. I just saw buildings and burned-out cities, I saw every kind of thing, and I thought, &#39;What does the song mean?&#39; I guess it was the acid.&quot; <br><br>In Dolly World, this is the equivalent of a &quot;yes&quot; answer. But in Dolly World, this isn&#39;t unusual, either. There&#39;s a rhythm to being around Dolly Parton, as if she has her own gravity field, no jokes here, which pulls you right out of your own orbit and into her larger-than-life world. Part of that gravity field is Dolly&#39;s <i>Southernness</i>, the sense of extended family that those of us born and raised in Tennessee carry with us like the proverbial torch. Sadly, it&#39;s a torch that&#39;s flickering badly as the South metamorphs into Everywhere Else, no longer the separate place that it has been for the last, say, 130 years. I think the secret of that Southernness is not that Southerners are more friendly than people from other areas, but that they are more willing to simply open the door to their lives and let you step in for a few minutes. Rather than addressing comments directly to you, it&#39;s more like you&#39;ve joined a show already in progress. <br><br>Another compartment of that Southernness is the acceptance of a landscape that&#39;s not totally based in objective reality. The Southern landscape used to be fraught with strangeness, all of us had our &quot;touched&quot; aunts and uncles, graveyards with our personal &quot;haints,&quot; strange tales and mythologies that followed us throughout our lives. The result of this whacked-out landscape is that the South, long considered the most conservative area in the country, is amazingly accepting of eccentricities, whether they&#39;re self-destructive or not. And our chosen way of dealing with this gothic landscape was humor. <br><br>&quot;Well, this is a funny story, Michael,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I did &#39;Peace Train&#39; on the album. I&#39;ve always loved Cat Stevens, and I always loved that song. I always intended to record that song someday, and I thought, &#39;Well, this is a great time, the shape of the world&#39;s in.&#39; So when we were working on the album, I was trying to think of what group would I like to have on this cut. I wanted something universal, you know. A choir sound, but <i>different</i>, you know? <br><br>&quot;So I was watching TV, and I saw a Lifesavers commercial, I heard these voices singing, and they had that real quiver, just like my voice, with all that emotion. That singing reminded me of Cat Stevens&#39; kind of quivery voice, and my own quivery voice with all the vibrato. So I got up from my chair where I was watching TV, and I called Steve Buckingham, who produced the album. I said, &#39;Steve, I don&#39;t know who it is, but whoever&#39;s singing the Lifesavers commercial, find out tomorrow, because that&#39;s who I want on &#39;Peace Train.&#39; So he called me back and said, &#39;You&#39;re not going to believe who&#39;s singing.&#39; I said, &#39;Who?&#39; &#39;Ladysmith Black Mambazo,&#39; he said. &#39;You know who that is?&#39; I said, &#39;Ain&#39;t that that group Paul Simon brought over from South Africa?&#39; Anyhow, that&#39;s who we used, and I thought that is perfect, because that&#39;s what I wanted, that universal sound. So anyway, I just thought it fit, and then when they were singing in Zulu, it kind of reminded me of back home when I grew up in the Holy Roller church, people talking in tongues. I started singing my little part at the end, when they were singing in Zulu...I felt like they were talking in tongues, and I was back in church. I said, &#39;Bless them, Lord. Whatever they&#39;re saying, bless them.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Dolly has a story for every song on the <i>Treasures</i> album, &quot;Some people might say one or two are out of character, but I tried to Dollyize &#39;em all....&quot; But then, I suspect that Dolly has a story for each and every song she&#39;s ever sung or written. She flickers back and forth between Hollywood icon and starstruck mountain girl, tells of movie flops and breathless trips to the old Ernest Tubb Record Shop in Nashville with the same equitable humor. <br><br>I want to make a couple points clear here. Most celebrities, whether they&#39;re from the music business or movies or even sports, turn their pasts, their personal stories, into commodities, little pieces of eight to be bartered away at the interview table or while the cameras are rolling. But (and I&#39;m as shocked by this as anybody) it&#39;s been exactly 20 years since the first time I sat down at an interview table with Dolly Parton, and that&#39;s a lot of Dolly Stories. I have always had the sense that Dolly tells her stories with such glee and such reverence both because she is a songwriter, and I suspect that songwriters see their story/songs in everything around them, and because it is the only way, the most Southern way, to hold onto pieces of a life that must fly by with numbing speed. <br><br>&quot;We were talking about country music,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;Well, I love it. I do other things, but that&#39;s my roots; it&#39;s my soul. I never go away from country and country music, but I have tried. But I am glad I have different things to work here and there. Because, like I said, before I crossed over, when I was being so totally true to country music, I wasn&#39;t making a dime. I couldn&#39;t even buy panty hose hardly. Because I had a bus on the road, and a band, and trying to pay bills, and trying to buy a house, and trying to keep a car, and I was going broke. People thought I was just rolling in dough, because I was having all these chart records, Number One records, &#39;Coat Of Many Colors,&#39; &#39;I Will Always Love You&#39; and &#39;Jolene.&#39; You know what? &#39;I Will Always Love You&#39; sold 100,000 copies, and &#39;Jolene&#39; sold 60,000 copies. &#39;Coat Of Many Colors&#39; didn&#39;t even sell that. I was starving. And I thought, I know I&#39;m better than that. I know that I&#39;m good enough to make a living at this. God would want me to make some money. I thought, what I am going to have to do? So I thought, I&#39;m going to broaden my appeal. I&#39;m going to have to cross over, try to get into bigger television, stuff like that. I made that choice, Michael, and I got crucified, as you remember, at the time. People thought I&#39;d made a major mistake. But if I hadn&#39;t of done that, I wouldn&#39;t have any money now. Because I&#39;ve done the other stuff... if I hadn&#39;t of made that move then, I wouldn&#39;t have the money now. Because I certainly wouldn&#39;t be making enough on country radio and in country music to make a living now, would I? &#39;Cause I ain&#39;t had no hits.&quot; <br><br>This single fact gnaws away at Dolly Parton, because, at her very heart, she is a singer and songwriter, remember, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; a modest country hit for Dolly, became the single best-selling pop song in history for Whitney Houston. And Dolly acknowledges that her song catalog is amazingly lucrative. (No doubt in the first years AW, After Whitney, most of the women singers in Los Angeles were probably mining the substantial Dolly Archives). It&#39;s not about money; believe me, if you happen to write the best-selling pop song of all time, you&#39;re not going to have to worry about where the next bologna and cheese sandwich is coming from. But what she wants, after the movies, after the television shows, after pop stardom, after gossip mags, plastic surgery, Beverly Hills, Dollywood, whatever, is a hit country record. <br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t stop writing songs. That&#39;s what I mean, I am <i>so</i> serious,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;If people really knew how serious I was about my music...I do still write like I&#39;m hungry; I still sing like I&#39;m hungry; and I am hungry. I&#39;m hungry for that part of the business that is so totally me, which is the music. It was my songs, and my singing, that brought me out of the Smokey Mountains, that really built the bridge into all of the other worlds that I&#39;ve been in and live in. It was all built with songs. It was all built with the songs I write. As long as I&#39;m living, I will always wish that I could write and sing and have it accepted, and have it played somewhere. But it is frustrating. You don&#39;t know hardly what to do. But like I said, it&#39;s not the money I need now, because I&#39;m making a living doing other stuff. I&#39;ve made more money doing outside things than I do with my music, which is unfortunate. Like I said, it&#39;s still the music that built the bridges, but...I&#39;m still hungry, you know?&quot; <br> She shakes her head in disgust. <br> &quot;I swear, Michael, I&#39;ve tried everything,&quot; she says. &quot;I even tried hanging onto the coattails of Billy Ray Cyrus, Tanya Tucker and Pam Tillis. Hell, I&#39;ve tried everything to get a record played on the radio, and I just can&#39;t hardly do it. But I knew what I was doing. At least I fessed up to it, and said what I was doing. I kept thinking, maybe that&#39;ll do it. That didn&#39;t do it either. So I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; <br> The <i>Treasures</i> album? <br> &quot;Because it&#39;s something I feel like doing,&quot; she says. &quot;These are great songs. It&#39;s a good time to do it, because, chances are, radio is not going to play any new and original things I&#39;m doing. They didn&#39;t play the last two albums. People are excited about the new record here. And I think it&#39;s a really good album. I think it&#39;s done really well. I just hope my performance is good enough to be played, but we&#39;ll just have to see.&quot; <br><br>In the meanwhile, her new television series is grinding toward completion. She first mentioned it to me almost three years ago. The series, which is based on a song Dolly wrote called &quot;Minding My Own Business,&quot; will debut in January, after a Christmas television movie titled <i>Unlikely Angel</i>, which follows a television special on the making of the <i>Treasures</i> album. The woman does know how to work. <br>&quot;The series had to be right,&quot; she says. &quot;Because you&#39;ve got to feel that the show is right before you go on, because I had that big ole flop with that variety show. I didn&#39;t want to go on again without being a little better prepared. At least, I&#39;ll be able to handle it a little better if this one goes down the tubes, because I&#39;ll know with all this preparation, if don&#39;t work...well, we gave it a shot. It&#39;s cute; it&#39;s fun; we&#39;ll see how it goes.&quot; <br><br>But about songwriting, Dolly begins again. In addition to knowing how to work, she also knows how to be persistent. <br>&quot;It&#39;s like, what do I have to do?&quot; she says. &quot;What can I do? Somebody tell me, I&#39;d be happy to do it, if they&#39;d tell me what they wanted me to do...I mean, I write all the time. It&#39;s like, I see it, I feel it, and it&#39;s like, oh, please, let me do what I do best, and accept it. Maybe one of these days I&#39;ll just say to hell with trying to be commercial, to hell with trying to see whether the songs are going to get played. Just do whatcha you do...Go do your TV shows, go do your movies, go do your stuff. And write, and write, and write, and put it down. And when you think it&#39;s right, put it out whatever it is. <br> &quot;But at least they&#39;ll play me in my hometown.&quot;  	</div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">April 15, 1997</font><br><br><b>Porter Wagoner: The Truth About Dolly &amp; Me</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><b>Porter Wagoner&#39;s life is forever linked to Dolly Parton&#39;s.<br><br></b> After replacing Norma Jean on <i>The Porter Wagoner Show</i> in 1967, Dolly became Porter&#39;s most famous duet partner and then left him to achieve superstardom on her own.<br>&quot;I loved Dolly then, and I love her now,&quot; Porter says. &quot;She&#39;s one of the nicest people I&#39;ve met in my life.&quot;<br>There was a time that statement would have been hard to believe. After seven years together on Porter&#39;s road show and TV program, and 21 hit duets, they had developed a close business and personal relation ship that went sour with the breakup.<br>The intensity of the relationship was such that its end inspired Dolly to write the classic &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; The hurt feelings came out in a lawsuit, later settled. <br>Porter now says the press blew the dispute out of proportion. <br>&quot;Dolly had reached the point where she was ready to go out on her own,&quot; he says. &quot;That was something we both had worked toward. But then, the lawyers got involved, and whenever that happens, they stir things up.&quot;<br>When they first met, Porter was the superstar and Dolly was one of a couple dozen women he interviewed as his new &quot;girl singer.&quot; <br>&quot;She was just a really nice-looking girl, nothing outstanding about her at the time,&quot; Porter says. &quot;I was impressed with her songwriting. She wrote a lot of songs about home, about Daddy&#39;s workin&#39; boots and those type things and Mama&#39;s old black kettle. They weren&#39;t great commercial songs, but they were well written and they were about subjects she knew about at that time back in East Tennessee.&quot; Dolly&#39;s looks played only a small role in getting her hired, Porter says. <br>&quot;Norma Jean, the girl that was leaving, was more of a household, housewife-looking girl, a very pretty, very clean, very wholesome look,&quot; Porter says. &quot;And, Dolly was a blonde and looked quite different from that . . . At that time she was dressing down more.&quot;<br>When Norma Jean left to marry her childhood sweetheart, the audiences didn&#39;t make it easy on Dolly, Porter says. <br>&quot;The first time she went out, Norma Jean was supposed to be there and she wasn&#39;t,&quot; Porter says. &quot;Dolly was her replacement and the people didn&#39;t like it at all. They were very mad at Dolly. They didn&#39;t like the way she sang or anything. That was a devastating moment for her I&#39;m sure. <br>&quot;We talked about it after the show that night. We were going to another concert up into Pennsylvania, and I told her what we need to do.&quot;<br>Porter told Dolly: &quot;Tonight, instead of sleeping, we need you to stay up and work on a couple of duets we can do to open your part of the show, and then I&#39;ll stay out there out there with you while you&#39;re talking to the people. <br>&quot;We learned &#39;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&#39; and another song called &#39;The Last Thing on My Mind,&#39; which we wound up recording, and it became the first record we released.&quot;<br>They worked together until 1974, when Dolly went solo. She had been increasingly unhappy with working for Porter, but once she left, it was his turn to seethe. <br>&quot;Part of my agreement with Dolly has been that when she went out on her own and was no longer part of my show, I&#39;d get a percentage of what she made for the next five years,&quot; Porter says. <br><br>To him, the arrangement was fair, he had produced Dolly&#39;s records without pay and had split the profits on the duets 50-50, though she was the newcomer and he the established star. <br>&quot;We had it in writing that once she left, it was time for me to be paid for some of the things I&#39;d done for her,&quot; he says. <br><br>Five years after Dolly left, Porter sued her. He claimed payments had not been made. Dolly later said she thought the payments had been made. The two settled out of court the following year. Time helped heal the wounds, and today they speak kindly about each other. <br><br>In her 1994 autobiography, <i>Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business</i>, Dolly wrote: &quot;Porter and I have outlived a lot of the hurt and bitterness we both felt and can once again share a stage from time to time when we work together. <br>&quot;There is no question he did a great deal for me and for country music. So, thank you, Porter Wagoner, for all the good you have brought me and forgive me for the bad, as I have forgiven you. <br>&quot;It&#39;s like the old saying, &#39;As good as you are and as bad as I am, I&#39;m as good as you are, as bad as I am.&#39;&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Paper Magazine</font><br><font size="2">July 1997</font><br><br><b>DISCO DOLLY<br><font size="1">Dolly Parton Re-mixes It Up With Junior Vasquez</font></b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Paper Magazine" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Paper Magazine" width="455"></div><br><br>Once upon a time in London in the late 70&#39;s, there was a little girl who stole 2 pounds 99 out of her mother&#39;s purse to take a bus into town to buy <i>Dolly Parton&#39;s Greatest Hits</i> from the Woolworth&#39;s on Streatham High Street. Having been promised the album for Christmas by her uncle and receiving instead a pink nylon book bag, there was nothing to be done but to resort to petty thievery. Twenty years later, I would still do anything for Dolly. <br><br>Readers beware: This is not a me-free interview; it would be fraudulent for me to write this without trying to explain my lifelong infatuation with the queen of country. She is my one childhood idol who I adore now as much as ever. As a girl, I thought Dolly was the most beautiful, glamorous creature I had ever seen. She sparkled and shined and told jokes and sang in a way I&#39;d never heard before. Dolly was a rare bird in Putney, England. As her hair grew bigger, my ardor grew stronger. And although I never actually &quot;did&quot; Dolly in the fashion sense, every rhinestone I ever pined for was an homage to her fabulousness, and every pair of white cowboy boots I secretly coveted had her name all over them. <br><br>When Dolly finally crossed the ocean to perform at the Royal Albert Hall in the early 80&#39;s, I watched the show from my front-row cushion, parked two inches form the family TV while Fleur Melville, the school slut, bully and general menace, had real front-row seats because her mother was a publicist. I cried intermittently for days, and it took me years to recover from the betrayal, the day that I first truly understood that life just isn&#39;t fair. But I never held it against Dolly; it wasn&#39;t her fault. As the decade drew to a close, Dolly&#39;s popularity in my home country waned and I seemed to stand alone on my island of adulation. It was only when, upon moving to the Americas, that I once again found the nourishment I needed to sustain my obsession and fellow addicts with whom to indulge it. <br><br>Now it&#39;s 1997, and I have the autobiographies, the dolls, the makeup line, the wig catalog, the soundtracks, the out-of-print books and magazines and the records, the most recent being <i>Treasures</i> (Rising Tide/MCA), and two remixes by New York&#39;s own dance-music maestro, Junior Vasquez. Like her husband of 30 years, Carl Dean, I&#39;ve been there with Dolly through all of her fashion incarnations, the weight changes, the plastic surgery, the 18-month depression and the innuendos and tabloid rumors alternating between nymphomania and lesbianism. And like Carl, I chose to ignore them all. I&#39;ve seen all the movies, <i>Nine to Five</i>, <i>Straight Talk</i>, <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i> and <i>Steel Magnolias</i> being my personal favorites. Obsession is a wonderful, fulfilling thing, so fuck you, Fleur: I got to have a date with Dolly at the Pierre Hotel. Sophie de Rakoff: Hey Dolly, do you remember me? I was the dork who chased you outside of indochine in L.A. back in January and had to say hello to you. <br><br><b>Dolly Parton</b>: Oh God, I don&#39;t remember. Was I nice to you? <br><br><b>SdR</b>: [Crushed.] Yeah, you were really sweet. You shook my hand and asked me my name. What&#39;s good on the menu here? <br><br><b>DP</b>: Oh, I eat things you probably wouldn&#39;t touch, like the goose liver. I just love these cheese toast things, though. I have &#39;em send a basket up to my room just so&#39;s I can crunch on &#39;em. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: So you&#39;re a disco diva now. <br><br><b>DP</b>: That&#39;s what they say. Apparently &quot;Peace Train&quot; is doing real well in the dance clubs. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: What does Cat Stevens make of your dance cover of his song? <br><br><b>DP</b>: We tracked him down to England to interview him for the CBS special I did last year for my album <i>Treasures</i>, which was when I originally recorded &quot;Peace Train.&quot; <br><br><b>SdR</b>: [Showing off.] Cat Stevens went to school with my dad when they were kids. My grandpa says he would come around the house and play guitar in the kitchen and inhale salami sandwiches. <br><br><b>DP</b>: [Beside herself.] Oh my God, that&#39;s amazing! He&#39;s such an incredible songwriter. I just love his music, and that&#39;s why I recorded the song. He&#39;s got a long, gray beard now that he&#39;s all religious, and he only agreed to do the interview as long as I didn&#39;t show too much of my body. I was pretty tasteful. I did show a little bit, but it was just the usual Dolly. I think he&#39;ll like it. We used a gospel choir. It&#39;s beautiful. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: You talk about yourself a lot in the third person. Is there a separation between you and your image? <br><br><b>DP</b>: I always kid about &quot;The Dolly,&quot; like she&#39;s my own creation, but really I created myself years ago and I physically re-create myself everyday. But that&#39;s about it. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: I bet you see lot of Dollys on Halloween. <br><br><b>DP</b>: It&#39;s the one time I can get out and not be recognized. I like to hang out the window and have people yell up at me, &quot;You make a good Dolly!&quot; I&#39;ve always joked and kidded, saying if I hadn&#39;t been a woman I&#39;d have been a drag queen, gaudy as I like to be! <br><br><b>SdR</b>: I heard there&#39;s a Dollywood Boulevard and a Frederick&#39;s of Dollywood in your theme park. <br><br><b>DP</b>: I just love to play around with all that stuff. People keep calling it &quot;Dolly World&quot; or &quot;Dolly Land,&quot; but it couldn&#39;t be anything else. It&#39;s Dollywood! <br><br><b>SdR</b>: I&#39;m sorry, this is a really crass question, but is it true you&#39;re worth $100 million? <br><br><b>DP</b>: I&#39;m more apt to count my blessings than my money. With all my companies and all the businesses, I&#39;m not quite sure how much I&#39;m worth, but all told I guess it&#39;s quite a bit. But I still wake up feeling like I&#39;m hungry and I gotta go to work everyday. I still want to be creative and productive, that&#39;s what brought me out of the Smoky Mountains to where I am today, and I will never give that up and rest on my laurels or my heinie. What about you? What&#39;s your full dream? <br><br><b>SdR</b>: [Horribly embarrassed.] Writing movies, I guess. <br><br><b>DP</b>: [Excited.] Well, write one for me! I need a hit movie! <br><br><b>SdR</b>: I loved <i>Straight Talk</i>, even if nobody else did. <br><br><b>DP</b>: It&#39;s hard to find a movie for me &#39;cause I&#39;m pretty picky and I&#39;m not that much in demand right now. Scripts come in all the time, but I don&#39;t get passionate about them. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Did you get burned by the failure of your variety show in the late 80&#39;s? <br><br><b>DP</b>: It&#39;ll drive you crazy if you let it, but you&#39;ve got to move on. You just can&#39;t imagine how so many so-called intelligent people can screw up so often and so fast. But it hasn&#39;t soured me on doing TV. I know that if I hit on something I want to do, it could be on the air for years, so I&#39;m being careful. But in the meantime, if you come up with a brilliant idea... <br><br><b>SdR</b>: I&#39;ll call Sandy Gallin? <br><br><b>DP</b>: Exactly. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: [Pulling something out of a bag.] Look what I&#39;ve got, Dolly, the &#39;78 <i>Playboy</i> interview you did. <br><br><b>DP</b>: [Peeing with delight.] Oh my God, where did you get that? Look how fat my arms are! We&#39;ve come a long way, baby! I said a lot in that interview. That was the first time I really opened up to the press. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: There&#39;s some pretty interesting sex stuff in there. How strict was your family?<br><br><b>DP</b>: Well, they were pretty strict, but somehow I never applied it to myself. Things have changed a lot since I got out in the world. When a woman in the part of the country I was from drank a beer, she was a whore. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: But you were always attracted to the trash, right? <br><br><b>DP</b>: What they considered trash in our hometown, I considered beautiful. When I saw the town tramp when I was a child, I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had this gorgeous blonde hair and lipstick and nail polish and a tight skirt with little heels. Everybody else was country and wore country clothes and smelled of sweat. I would stare at her and pull on mama and go, &quot;She&#39;s so purdy.&quot; And mama would say, &quot;Don&#39;t mind her, she&#39;s just trash.&quot; I had no idea what she meant, but I decided right then and there that that&#39;s what I wanted to be, &#39;cause it meant I would look like her. Then I would see her talking to guys and think, &quot;Gosh, she&#39;s so friendly....&quot; <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Would you ever leave the house without being made up?<br><br><b>DP</b>: I would only set foot on the street without all this junk if my husband was dying of a heart attack. He&#39;d have to be really sick. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Does it make you laugh that people still marvel at your boobs? <br><br><b>DP</b>: I&#39;ve always said I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m supporting them or they&#39;re supporting me, but they&#39;ve served me well. I love being girlie and I love my boobs. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Tell me about your friendship with your manager, Sandy Gallin. Your names are as synonymously linked as Elvis and the Colonel. <br><br><b>DP</b>: He&#39;s my dear, dear friend. We talk everyday on the phone and we have wonderful times together. If we&#39;re at dinner and he&#39;s at one end of the table and I&#39;m at the other, we can have more of a communication from a distance than some people can right next to each other. We only have to roll our eyes and the other one&#39;ll know what we&#39;re saying. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: What kind of places did you two hang out in back in the day? <br><br><b>DP</b>: Well, I&#39;ve never been much of a bar-hopper, but I&#39;ve walked through some pretty bizarre places with Sandy. He was real big in Studio 54, and I loved it, too &mdash; all the dancing and the energy. I just loved Steve Rubell. I was crazy about him and he was crazy about me. If I had a new record out or had done something, he would throw me parties. One time he brought in all these farm animals and there were bales of hay all over the place and country food. There were some funny things at Studio 54. I didn&#39;t partake of it much, but I saw it all and was fascinated. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Did anything ever freak you out? <br><br><b>DP</b>: Nothing ever freaked me out. I was always fascinated. My eyes would get wide and I&#39;d go, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; like I was on an adventure ride. The more bizarre people are, the more I&#39;m drawn to them. There&#39;s a great personality that runs in my family on both sides that gives us a good sense of humor and a good heart. I&#39;ve always been curious and nosy and wanted to know more. <br><br><b>SdR</b>: Did your life change at 50? <br><br><b>DP</b>: I think my life actually changed at 40. That&#39;s when you realize you can&#39;t ride the fence anymore. You either have to get on one side or the other. I think some of my best years were between 40 and 50: I got my priorities straight and life is good to me now. It&#39;s only other people who say, &quot;God, she&#39;s 50 years old!&quot; as if I&#39;m over the hill. I feel like I just started. Even today I laughed at myself with the clothes I was wearing and this dance mix. Oh my God, I&#39;ve been around so long I&#39;ve met myself coming back! </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">July 29, 1997</font><br><br><b>Her hometown charity programs show children books and the wild life</b></div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br>Dolly Parton calls it the Imagination Library. Kids think it&#39;s magic.<br><br> A group of preschoolers sit cross-legged on a rug outside their daycare center near Gatlinburg, Tenn. The Dollywood Imagination Express train is coming, and a special guest will read to them.<br>That guest is Dolly herself, who&#39;s spending the weekend taking a look at programs her Dollywood Foundation created to help children in Dolly&#39;s native Sevier (pronounced <i>severe</i>) County.<br>But as far as these 3- to 6-year-olds are concerned, Dolly&#39;s just a pretty lady, as bright and blonde and accessible as <i>Sesame Street</i>&#39;s Big Bird. After she plops herself down on the train&#39;s reading stool, she and the kids are soon deep into &quot;I Can Share.&quot;<br>It&#39;s as if Dolly is telling the story, not reading it, and they are entranced. Dolly&#39;s fame presents no barrier here: She is simply a warm, animated presence reading in a sweet, child-like voice.<br>&quot;We started the Imagination Library because we felt it would be great to get children interested in reading when they are most impressionable,&quot; Dolly says later. &quot;So we give every child born in Sevier County a free book every month until they start kindergarten.&quot;<br>Books were a luxury when Dolly was a child. &quot;We didn&#39;t have any, with the exception of the Bible and the Sears catalog,&quot; she says. &quot;I loved Bible stories, because my grandpa was a preacher and my mom was always reading the Bible. But when I went to school I loved every book I ever touched. I still read all the time. I love the peace and quiet, I love the pages, I love to <i>smell</i> a book.&quot;<br>After the story-telling is finished, Dolly joins children from Pi Beta Phi Elementary School at the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains Park. The kids an Dolly are blindfolded as a ranger leads them through a test of their senses.<br>Although Dolly&#39;s the only one walking around on 5-inch orange slingbacks, she&#39;s every bit as enthusiastic as her young companions. They stroke a fox fur, handle an animal bone, sniff homemade black walnut syrup and then guess at what they&#39;ve experienced.<br>Dolly scores well, failing only on the syrup. &quot;I thought it was chocolate,&quot; she says with a juicy giggle.<br>The rest of the day is a blur of meeting new employees at her Dollywood theme park and at L&#39;il Dolly&#39;s Dresses, her latest business venture on the Dollywood grounds.<br>&quot;We have our own factory, and everything is made here,&quot; she says, introducing her partners Don and Donna Hall. &quot;These people have been in business a long time, but everybody thought that it had to do with me anyhow, so we went into business together!&quot; She&#39;s not kidding; some of these employees are Dolly&#39;s aunts and cousins. <br><br>During the weekend, Dolly delighted audiences by showing up onstage. During one show, in which the cast usually does a medley of her tunes, Dolly waited backstage for her cue. <br><br>&quot;They finished all my songs, and the people who&#39;d heard I was on the grounds thought, well, she&#39;ll come out now if she&#39;s coming,&quot; says Dolly, whose appearance in a silky white dress and silver platform pumps brought the enthusiastic crowd to its feet. &quot;Word of mouth gets around that if I&#39;m in the park, I&#39;m liable to show up anytime,&quot; she says with a flirty little grin. &quot;Which I am!&quot; <br><br>After the show, Dolly ducks into her Celebrity Theater dressing room with its deep blue carpeting and white furniture, its walls lined with every album she&#39;s ever cut. She can still remember every detail of recording them, she says as she kicks off her shoes. &quot;Every single thing!&quot; she crows. &quot;I can even smell the perfume I wore with those clothes.&quot; <br><br>Each album tells a different story, she says, and that story adds up to her life. Another album, and another chapter in that life, will soon join these, she adds. &quot;I&#39;m writing songs right now, have been for several weeks. I don&#39;t know yet what the album&#39;s going to be, don&#39;t even know what the theme is. But I&#39;m on a writing binge. I&#39;ll write for two or three days without hardly sleeping or eating, take a nap, get up, make another pot of coffee and go again until I fall over. I <i>love</i> that.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">October 14, 1997</font><br><br><b>Dolly keeps busy waiting for her country comeback</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><b>Even when she&#39;s kidding, Dolly Parton isn&#39;t kidding.</b>  <br>&quot;My look is artificial, but my heart is real, my intentions are good and my talent is God-given,&quot; she tells COUNTRY WEEKLY. &quot;I take that very seriously.&quot; <br>Seriously enough to have another album in the works and a new stage show for her Dollywood theme park. Seriously enough to plan a limited tour and to even dream of creating a Broadway show.<br>And seriously enough that the 51-year-old superstar is looking for ways to connect with a new generation of country fans.<br>To much of the world, Dolly Parton <i>is</i> country music. But without a Top 20 hit on mainstream country radio since 1991, she wondered aloud last year whether she was &quot;wanted in country music anymore.&quot;<br>Asked about it now, during an interview at her successful theme park, she replies thoughtfully: &quot;I think my true fans still love me. I don&#39;t know about a lot of the new country fans. I think a lot of them are not that ware of who I am and what I do musically. Because we have a whole new generation.<br>&quot;I have no resentment toward that. I&#39;m just proud that country music&#39;s doing so well. I&#39;m just hoping to find a niche for myself where I can fit in somewhere and still be able to have records played and bought to where it would provide me the luxury of always having a reason to write and record.&quot;<br>Meanwhile, Dolly is finding new ways to fit in. Her recent dance mix of &quot;Peace Train,&quot; for instance, shot to the Top 5 on <i>Billboard</i>&#39;s dance chart. <br>&quot;Can you <i>believe</i> that?&quot; she blurts out. &quot;<i>I</i> couldn&#39;t believe it! We took this Cat Stevens song completely apart, kept my voice and added dance music &mdash; and now it&#39;s one of the biggest dance records in the <i>world</i>!&quot; <br>Dolly starts to giggle. &quot;I&#39;ve even seen articles that say, &#39;Dolly the Dance Diva&#39; and &#39;Disco Dolly.&#39; I fall over laughing, but it&#39;s great to have a hit record, no matter how you get it.&quot; <br> <br>Dolly&#39;s working on her next album, <i>Hungry Again</i>, in a small studio at the Nashville home of her first cousin Richie Owens. <br>&quot;He&#39;s a wonderful engineer and producer,&quot; Dolly says with a smile. Then she starts to laugh. &quot;We&#39;ve been working in his basement. His little kids come running through, and you can hear kids crying and people hollering and trucks going by outside. It&#39;s an honest, heartfelt, sweet record.&quot; It&#39;s also, she promises, more like her earlier music.<br>Her 1996 album, <i>Treasures</i>, offered a sampler of Dolly&#39;s favorite songs, written by others. For the new album, she took pen in hand. <br>&quot;I have written some of the best songs since &#39;Coat Of Many Colors&#39; and &#39;I Will Always Love You,&#39;&quot; she says, sounding satisfied. &quot;It&#39;s more like the early years of Dolly, songs that people seem to still like.&quot; She emphasizes that point in a song she wrote for the album, due this spring on Rising Tide/Blue Eye, called &quot;Let&#39;s Love Like We&#39;re Hungry Again.&quot;&quot;I wanted to write like I was hungry again, sing like I was hungry again, hungry just for being back in the business in that way,&quot; she says. &quot;I figured it would be safest to just do what was truly honest and totally from my soul.&quot;I would love to have more than just <i>a</i> hit record. I&#39;d love to always be in the mainstream of music, because my favorite thing is to write and to sing the songs I write. I would love, even when I&#39;m an old woman, to have a music career and have it respected and appreciated.&quot;<br>Despite her forays into dance music and acting, the country audience remains closest to her heart.&quot;You&#39;d have to be crazy not to know I&#39;m country,&quot; she says, dressed in a glittery peach mini-skirted business suit. &quot;You can hear me <i>talk</i> and know I&#39;m still country,&quot; she says with a tickled laugh. &quot;I&#39;m Dolly, I don&#39;t look like Hollywood any more than I look like Frog Alley.&quot;<br>Nope. She&#39;s Dolly, the girl from Sevier County in the mountains of East Tennessee, who grew beyond its confines without ever leaving it. As she walks into Dollywood&#39;s barn-like Mountain Crafts Market Place, she greets its artists as the friends they often are. Outside, a covey of fans, many wearing her &quot;Peace, Love, Dollywood&quot; T-shirts, wait anxiously for a glimpse of the legend that Dolly has become.<br>This legend is doing a benefit concert for her Dollywood Foundation today, and despite her 30 years of experience, she still gets wound up. <br>&quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I did a full concert where I did a lot of my own music,&quot; says Dolly. She admits, &quot;I&#39;m a little nervous and a whole lot excited.&quot; Then she flashes one of those safe-at-home grins and adds, &quot;It&#39;s always good to do it at home, because if you mess up they&#39;ll forgive you.&quot;<br>Her good deeds at home are about to go national, if all goes well, she will expand her books-for-kids program, the Imagination Library.&quot;A lot of people are interested in this program &#39;cause it&#39;s working so well, so we&#39;re hoping that we might be able to do it on a larger scale. But for now, we&#39;re happy with the results we&#39;ve had here. We send every child in Sevier County a free book every month from the day they&#39;re born until they start kindergarten. That way parents can read with the children, so it&#39;s a nice thing for families as well as children.&quot; <br><br>For months now, Dolly has watched hundreds of videos of her career. In April, the best clips will be part of a new stage show at Dollywood. <br><br>&quot;This particular show does have some hints of a Broadway,&quot; she says. &quot;We&#39;re putting it together as a musical, like the climb of my life, from songs we&#39;ve already recorded. It&#39;s my life story from the beginning of my career, with a lot of film footage and videos and comments by people who have helped me through the years.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s been involved with almost every phase, including the search for someone to play her. &quot;I have to find the person to play little Dolly and the teenage Dolly,&quot; she says. Then she snickers. &quot;I guess I can always be the <i>old</i> Dolly.&quot; <br><br>The Dollywood production could be a dry run for yet another of her projects, writing new songs for a real Broadway show. &quot;When I do a show for Broadway it would be my whole life in song, like different stories and stuff where it would be original, a lot of original music,&quot; she says. <br><br>There are, she admits, a lot of powerful moments in her career. &quot;The first time I performed in front of a live audience on the Cas Walker show when I was like 10 years old in Knoxville. Then when I first sang on the Grand Ole Opry, and then when I started with the Porter Wagoner show, 1966, I guess it was.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s been watching Porter&#39;s old shows and thinks they&#39;re a hoot. <br>&quot;I see them and I just fall over,&quot; she says with a big cackle. &quot;I can&#39;t hardly stand to watch myself like that. I think, &#39;Oh my God, look at that hair!&#39; Then I look in the mirror and think, &#39;Oh Lord, it&#39;s still there.&#39;&quot; <br><br>And the dynamic woman beneath the hair is still here. <br>&quot;I&#39;m full of energy, full of ideas, full of activity,&quot; she says, speaking quickly and emphatically. &quot;I love to write, love to work, love to be busy. Can&#39;t <i>stand</i> to be bored. <br>&quot;If I ain&#39;t nothing, I get bored, and if I get bored, I get dangerous. <br>She smiles again. &quot;Best I keep working.&quot;  	</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">McCalls</font><br><font size="2">January 1996</font><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="McCalls" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="McCalls" width="455"></div><br><br>&quot;Honey, you need some fringe and flash.&quot; With a once-over, Dolly Parton determines what it will take to turn a black-clad New Yorker into someone who&#39;d fit right in at the Grand Ole Opry. Parton, after all, is an expert at packaging: Decked out in a low-cut black-and-white polka-dot minidress, matching mules and earrings, and hair bigger than the state of Texas, she&#39;s every inch the image she&#39;s spent more than 40 years creating. &quot;I&#39;m sure I look stupid or trashy to other people,&quot; she says defiantly. &quot;Folks say to me, &#39;Aren&#39;t you getting too old to wear that kind of stuff?&#39; But this is who I am, all the paint, powder and polka dots.&quot; <br><br>This month, Parton will turn 50, a sobering milestone for most women but a mere stepping stone for her. &quot;Fifty may sound terrible, but it doesn&#39;t feel terrible to me,&quot; she says. &quot;I look at it as a beginning. It&#39;s taken me so long to get where I am, to know myself and what I want, and what I <i>don&#39;t</i> want is to go out to pasture!&quot; <br><br>There seems to be little chance of that. Parton has visions of her Dollywood themepark going global, and she&#39;s planning to create children&#39;s books, albums and videos. <br><br>Yet despite all the brass, sass and ambition, Parton harbors surprising insecurities. She jokes constantly, and a lot of her wise-cracks are directed at herself: Driving down Nashville&#39;s Music Row, she spies a billboard heralding her latest album, <i>Something Special</i>. &quot;Don&#39;t that just figure?&quot; she laughs, noting its location. &quot;Right smack next door to the Piggly Wiggly supermarket!&quot; <br><br>Though now svelte, Parton won&#39;t let herself forget her &quot;pigging out&quot; period when she carried a hefty 150 pounds on her five-foot frame. &quot;Lordy, I was a hog!&quot;<br><br>And while dozens of stores in the city hawk Dolly merchandise (key chains, T-shirts, baseball hats), Parton claims, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like a complete success yet. I&#39;ve got the country thing, but I want to have a consistent streak of really big hits on the pop charts. I&#39;ve never had that, I go hot and cold.&quot; It&#39;s been nearly a decade since one of her albums,1987&#39;s <i>Trio</i> with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, crossed over to the Top 10 pop chart.<br>Parton also yearns to make her mark in movies, over the years she&#39;s had a few successes (<i>Nine To Five</i>, <i>Steel Magnolias</i>) and a few flops (<i>Rhinestone</i>, <i>Straight Talk</i>, <i>The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas</i>). &quot;I like acting if I understand the role,&quot; she says. &quot;Then it comes naturally to me. But I&#39;m no good at bull, so if a role doesn&#39;t fit, I can&#39;t make it.&quot; She&#39;s also eager for TV triumphs, perhaps remembering her less-than-successful weekly variety show in 1987-88. She&#39;s spent two years developing a sitcom for CBS, about an ex-singer who owns a beauty shop, which she hopes will finally see the light of day this spring. And this month, she begins filming the musical <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i> for a CBS television movie in May.<br>When reminded of all she <i>has</i> accomplished (countless Grammys and Country Music Association awards, a star on the Walk of Fame, even an Oscar nomination for her song &quot;Nine To Five&quot; and a rumored $100 million empire consisting of wigs, cosmetics, film production and Dollywood.), Parton fidgets in her seat. &quot;I <i>am</i> thankful for everything I have,&quot; she insists. &quot;I know how far I&#39;ve come.&quot; <br><br>Her background, in fact, is the stuff of rags-to-riches legends: Parton and her 11 brothers and sisters shared a cabin in the Smoky Mountains and wore coats stitched together from swatches of cloth. Her talent and her fiery determination put her, at six, in the spotlight of her grandfather&#39;s church choir. Seven years later, she landed a recording contract. &quot;I wanted to be a star,&quot; she says. &quot;I just wasn&#39;t gonna take no for an answer.&quot;<br>That&#39;s still true today. &quot;I&#39;m never satisfied,&quot; Parton says. &quot;I have so much energy that if I don&#39;t channel it creatively, I turn it on myself and get depressed.&quot;<br>And with that drive and creativity comes an undeniable steeliness. People who think she&#39;s a pushover should think again: &quot;I&#39;d hate to think I&#39;m <i>that</i> vanilla,&quot; she admits. &quot;I try to be friendly, but when people are mean, I just want to say, &#39;Stick it where the sun don&#39;t shine.&#39; Sometimes I do.&quot;<br>Her determination has helped her weather controversy as well. Tabloids have had a field day with her friendship with Judy Ogle (they&#39;ve been &quot;constant companions&quot; since they were in the Sevier County High School Band together) and have accused her of having affairs with any number of men, including Burt Reynolds (her costar in <i>The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas</i>) and country Casanova Billy Ray Cyrus. Her husband of 30 years, Carl Dean, prefers to ignore that talk and stay out of the spotlight; he and Parton are never photographed, and rarely even seen, together.<br>&quot;People always ask me if I&#39;ve had extramarital affairs,&quot; Parton says. &quot;You can just draw your own conclusions. All I will say is my husband is a wonderful man and we&#39;ll be together till one of us dies. I wouldn&#39;t want to know is he was having an affair, and he wouldn&#39;t want to know if I was.&quot; <br><br>An admitted plethora of plastic surgeries (&quot;nips, tucks and several sucks&quot;) leaves people wondering what is, and isn&#39;t, the real Dolly. &quot;I don&#39;t itemize,&quot; she laughs. &quot;But I don&#39;t see harm in making yourself look better when you&#39;re in the public eye. Sometimes I see myself on TV and think, &#39;What is that turkey jowl hanging from my neck?&#39; or &#39;I better get my pair off the ground!&#39; That&#39;s when I do something about it, and I&#39;ll continue to do so as the need arises, or, in my case, falls.&quot; <br><br>While she won&#39;t apologize for her actions or her outspokenness, Parton will admit to at least one regret in her life. &quot;I used to think I wished I had kids,&quot; she says. &quot;But now I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what God intended me for. I have a lot of kids that I&#39;m &#39;Aunt Granny&#39; to in my family, and I think I probably make a better aunt than a momma. This way there&#39;s more of me to go around.&quot; <br><br>Many of Parton&#39;s songs are about regrets: love affairs gone sour, misplaced trust, the man who got away. She&#39;s re-recorded three of her hits, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;The Seeker&quot; (all of which she wrote), not to wallow in the past but to give them new meaning and, hopefully, a new younger audience. &quot;I&#39;ve lived and loved all the songs on my albums in one way or another,&quot; she says. &quot;Writing music is like going to a psychiatrist for me. I just write about my feelings, nothing I experience goes to waste.&quot; <br><br>Inspiration for future songs may come from an unusual source: the O.J. Simpson trial, which Parton, like most Americans, was glued to all summer. &quot;I would like to write about it, I found it fascinating,&quot; she says. &quot;I hate to see people&#39;s lives in a mess, but I was intrigued by these lawyers and their games. I think if I&#39;d been on that jury, I would have come to the same conclusion, there&#39;s always reasonable doubt. And I believe if O.J. did it, he&#39;ll pay anyway. But it did bring many things out into the open, like domestic feuds and racism. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see racial harmony in this lifetime unless God intervenes.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country America</font><br>April 1996<br><br><b>&quot;The Softer Side of Dolly&quot;<br></b><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country America" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country America" width="455"><br><br><div align="left"><br>Security is super tight at Dollywood this morning. Just inside the roped off area is <i>Country America&#39;s</i> exclusive spot for a photo shoot, the ten feet of pathway between the picket fence surrounding Elf Land and the trellis marking the exit to Fantasy Land. Dolly will pause but not pose as she tours the new children&#39;s attraction she&#39;s opening up today. <br><br>It&#39;s a typical Dolly day. Everything is planned and choreographed down to the split second. So, three hours later, as you sit waiting in her dressing room, you&#39;re wondering why she&#39;s late. You were supposed to have a half hour for an interview. Somehow, that got whittled down to 20 minutes from 3:30 to 3:50 p.m. Yet, here it is 3:45 p.m. and still no Dolly. What makes it really strange is that all afternoon you&#39;ve been getting updates that she&#39;s running 5, no 7 minutes, now almost 15 minutes ahead of schedule. <br><br>At 3:50 she blows into the room, overwhelming everyone in it with a combination of folksy warmth and boardroom power. A quick trip to the ladies&#39; room and she&#39;s ready for a knee-to-knee, no-nonsense interview. Today&#39;s topic: her latest program to help preschoolers in her home county of Tennessee learn to read. The project is going to cost the Dollywood Foundation more than a million dollars to give all the children in Sevier County a book each month from the time they are born until they enter kindergarten. <br><br>First question: Why? Why take on such an ambitious project? <br><br>&quot;Because I&#39;m the luckiest person in the world,&quot; says Dolly. &quot;I&#39;ve worked very hard, but I also know that a lot of people work hard and never get to see their dreams come true. I just want every kid in this county to have the opportunity to be and do whatever they want to do.&quot; <br><br>Sound a little corny? Not when you hear Dolly say it. She&#39;s sincere. As her entourage filters out of the room, her metabolism shifts down a gear and she continues to talk about &quot;her people.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m very, very proud of these people,&quot; she says, &quot;and I hope they are proud of me. Most everybody in these parts is poor, but being poor doesn&#39;t keep you from your dreams. Lack of confidence or parents so busy they don&#39;t have time to make their children feel important are the things that stand between kids and their dreams. My mother always encouraged me and believed in my dreams no matter how silly they seemed to other people. I would always say things to her like, &#39;Oh, Mama, one of these days I&#39;m gonna build you a house so big it&#39;ll take you two days to walk from the bedroom to the kitchen.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Dolly is a dreamer but also a realist. She know that some parents of the mountain families she&#39;s trying to help won&#39;t be able to read the new books she will be buying their children because their own schooling was cut short. <br><br>&quot;My father never had a chance to go to school, so he can&#39;t read or write,&quot; says Dolly. &quot;It&#39;s not so much of an embarrassment as it is a disadvantage. If our family would have had this chance when I was a little girl, I&#39;m sure Daddy would have said, &#39;Look, honey, I&#39;m not able to read this to you, so let&#39;s go get your sister, who can read, to help us with it.&#39;&quot; <br><br>But if there are disadvantages to living in the secluded valleys of the Smokey Mountains, Dolly is quick to point out that the young people there also have a lot of advantages. <br><br>&quot;You know, kids in this part of the country are very lucky in some ways. Sure, they don&#39;t have a lot of money, but the people here are very loving and caring, and they have a great sense of pride,&quot; says Dolly. &quot;I sometimes think everybody here tries a little harder because they&#39;re just too proud to say they failed. I also believe there&#39;s a big plus to just being surrounded by the great natural beauty of this area.&quot; <br><br>Into this moment of softness, when the superstar business tycoon has let her guard down, you wonder out loud, &quot;Dolly, why don&#39;t you have any children of your own? Looking back, now that you&#39;ve just turned 50, don&#39;t you regret that?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not really,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ve got more family than I can handle. I&#39;ve been married for 30 years. In the early days, Carl and I used to think we wanted kids, and for years we didn&#39;t have any. Now it&#39;s too late. I realize that God didn&#39;t intend for me to have kids so I could be everybody&#39;s mama and everybody&#39;s granny. I feel like it. I have lots of kids. I&#39;m everybody&#39;s Aunt Granny, that&#39;s what they call me, you know, my nieces and nephews.&quot; <br><br>Suddenly, Dolly realizes it&#39;s 4:03 p.m. The spell is broken. &quot;Gotta go,&quot; she says, &quot;I still have two interviews before the tree lighting ceremony. Bye-bye. Thanks.&quot; <br><br>The softer side of Dolly swishes out the door with a smile and a wave. She transforms back into Dolly the Institution. She&#39;s made up a few minutes, and she&#39;s almost back on schedule. <br><br>Speaking of schedules, why was she so late? What possibly could have thrown steamroller Dolly Parton off schedule? Executives, consultants, business meetings? <br><br>&quot;Well, she probably doesn&#39;t want me telling this,&quot; confides her public relations aide, &quot;but she had us shave ten minutes off each interview so she could have a half hour to spend with four terminally ill kids with a wish here at the park today. And you know Dolly, once she gets started visiting kids, she just can&#39;t get away.&quot;</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">May 21, 1996</font><br><br><b>Fans see double as she reopens Dollywood theme park</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Country Weekly" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Country Weekly" width="455"></div><br><br><div align="left">A proud Dolly Parton literally beat her renowned chest as she celebrated the reopening of her Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.<br><blockquote><br></blockquote>Stars, both real and look-alike, helped Dolly start her 11th season at the park and show off its newest attraction, the $8 million Dollywood Boulevard that salutes Hollywood movies. <br>In keeping with the Tinseltown theme, a 3-D trio of real friends, Sandra Dee, Dom DeLuise and Phyllis Diller, were joined by celebrity look-alikes of Marilyn Monroe, the Blues Brothers, Tom Jones, Elvis Presley, Liberace, Roy Orbison . . . and Dolly Parton!<br>The real Dolly performed a duet with her look-and-sound-alike. &quot;I&#39;ve been going so fast that I&#39;ve met myself coming back,&quot; the star marveled.<br>Her reopening weekend also included serving as grand marshal for a parade through Pigeon Forge, a three-song mini-concert and some spicy bantering with fans. <br> &quot;Do the Tarzan yell,&quot; one fan shouted. <br> &quot;I can&#39;t do the yell because I&#39;m going to sing today and I have to save my throat,&quot; <br>Dolly replied. &quot;But I <i>can</i> beat my chest,&quot; she said, and did so to the audience&#39;s laughter and whoops.

I&#39;m 50, but I still feel like 30.&quot;<br><br> As Dolly likes to point out, she has plenty of other irons in the fire, including: <br><br><ul><li>A one-hour CBS-TV special Nov. 30 centered on <i>Treasures</i>, a tasty collection of mostly country classics and other personal favorites;</li></ul><ul><li>A starring role in a CBS-TV movie <i>Unlikely Angel</i>, airing Christmas week;</li></ul><ul><li>A CBS sitcom, <i>Minding My Own Business</i>, which is scheduled to debut in January with Dolly as the star. &quot;It&#39;s about a working girl . . . fish out of water . . . country girl living in L.A. . . . running my business there . . . catering to all the stars,&quot; she related. The pilot will be shot in December;</li></ul><ul><li>A Gospel musical she just sold to ABC-TV, <i>High and Mighty</i>, named after a song she wrote. She&#39;ll star in the production, set to air within a year;</li></ul><ul><li>And &quot;lots of movies-of-the-week in development&quot; by her Sanddollar Production company, which is based in Los Angeles.</li></ul><br> <br><i>Treasures</i>, on the new Rising Tide/Blue Eye label, is nearest and dearest to her heart, however. It&#39;s an 11-track album that, uncharacteristically for Dolly, contains not one song she wrote herself.<br><br>&quot;These are songs I&#39;ve always loved, and for years I&#39;ve wanted to do a great country album of some of my favorite country songs,&quot; she explained.<br>&quot;I got to see a dream of mine come true a couple of years ago when I did Heartsongs live at Dollywood. It was the old mountain folk songs, the songs my mama taught me. That was one dream, so this was the other dream.<br>&quot;In fact, if <i>Treasures</i> does well, I want to do a Volume I, Volume II, Volume III. Like every five years or so, I&#39;d like to do a classic album of my favorite country songs.<br>&quot;These were just some that I thought were real special. They all had some very personal meaning to me, and they touched my life in one way or another.<br>&quot;With the exception of &#39;Peace Train,&#39; &#39;Walking On Sunshine,&#39; and &#39;After The Goldrush,&#39; they&#39;re very rooted in country music. Those others just happened to be favorite songs of mine.&quot; <i>Treasures</i> contains such country standards as Merle Haggard&#39;s &quot;Today I Started Loving You Again,&quot; Freddy Fender&#39;s &quot;Before The Next Teardrop Falls,&quot; Charlie Rich&#39;s &quot;Behind Closed Doors,&quot; Jeanne Pruett&#39;s &quot;Satin Sheets&quot; and Ray Price&#39;s &quot;For The Good Times.&quot;<br>The first single, however, is a cover of the beautiful Randy Vanwarmer pop hit &quot;Just When I Needed You Most.&quot;<br>&quot;It actually played on pop radio stations, but to me, it always had a very country feeling and a very country story,&quot; Dolly told us. &quot;It seemed to fit in the country vein.&quot;<br>Among the guest stars providing harmony vocals on the album are Alison Krauss, The Mavericks&#39; Raul Malo, David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, Suzanne Cox, John Popper of Blues Traveler and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. <br><br>Dolly&#39;s last No. 1 single came in 1991 with &quot;Rockin&#39; Years,&quot; a duet with Ricky Van Shelton. She had 22 other No. 1s, starting in 1971 with &quot;Joshua,&quot; and with Porter Wagoner racked up 14 Top 10 hits between 1967 and 1980. Dolly&#39;s &quot;PMS Blues&quot; peaked at No. 70 in 1994, but in 1995 she and Vince Gill reached No. 15 in <i>Billboard</i> with her oft-recorded &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s really hard to say&quot; what it will take to return to the top, she said. &quot;I&#39;m very, very proud of the new country people. I don&#39;t begrudge them one bit of their success. I just wish there was room for some of us older folks who are still very serious about our music and still hopefully can make good records.<br>&quot;With me being in the business as long as I have been, being very serious as a writer and a singer, I figure I&#39;m better off just to try to go back to doing what comes from my gut, from my heart and from my soul.<br>&quot;Because I&#39;ve tried to cater a little bit to the new country when I did &#39;Romeo&#39; with Billy Ray Cyrus and some of them; I rode along on the coattails of some of my young friends. That didn&#39;t help me, either,&quot; she said, laughing.<br>&quot;I&#39;m a very serious artist; my music means more to me than anything, even though I&#39;m lucky enough to get to do many other things. I still have a yearning and a desire to have hit records and to be a successful recording artist.<br>&quot;I do it because music is my gut, my heart and my soul. To me, it&#39;s about the music. It&#39;s about the gift God gave me. It&#39;s something I have to do. It was my songs and the music that brought me out of the Smoky Mountains that put me in all the other areas that I am in today. It&#39;s still my music that burns at me more than any other thing.&quot; <br><br>Hindsight is always 20/20, but we wondered aloud if perhaps Dolly&#39;s various entertainment endeavors spread her too thin, that this was why she&#39;s had such a long drought in country music.<br>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied sharply. &quot;I think if I hadn&#39;t done exactly what I did, I would have starved to death and died out by now.<br>&quot;If I hadn&#39;t made the moves that I made, I would not be successful today in all the ways I am successful.<br>&quot;What is good about the things I do, like I&#39;m starting a TV series after the first of the year, and there will be music in that; I will write the theme song, everything that I do, there&#39;s still an outlet for my music.<br>&quot;Even Dollywood, the themepark, still has to do with music. We have so much music all over the park, and when I do home we do our concerts every year. <br><br>&quot;So everything is still an outlet for my work,&quot; says Dolly, who shudders at the thought of anything else. &quot;I look at a lot of my older friends that have gone by the wayside, that are starving to death, that live in houses they can&#39;t afford, and are still longing for that dream they once had and can&#39;t afford today. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just thankful that I used my good sense, my business sense, and did exactly what I did. So I have no regrets there. My only regret is that I&#39;m not being able to be a consistent recording artist and have one hit after another. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not like something that eats at me,&quot; she added. &quot;It&#39;s just something I wish was natural. I wish it was as natural for me to have hit records as it is for me to sing and to write. <br><br>&quot;I do think people relate to me. I think they know I came from the salt of the earth, so to speak, from a big family. All the things people relate to: home, family, church. I grew up in all those ways. <br><br>&quot;Of course, I&#39;m a little bizarre and a little squirrelly. But that&#39;s OK; I think people can relate to that, too. I think people know that they can relate to me. They have lived the songs I write. I think I touch them in some way because they are me and I am them, and it&#39;s not that different.&quot; <br><br>She partly attributes her long absence from the higher chart positions to lack of label support. &quot;First of all, the last few years I&#39;ve been with labels that thought I was over the hill as a recording artist. If you&#39;re over 30 in this business, in this day and time, usually you&#39;re not accepted.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s been accepted with open arms, and open pocketbooks, by her new label. And with that support, she says: &quot;I just hope that I can continue to do great work. I hope fans&#39;ll like some of the new stuff I&#39;m doing and just know that I&#39;m going to be working as hard as I ever have. I&#39;m still as convinced as I ever was that this is my life&#39;s work and that I&#39;m always going to try to do something to please the fans. <br><br>&quot;If I don&#39;t, it&#39;s certainly not because I&#39;ve not been trying.&quot;  	</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">New Country</font><br><font size="2">November 10, 2006</font><br><br><b>Here She Comes Again!</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="New Country" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="New Country" width="455"></div><br><br>It&#39;s not hard to imagine Dolly Parton working a high-stakes poker game, bidding a tableful of men into bankruptcy with a sweet country smile. That legendary ample figure would distract her opponents while she raised their bets, and when she walked away with the winnings, she might write a song about how Lady Luck favors girls, maybe as an answer to Kenny Rogers&#39; &quot;The Gambler.&quot; Parton knows a lot about fortune <i>and</i> strategy, she&#39;s played her looks, wits and talent into a career lasting more than 30 years, making her country music&#39;s most internationally famous star and one of the richest people in Nashville. A singer-songwriter with 65 albums to her name, she also moonlights as an actress, runs a TV production company, and lends her name to a theme park, Dollywood, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. <br><br>A round of interviews is in the cards for Parton today, a rare occasion. Though accessible to fans, she normally avoids speaking to the press at any length. But, with a handful of forthcoming projects to promote, Parton has ensconced herself in the Nashville office of her new record label, Rising Tide. Her blond hair is fluffed and feathered into a glamorous &#39;do, her bustline poured into a low-cut lavender chamois-cloth dress decorated with fringe. &quot;You gotta see my little purse! Show her my purse,&quot; she says to her assistant at the far end of the conference-room table, who holds up a matching multicolored leather patchwork bag. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the cutest thang you ever seen? <br><br>&quot;We can cover miles and miles in an hour,&quot; she says, with the bubbly enthusiasm that has become a hallmark of her persona. But Parton&#39;s songwriting reveals another side of her character not immediately evident upon meeting her. Some of these often melancholy compositions, such as &quot;Jolene,&quot; &quot;Coat Of Many Colors&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; are now classics of the country music canon. Ballads have always been Parton&#39;s forte, a product of her upbringing around the Appalachian oral tradition, still rich in the &#39;50s at the dawning of the TV era. Stories told by kinfolk for evening entertainment impressed her as a child. <br><br>&quot;I used to write a lot of stories when I was young, and make up all kinds of characters,&quot; she says. &quot;And the more I can see them, the more I enjoy writing them. I love to write, that&#39;s my favorite thing that I do. And I love to write story songs. In fact, years ago I got criticized for that by Porter Wagoner and Chet Atkins, and several people that were in the business at the time. They said, &#39;You&#39;re writing too many damn story songs. You need to write something more commercial. Just write a song that&#39;s got a verse, a chorus and a verse.&#39; I said, &#39;But I love to write those story songs. I love to create a character, I love to take &#39;em on a journey.&#39; Then, story songs got to be a big hit. And I had already tried to write the more commercial things.<br><br>&quot;But I do love the characters that I try to write. I do write &#39;em all like they could be a movie. They <i>are</i>, in my head.&quot; Parton&#39;s writing has won her fans throughout the worlds of country, rock, pop and folk. Her greatest recent success has been Whitney Houston&#39;s cover of &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; a major hit from the soundtrack of <i>The Bodyguard</i>. But her newly completed album <i>Treasures</i> doesn&#39;t feature her own compositions. Like 1994&#39;s <i>Heartsongs</i>, which showcased Parton&#39;s interpretations of traditional mountain tunes, <i>Treasures</i> is a collection of covers. It is a songwriter&#39;s compendium of best-loved songs, all chosen by Parton. As an artist, Parton has never shied away from risk, and <i>Treasures</i> shows her taking some of the greatest creative leaps yet. <br><br>&quot;I had what I thought was a wonderful idea for an album, of all these spectacular songs that had not been done to death,&quot; she recalls. &quot;They were such classic songs, and good songs, that they would be brand new to the listeners and artists in that new world of country. And they would be so loved and appreciated by the older folks.&quot; Doug Morris, chairman of the MCA Music Entertainment Group which encompasses Rising Tide, took Parton&#39;s idea to label head Ken Levitan as a prospect for the new company&#39;s first release. Having Parton on the Rising Tide roster would attract younger artists to sign with the label, and Levitan also recognized that Parton&#39;s idea fit well with the label&#39;s goal to combine commerciality with musical integrity. &quot;My whole aim,&quot; he says, &quot;is to have artists who have substance to what they do, not a flash in a pan, while we are also aiming for country radio, the country audience.&quot; <br><br>It comes as a surprise to Levitan that Parton previously had been unable to sell this album concept to a record company. &quot;I had tried to pass this idea along to different labels at different times,&quot; Parton says, &quot;and everybody said that it wasn&#39;t an album that I should do, that I should do songs that I wrote.&quot; Rising Tide bought <i>Treasures</i> immediately. <br><br>&quot;I have them a list of songs, and I said that I had some ideas for some special guest artists on it, artists that were in the new country, although they all had a personal meaning to me.&quot; Seven of <i>Treasures</i>&#39; 11 tracks feature cameo performances from a wide variety of artists. Hargus &quot;Pig&quot; Robbins, who played piano on the original recording of &quot;Behind Closed Doors,&quot; tinkles the ivories again on Parton&#39;s version. Alison Krauss, a veteran Parton collaborator from <i>Heartsongs</i>, whom Parton has called &quot;my sister in a former life,&quot; sings on &quot;After The Goldrush&quot; (along with Suzanne Cox) and &quot;Just When I Needed You Most.&quot; John Sebastian, who played autoharp on the original issue of that song, appears again here. David Hidalgo from Los Lobos sings backup on &quot;Before The Next Teardrop Falls.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I wanted someone who had the Spanish flavor,&quot; Parton says, &quot;because the old Freddy Fender record, he sang part of that in Spanish, which I thought was so effective and wonderful.&quot; <br><br>John Popper of Blues Traveler sings a soulful accompaniment to &quot;Today I Started Loving You Again.&quot; &quot;I just loved his voice,&quot; Parton says. &quot;It sounds like Joe Cocker and Otis Redding to me. The first time I ever heard him I thought, &#39;Someday I&#39;m going to sing something with him.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Raul Malo from the Mavericks got word from his manager that Parton wanted him to sing on &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Cross Over.&quot; &quot;Artists don&#39;t talk to each other,&quot; he says. &quot;We had never met. If she had called me and said, &#39;Hello, Raul, this is Dolly Parton,&#39; I would have been, like, &#39;Oh sure.&#39; I was thrilled. She has to be one of the few living legends; I consider her one.&quot; <br><br>As luck would have it, Raul&#39;s session was scheduled for a time when he had agreed to watch his 8-month-old song, Dino, so Parton ended up babysitting while Raul sang. &quot;Bless her heart,&quot; Raul says, &quot;she was all over him. I thought, &#39;Wait a minute, when I was a kid, Dolly Parton never held me. Man, this kid&#39;s starting out <i>good</i>.&#39; I usually had some ugly aunt come over and scare the hell out of me.&quot; <br><br>Raul says Parton gave him few instructions about how to handle his part. &quot;She just said, &#39;Sing, honey, sing.&#39; I said, &#39;Okay.&#39;&quot; Such emphasis on spontaneity and performance, he says, is &quot;exactly the way records should be made. We did some parts of it live. She&#39;s such a great singer that her vocal is a scratch vocal. To this day, I&#39;m glad that somebody&#39;s still around that does that. These days, most people add the vocal after the record&#39;s recorded. They use harmonizers,&quot; he says, a device &quot;that take your out-of-tune note and puts it in tune.&quot; <br><br>&quot;We tried to be true to the songs,&quot; Parton says, but that didn&#39;t preclude her from extending some unexpected invitations. <i>Treasures</i> opens with its most surprising collaboration, a guest vocal by South African pop stars Ladysmith Black Mambazo, best known for their 1986 appearance on Paul Simon&#39;s <i>Graceland</i> album. &quot;When I wanted Ladysmith to sing,&quot; says Parton, &quot;I didn&#39;t know it was them. I was trying to figure out a sound that I wanted for this record, working with Steve Buckingham, who produced the album.&quot; One evening, when Parton was relaxing in front of the TV, she heard Ladysmith performing their resonant a cappella vocal on a Life Savers commercial, and she recognized in their quivering tremolo a similarity to her own. &quot;And I thought, &#39;Whoever it is, wherever they are, that&#39;s who I&#39;m having on this record.&#39; So I got up from the chair, and I called Steve. I said, &#39;I don&#39;t know who it is, but in the morning, you call and find out who&#39;s singing the Life Saver commercial.&#39; So he called, and sure enough, it was Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They&#39;ve got that same vibrato, that same emotion, that sadness, that little quivery thing. Back in the early days when I had even more vibrato, I had been taught through the years to try to control it, a little kid said to me, &#39;You sound like you&#39;ve been eating sheep, <i>baaaa</i>.&#39;&quot; <br><br>Ladysmith lends its voices to Parton&#39;s interpretation of Cat Stevens&#39; &quot;Peace Train,&quot; a statement partly inspired, she says, by the spectre of violent church burnings that have plagued the South this year. &quot;I just felt kinda inspired to sing it because of the spiritual need to do it. To try to bring people together, to try to love one another, to try to find some peace and comfort. All the war and the church burnings, people just can&#39;t get along. And it&#39;s like, what is our problem? Why can&#39;t we care about one another a little bit? It drives me crazy that people hate so bad in this world and don&#39;t even know why.&quot; Ladysmith leader Joseph Shabalala, Parton notes, is the minister of the church in his South African village. <br><br>The meeting of Ladysmith and Parton was quite an anticipated event for both parties. &quot;His little wife came,&quot; Parton says, &quot;and they had a couple of sons in the group, and he had a couple of brothers in the group. It was so family oriented, it was so sweet.&quot; Parton has completed a CBS television special on the making of <i>Treasures</i>, which features appearances by many of the guest artists, including Ladysmith. &quot;They&#39;re going to be there, dressed in their African outfits.&quot; The show airs on November 30, Saturday evening after Thanksgiving. <br><br>Another special, <i>High and Mighty</i>, featuring traditional gospel music, is in production for ABC, and &quot;I&#39;m gonna do some more movies,&quot; Parton promises. &quot;I still, of course, have an agent. It&#39;s just really hard to find something that I think I could do well. It&#39;s important to me to do a character that I can relate to. I couldn&#39;t handle a thing like Madonna on a movie like <i>Evita</i>. But there are characters I could play, that are close to my own personality. I think that I would do great playing the Mary Kay [the cosmetics mogul] story. I would love to do Ann Richards [the former Texas governor] if they ever do a story of her life. But I am going heavily into the acting with Movies of the Week now, through my production company. As a matter of fact, I&#39;m doing a Christmas Movie of the Week this year, it&#39;s called <i>Unlikely Angel</i>, and it&#39;ll be on the week before Christmas.&quot;<br><br>With so many different ventures in the works, another performer might run the risk of spreading herself too thing. Parton fights that tendency with a clear vision of her priorities. &quot;The music always means the most to me, because it was my music that brought me out of the Smoky Mountains, it brought me to Nashville, and from there to Hollywood and ultimately around the world. I think it was all born of the songs that I wrote.&quot; <br><br>She&#39;s quite proud of the success Whitney Houston has had with &quot;I Will Always Love You. &quot;When I heard that, even though it was so different, I thought, &#39;Ooooh, what a powerful thing.&#39; I never heard the song that way, and it was the biggest song in the whole wide world, ever. What a compliment. Who would have ever thought, that little old simple song could have done all that? I&#39;m very proud of her, I&#39;m very proud of the song, and I&#39;m very proud for me that I made all the money off of that little heartbreak. Because I wrote that song from a real heartache. That&#39;s when I left the <i>Porter Wagoner Show</i>, and he wouldn&#39;t listen to me, he wouldn&#39;t hear anything I had to say. He was so angry at me, he was furious. I couldn&#39;t get it out what I was doing. And I thought, &#39;well, why don&#39;t you write a song? That&#39;s what you do best anyway.&#39; And so I wrote a song to say to him, &#39;I hope life treats you kind, and I hope that you have all you ever dreamed of. I wish you joy and happiness, and above all this, I wish you love.&#39; <br><br>&quot;How many of us really can feel that way when the chips are down? That&#39;s why I loved the song &#39;For The Good Times.&#39; I thought it was the most adult song. You know, &#39;Yeah, well, boy, that&#39;s how I wish I could feel, but when I&#39;m hurt and saying goodbye, the last thing I want you to be is happy.&#39; We can all feel that way once the hurt is gone. Once you see that old lover later and he&#39;s fat and old and bald. You think, &#39;How could I ever have suffered like that over you?&#39; But we do, don&#39;t we?&quot; <br><br>With so many years of experience under her belt, these days Parton sometimes finds herself playing the big sister role to country&#39;s younger women, people like Krauss and Shania Twain, who cite her as a significant influence. &quot;A lot of them want to know about my management; a lot of them come to me for advice. I see my name a lot of times in articles, with some of the kids. It makes me feel old, but it makes me feel good. They talk about you like you&#39;re some legend that died maybe 30 years ago. But actually, I&#39;ve made really good friends with a lot of the young women.&quot; <br><br>Many writers have called 1996 the year of the women in country, but Parton knows these trends happen in cycles. After all, when she first came up in the &#39;70s, country music was experiencing a similar resurgence of female performers, as the careers of Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and, of course, Parton first bloomed. &quot;I&#39;m very proud of the young kids that are doing so well,&quot; Parton says, &quot;and they have a great respect and love for the old traditional artists. But as far as country radio, some of the deejays that used to be rock deejays, I call &#39;em born-again deejays &mdash; and some of these program directors, they won&#39;t play you if you&#39;re over 30. So all these wonderful singers like George Jones, Merle Haggard, Randy Travis, Ronnie Milsap can&#39;t get a record played. Even Willie, Waylon. It&#39;s ridiculous.&quot; <br><br>And so it&#39;s Parton hope that the familiar material on <i>Treasures</i> will earn her a break with radio programmers. Thirty-two years ago she came to Nashville dreaming of fame, and now she finds herself with a similar ambition: &quot;To have an audience, yeah. Or to keep an audience. Or to have a new audience. I want to be part of everything that&#39;s going on, that&#39;s mostly why I want to be played on country radio now. I want to be part of that thing. <br><br>&quot;I always try to feel like I&#39;m progressing along with life. That&#39;s the thing that bothers me the most. It&#39;s not about the money, I don&#39;t care about that. I just want the artistic, creative freedom to do it, and to be in that mainstream. I don&#39;t accept the fact that I&#39;m getting older. I don&#39;t feel a bit older now than I did when I first came to this town, in 1964, when I came here to live. I feel exactly the same way. I&#39;m just as hungry as I was then, I still love the music as much. I&#39;m in a position now to even do better. But I need that chance.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Ladie&#39;s Home Journal</font><br><font size="2">July 1995</font><br><br>DOLLY DISHES<br>About Her Nips &amp; Tucks, Feuds &amp; Flops And (Very, Very) Private Life</div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Ladie's Home Journal" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="Ladie's Home Journal" width="455"><br><br><div align="left"><br>When she recently appeared on <i>Late Show</i> to chat with host David Letterman and sing a recut version of &quot;Jolene&quot; from her upcoming album, Dolly Parton also used her segment to plug Jukebox Junction, the seven-acre fifties-motif addition to her theme park, Dollywood, in east Tennessee. Letterman, who delights in scrambling his guests&#39; agendas, headed Parton off at the pass. &quot;So,&quot; he asked with an impish grin, &quot;you have rides, too, like Space Mountain?&quot; <br><br>The imperturbable Parton thrust out the one piece of her franchise she never tires of promoting and shot back, &quot;Space Mountain? I got Twin Peaks.&quot; <br><br>As Parton powers into her fourth decade in show business, those proud &quot;peaks&quot; and campy zingers continue to resist erosion from the winds of nineties political correctness. But make no mistake: Behind her fastidiously groomed facade, the superstar is a proud, shrewd hard-edged business woman who knows what she wants and how to get it. Yet Parton seems driven not by a world-beating ego, but rather a practical knack for survival in an industry where the young devour their elders. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m competitive in the business world,&quot; she says, &quot;trying to beat my own records. I know my strengths and weaknesses, what I will and won&#39;t tolerate and sacrifice. I don&#39;t put up with as much bull as I used to, and I don&#39;t have to kiss nobody&#39;s ass to get along in this world.&quot; <br><br>And why should she? Parton&#39;s fabled journey has transformed a dirt-poor &quot;backwoods Barbie&quot; from east Tennessee into an eye-popping showbiz icon: Her success in music, film, song and book publishing, the theme park and ventures ranging from wigs and cosmetics to kids&#39; books have pushed the worth of &quot;Dolly, Inc.&quot; to a reported $100 million. <br><br>Yet by all appearances, she remains just Dolly. The day after her <i>Late Show</i> appearance, Parton relaxes in a suite at The Pierre Hotel, picking at a cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&egrave;e and berries. Forty-nine looks fabulous on her. Who else would dare wear a getup best described as Frederick&#39;s of Dollywood: A skintight bodysuit with a low-cut top and steep heels? <br><br>Parton&#39;s bubbly, informal style masks her inner steeliness. But clearly, that&#39;s what&#39;s helped her cope with recent career setbacks and frustrations like her proposed TV sitcom, which has been &quot;reincarnated&quot; several times. The problem: Parton decided the material wasn&#39;t quite right. Having endured a late-eighties variety show she once admitted &quot;sucked,&quot; she&#39;d rather hold out than settle for an iffy concept. <br><br>With a mixed Hollywood movie scorecard (<i>9 to 5</i> and <i>Steel Magnolias</i> were hits; <i>Rhinestone</i> and <i>Straight Talk</i> were bombs), Parton frankly says there are &quot;no big [film] offers.&quot; And as for her music, she has quit the grueling bus-tour grind of younger days, but because she is now considered Old Guard by country radio stations focusing on attracting young listeners, she &quot;can&#39;t get singles played on the radio. I keep thinking they&#39;re going to start playing me again. I&#39;m still a dreamer.&quot; <br><br>Or schemer: Parton displayed keen survival skills with &quot;Romeo,&quot; her 1993 single/video with then-hot Billy Ray Cyrus. &quot;I&#39;m commercial-minded. If I can&#39;t get my own hit, I&#39;m not too proud to hang onto somebody else&#39;s coattails.&quot; <br><br>Wielding cat-o&#39;-nine-tails was more like it when Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris teamed up for a sequel to <i>Trio</i>, their 1987 platinum treasure. What should have been a major event last fall backfired amid acrimonious bickering. <br><br>To hear Parton tell it, the sessions could have been titled &quot;The Three Tempers&quot;: Parton, who can nail a song &quot;just as good the first time as the hundredth&quot;; Harris, the &quot;sweet&quot; country purist who painstakingly researched material; and Ronstadt, the perfectionist diva who &quot;loves to live in the studio and works so slow, it drives me nuts. I wanted to get a cattle prod and say, &#39;Wake up, bitch, I got stuff to do.&#39;&quot; <br><br>True, she says, their glorious harmonies were &quot;like a creative, emotional orgasm.&quot; But the thrill was gone once Parton&#39;s ever-shifting schedule of business, sitcom and book projects left her unavailable to tour and help promote what would have been a fall release. She &quot;cried and begged&quot; her partners to delay release until this spring, when she promised to promote the record. &quot;They pitched a fit and dumped the greatest project ever. It was a sin and a shame, and a stupid decision, to give that album an abortion. It got into a power play. I was made to feel hurt, insulted, burdened with guilt. I would have lived up to my word, but my word wasn&#39;t good enough for them. Finally, I just said, &#39;The hell with it, sue me.&#39;&quot; <br><br>&quot;Linda never sounded bitter,&quot; an Elektra Records insider says cautiously. &quot;It seems like it&#39;s being made into too big of a drama.&quot; <br><br>Indeed, when Parton demanded her vocals be mixed out of the tracks so Ronstadt couldn&#39;t use them on another album, she settled financially. Did <i>Trio 2</i> also cost her in friendship? Parton offers a pouty shrug. &quot;We were never all that close, just girlfriends in the business.&quot; Then, picking up with more Dolly-like sass and animation: &quot;I realized we&#39;re now just a bunch of old crotchety, cranky women, set in our ways and getting up there &#39;round fifty, goin&#39; through change-of-life mood swings. You never know a true feeling from a hot flash. I thought, I don&#39;t need this. I ain&#39;t that old yet.&quot; <br><br>In general, Parton does not obsess about aging. She thrives on &quot;staying busy, making something happen. If I get bored, I get depressed.&quot; That seems unlikely, given her energy level and work ethic. When Parton arrived for a recent photo session forty-five minutes early, for instance, she grew impatient with the leisurely pace of the photographer and her crew. <br><br>She has business on both coasts, so she has an L.A. bungalow <i>and</i> a Fifth Avenue apartment, but she spends close to three quarters of her time in Nashville. And though Parton will forge on with the development of her sitcom, she is excited to finally have time to focus on the mammoth catalog of three thousand songs she&#39;s written. She&#39;ll make demo tapes and &quot;tailor&quot; her pop, gospel and country compositions so she can pitch to &quot;certain people&quot; to record her songs. After all, Whitney Houston&#39;s version of Parton&#39;s song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; was a record-setting No. 1 hit for fourteen weeks, dwarfing the success that Parton had with it. &quot;I make more money from publishing and songwriting than almost anything else I do,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ve never really even worked at it, never pitched a song myself. Now I&#39;m going to see how well I do if <i>I</i> push my stuff.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s one career regret is &quot;never being the consistent recording artist I dreamed of being&quot;, meaning, the sustained platinum-album sales of, say, Kenny Rogers, Houston or Elton John. But, if, as she agrees, spreading herself thin with film and other projects has &quot;absolutely&quot; compromised her in the record business, it has saved her in the piggy bank. <br><br>&quot;I have had a half-assed so-called crossover-pop career. But lots of [aging country] people now are starving to death. Most of them are what we call hick rich, get rich quick, spend it quick. Being broke and famous is a sad, hard place to be. Sure, I had a lot of irons in the fire, and it burned people&#39;s asses back then. Had I not done all these other things, <i>I&#39;d</i> be broke now.&quot; <br><br>She struck literary gold, too, with her best-selling memoir, <i>Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business</i>. The book, Parton admits, raised more questions than it answered about her reclusive husband of nearly thirty years, Carl Dean, and lifelong confidante Judy Ogle, who was in the adjoining bedroom at The Pierre and who shadows Parton on the road as a constant companion. <br><br>In <i>Dolly</i>, Parton described Dean as loyal and loving but &quot;not strong when it comes to my having problems&quot;; she related often sharing a bed with Ogle (&quot;Why scream across the room when you don&#39;t have to?&quot;) and a bond &quot;closer than husband and wife.&quot; <br><br>Such titillation, she says, was &quot;deliberate. I can&#39;t tell everything about me without hurting someone else. I prayed that I could satisfy people&#39;s curiosity in a kind, Christian manner. But I should have called it <i>My Life and It&#39;s Nobody&#39;s Business</i>. Hell, they only paid what, twelve dollars, at bargain prices?&quot; (They&#39;ll pay even less for the paperback version, released last month.) <br><br>Bottom line on Dean: &quot;What I meant to [write] is, I loved him too much to put him through a lot of the stuff I brought on myself. I share what I want to with Carl, and he knows the rest. Our relationship is like mine and Judy&#39;s. It is pure, it is sacred and it is real.&quot; <br><br>As for Ogle: &quot;We&#39;ve never been lovers, nor will we ever be lovers. Judy&#39;s never been married. She&#39;s an old maid [laughing]. She&#39;d probably rather be called a lesbian than an old maid. I don&#39;t care who she sleeps with or when she sleeps with them.&quot; <br><br>Parton needed all the help she could get from both Dean and Ogle during a medical crisis in the early eighties, ultimately undergoing &quot;female surgery&quot; to stem internal hemorrhaging. (&quot;I had a couple of D&amp;C&#39;s to control [bleeding]. I was all nerves. I even started to drink to ease my pain,&quot; she wrote.) Parton also had her &quot;tubes tied&quot; so she could go off birth control pills. It was a time of career stress, not to mention personal woes: There was turbulence and &quot;betrayal&quot; within her inner circle (she believed confidants were leaking stories to the press), in addition to a fifty-pound weight gain followed by drastic weight loss (&quot;I was a hog, but then I got too skinny&quot;) and depression. Her decision not to have children triggered reactions in loved ones (not Dean) that only added to her anguish: &quot;I was feeling guilty about not having kids, about having a career, that I&#39;m not the woman I should be because I don&#39;t have a desire to have them, that I was selfish.&quot; <br><br>Parton&#39;s greatest gift, perhaps, is turning such hardships into song. &quot;I cry, I pray, I kick, I piss and moan and cuss and write and sing my songs and it goes away. I almost feel God puts me through heartaches so I will have more to write about. I don&#39;t need a psychiatrist. I blurt out everything that I feel.&quot; <br><br>And after trying &quot;every crazy diet,&quot; she has finally made a comfortable, lasting peace with food and her body image. Parton maintains her figure by simply controlling what she eats with light but constant snacks, and cosmetic nips and tucks for good measure. She makes no apologies for liposuction (&quot;If you got those little [hip] pouches that no amount of exercise or diet&#39;s gonna get, well, you just go in for a sucking&quot;); breast enhancements (&quot;I had them little soldiers lifted to attention so I don&#39;t have to wear a bra&quot;); or tiny tucks under the chin or eyes (&quot;If it makes you feel your best self, and as long as you don&#39;t get your plastic surgeon from the Yellow Pages, what&#39;s wrong with it?&quot;). <br><br>Parton&#39;s built herself a dream house as well as a dream body. Her home, situated on seventy-five acres, is a few miles from Music Row in Brentwood, a Nashville suburb. And though the house was once surrounded by lush farmland when she and Dean settled there in the seventies, Parton likes that it&#39;s now highly developed, with a mall only minutes away. She loves hiking on local trails and playing with her three Nashville-area sisters&#39; kids in their treehouses. She and Dean can fish and picnic at their cabin and houseboat on Old Hickory Lake a half hour away. Dean, fifty-two, who&#39;s retired from his asphalt paving business, buys, improves and sells properties. Parton loves dining out, but Elvis is about as likely to be sighted in town as Dean. &quot;Oh, I get him out once in a while, but he don&#39;t like to get cleaned up in a suit and tie that much.&quot; <br><br>Fortunately, Dean tinkers on farm equipment in the barn, leaving Parton free to channel-surf from Court TV to CNN for her daily O.J. trial fix. Two recent high points, she says, were pulling alongside prosecutor Marcia Clark in L.A. freeway traffic, then spotting F. Lee Bailey dining at Mortons. &quot;I told him, &#39;I&#39;m trying to get a TV show off the ground, be you&#39;re having a lot more luck than me. I wish to God I had your ratings.&#39; The trial&#39;s just the dangedest thing.&quot;<br><br>Not really. The &quot;dangedest thing&quot; may just be growing up with twelve kids in a two-room mountain shack with no plumbing, using corncobs for dolls and newspaper on the walls for insulation, and becoming Dolly Parton. Small wonder after three decades that it&#39;s an identity she&#39;s not likely to surrender. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be this way when I&#39;m eighty, like Mae West,&quot; she boasts. &quot;I may be on crutches, in a wheelchair or propped up on some old slantboard, but I&#39;ll have my high heels, my nails and makeup on, my hair&#39;ll be all poufed up and my boob&#39;ll still be hangin&#39; out. It&#39;s not a big job being Dolly. It&#39;s just my life.&quot;</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">Country Weekly</font><br><font size="2">August 29, 1995</font><br><br>Dolly&#39;s Turning 50...

She&#39;ll turn 50 in January, but clearly, country&#39;s dynamo hasn&#39;t slowed down by even one platinum blond hair.<br><br> This gorgeous whirlwind wears out, and looks better than, those half her age, putting in staggering hours to create her music and keep her business empire thriving. Just look at what she&#39;s doing: <br><br><ul><li>She releases her latest album, <i>Something Special</i>, this week. The album includes her first batch of new songs in almost three years and new versions of her all-time favorites, including a duet of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; with Vince Gill.</li></ul><ul><li>She&#39;s expanding her successful Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., for the second time in two years. She&#39;s spending $8 million on the new Dollywood Boulevard attraction, which will open next April to salute movie star glamour.</li></ul><ul><li>Her pen didn&#39;t stop writing after last year&#39;s best-selling autobiography, <i>Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business</i>. A sequel will tell &quot;the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&quot;</li></ul><ul><li>She&#39;s working on a second children&#39;s book. Her first, <i>Coat Of Many Colors</i>, illustrated the story behind one of Dolly&#39;s most popular songs.</li></ul><ul><li>She&#39;s opening more Dixie Stampede dining and entertainment arenas, the third recently premiered this summer in Branson, Mo. The Dixie Stampedes offer their patrons a meal and an equestrian show. She&#39;s working on taking the concept nationwide.</li></ul><ul><li>She&#39;s already hard at work on a new TV show, after the one previously planned, <i>Heavens To Betsy</i>, fell through.</li></ul><ul><li>She&#39;s capitalizing on her voluptuous-yet-fit physique by coming out with new lines of products, food favorites and a line of lingerie.</li></ul><br><br> Where does she get the energy for all this?<br>&quot;I think most of it comes from being excited about what I do,&quot; Dolly told COUNTRY WEEKLY. &quot;I love what I do and I think energy creates energy. I think the key is to do something you love. I think you just get naturally energized by that. I think I&#39;ve always had a lot of energy. I&#39;m almost hyper to some degree. Of course, it&#39;s always good to eat good, sleep good and exercise if you can, but I have to admit I&#39;m not all that good on any of that. I eat most of the wrong things and I eat them too often, but I try to eat small meals and snack through the day to keep my energy up. And I think I sleep enough for my personality,&quot; said the always-upbeat singer.<br>She even works when most of us are asleep: Dolly&#39;s most productive hours, she said, are from 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. <br><br>The latest example of that energy is <i>Something Special</i>.<br>&quot;The reason I called the album <i>Something Special</i> was I had written a lot of new songs that I felt were very personal and emotional, and I felt they were special,&quot; Dolly said. &quot;When you write songs, it&#39;s so much like parents having kids. You think they&#39;re all special. Another reason I though it was special was because I chose to do three of my all-time favorite songs that I have written through the years. I included &#39;Jolene,&#39; which has always been a personal favorite of mine. It was out 22 years ago and I felt it was time to redo it because a lot of people hadn&#39;t heard it, although I was kind of famous for it. <br><br>&quot;One of the things that made this album really special is I did &#39;I Will Always Love You&#39; as a duet for the first time with none other than Vince Gill. I recorded it twice myself and it was the first time the same song has been number one by the same artist. The first time was in the early &#39;70s when I left Porter Wagoner&#39;s show, which is basically why I wrote it. I wrote it for Porter as a goodbye song. Then I recorded it again on <i>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</i> movie.<br>&quot;Of course, Whitney Houston had the worldwide major hit with it. She made us a few bucks on that so I could buy some cheap wigs and jewelry,&quot; Dolly said with her girlish giggle. &quot;Now it makes a perfect duet, two people parting ways and wishing each other well. He did such a beautiful job and I was so honored that he even wanted to sing it,&quot; Dolly said.<br>&quot;I also included &#39;The Seeker.&#39; I wrote it at a time when I was going through a lot of personal things and reaching out to God. It&#39;s a nice message for today.&quot;<br>She built another favorite, &quot;Coat of Many Colors,&quot; into her children&#39;s book. &quot;People love the song because it talks about principals, values and family values. They came to me about putting that out and it was actually one of the biggest-selling children&#39;s books of last year. I&#39;ve always loved to do children&#39;s things. I actually have real children&#39;s stories and songs that I have written. Children relate to me a lot because of my name, my little voice and my over-exaggerated look, like a Mother Goose character, and I hope one day I will be able to do videos, books and children&#39;s specials.&quot; <br><br>After her first autobiography spent four months on best-seller lists, you can count on seeing another. &quot;I called it <i>My Life and Other Unfinished Business</i>, so I can write another one that tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God.&quot; <br><br>The sequel could certainly include a chapter on her thriving businesses, such as Dixie Stampede. Others will follow: Look soon for Dixie Fixins, a line of foods, and lingerie called Dailies and Nighties. <br><br>Success on television has eluded her, but she&#39;s working in it. <i>Heavens To Betsy</i>, a television series that would have starred Dolly, fell through this summer. &quot;I&#39;m still hoping to have a hit show one of these days,&quot; she insisted. &quot;We&#39;re trying to get something that&#39;s uplifting, fun and exciting. I think I&#39;m going to enjoy doing television once I ever get the right thing.&quot; <br><br>And then there&#39;s Dollywood, which she opened in 1986. &quot;I have to say I&#39;m as proud of Dollywood as anything I&#39;ve ever done in my entire life. It&#39;s a wonderful place to go and a wonderful legacy to leave behind for my family. I&#39;m also proud of the Dollywood Foundation, which provides education and medical needs for a lot of the kids in the area. It makes me feel good to take something back home and be part of something that my family can be proud of.&quot; <br><br>She plans to keep building that legacy well beyond her 50th birthday. &quot;I don&#39;t ever want to retire,&quot; she said adamantly. &quot;I was off from work several years ago with some health problems and I realized during that time that there&#39;s no way I would ever retire, because I love what I do. I&#39;m sure there will be times I&#39;ll relax a little more, but this is my job, this is my joy and I&#39;m relaxed when I can pretty much do what I want to. I figure we&#39;ll be dead for a long time, so I&#39;m going to try to live for as long as I can. That&#39;s my motto.&quot; </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">TV Guide</font><br><font size="2">November 27 - December 3, 1993</font><br><br>Good Golly, Miss Dolly!</div><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="TV Guide" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="TV Guide" width="455"></div><br><br><i> </i>It&#39;s 9 A.M. and Dolly Parton is wearing a bouffant blond wig, a skin-tight jogging suit, and a pair of four-inch red spike heels a la Frederick&#39;s of Hollywood. Her face is in full makeup armor, her fingers lethally tipped with pink dragon-lady nails. She sits in the living room of her Los Angeles home (which has a decor to match its owner - outrageously feminine) and talks about her upcoming entry into the high-stakes world of infomercials: Dolly Parton&#39;s Beauty Confidence Collection, a cosmetics line created for her by Revlon. <br><br>Tomorrow Parton goes back into the studio to retool the infomercial, she confides now that she is disappointed with her performance. &quot;At one point I looked away from the camera, and it seemed as if I was reading off a TelePrompTer instead of saying it from my heart,&quot; she says. &quot;Everyone else thought it was fine, but I thought it looked crummy. If I did, so will my audience.&quot; <br><br>Still, she is excited about the project, which debuts in January. With a fee rumored to be close to $2 million, plus a hefty share of the gross, hers will be one of the biggest advertising deals the infomercial world has ever seen. <br><br>But then, Parton has always had a shrewd eye for a deal. Her $6 million investment in a Tennessee theme park, Dollywood, brings in $30 million a year. She has released more than 60 albums, with four Grammy wins. Of the 3,000 songs or so that she&#39;s composed, one of her earliest - &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; - was re-recorded by Whitney Houston for &quot;The Bodyguard,&quot; and has brought Parton an unexpected windfall. <br><br>But not everything Parton touches has turned to gold. In 1987, she ventured into the world of series television with a variety show for ABC - and flopped. Though she bristles at the concept of a TV &quot;comeback,&quot; that&#39;s exactly what she&#39;s outlined for herself in the coming months. The infomercial is just the first stage in a plan highlighted by an exclusive deal with Disney that includes a new pilot and several movies-of-the-week. &quot;But I&#39;m gonna be careful this time. You know, there was talk about my being offered the late-night show they gave Chevy Chase, but I&#39;m not smart enough for that job. You should be educated, and I&#39;m not. I know my own limitations.&quot; <br><br><b>TVG: </b>What made you decide to team up with Revlon for a line of cosmetics? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I always played with makeup, all my life. Even back home. I used the ol&#39; wild mountain berries and all the stains and things on my lips and cheeks. For lipstick I used wet crepe paper. I&#39;ve used every makeup that&#39;s ever been on the market. If somebody at a makeup counter told me it was gonna make me gorgeous, I bought it. So I decided I should take the best of everything and start my own line of makeup. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Do you think women in America want to look like you? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I&#39;m not tryin&#39; to preach that people should look like me, &#39;cause everybody don&#39;t want the dragon nails and town-tramp look. I always wore too much makeup &#39;cause I really did pattern myself after the town-tramp. When I was little, I thought she was the prettiest thing I&#39;d ever seen. She always wore bright red nails and toenail polish and makeup. So I just couldn&#39;t wait to get my hands on it. From the time I could scrape up enough money, I would buy a bottle of bleach. I did it &#39;cause it made me feel prettier. And Grandpa would have a fit. He would say, &quot;The devil has got into that young&#39;un.&quot; <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Did you ever get beaten because of makeup? <br><br><b>DP:</b> My granddaddy believe that wearin&#39; makeup was a sin. I used to get in all kinds of trouble. But we got our butts busted for lots of things. I went through hell to look the way I wanted to. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Are you ever self-conscious about your body? <br><br><b>DP:</b> When I was young, I used to have a beautiful body, but then I got fat. I didn&#39;t start to gain weight till I was rich and famous and started eatin&#39; and eatin&#39;. I&#39;m a hog anyway, but I started cookin&#39; on the bus, travelin&#39; around, makin&#39; nachos in the microwave, and just stoppin&#39; at every truck stop. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> There&#39;s been a dramatic change in your body since then. <br><br><b>DP:</b> I fasted. I did every diet - Atkins, Scarsdael, Optifast. I did all that stuff. Hoo! Believe me, I&#39;ve done everything. It took me three years. I was just a hog. And I still am. I love to eat. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Did you ever get dangerously thin? <br><br><b>DP:</b> No, I was never - what&#39;s that word? - anorexic. Hogs don&#39;t get anorexic. [<i>She laughs.</i>] But I lost about 50 pounds over a period of three years. I was just starving and fasting because I knew I had to get down to a stack of bones in order to start gaining back properly. For a long time I looked like a walkin&#39; skeleton. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> How low were you at your lowest weight? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Ninety pounds. I looked gaunt in the face. And I hated that look. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> What kind of emotions did those diets produce in you? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Oh, they make you hateful, PMS ain&#39;t nothin&#39; compared to going on a diet. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> What finally stopped you from losing weight? <br><br><b>DP:</b> When my momma and my husband, Carl Dean, told me I was too skinny. Now I eat everything I like. I just eat small portions. I have to try to keep a lid on it, &#39;cause I could probably be Raymond Burr if I don&#39;t watch it. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> You did a variety series, Dolly, right around the time when you lost all that weight, and it was canceled after one season. That must have been a big blow. <br><br><b>DP:</b> Well, it hurt my feelings - hurt my pride - more than it hurt my career. Even though it was canceled, it turned out to be a huge success for me financially. Three months into the show, I knew it wasn&#39;t going to work and I knew I didn&#39;t want it to. I wanted to do a country-music show, a more simple kind of show. Everybody was tryin&#39; to re-create those old variety shows. I&#39;m no Ed Sullivan. I&#39;m a country girl. So nobody would listen to me. I just didn&#39;t fight hard enough. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> You&#39;ve said that you are almost obsessed with looking beautiful. The tabloids have reported that one reason you do look beautiful is plastic surgery. <br><br><b>DP:</b> [<i>Irritated</i>] I don&#39;t appreciate people asking me about that. But I&#39;m going to try and be honest. I&#39;ve had nips and tucks. And I would advise people if they are going to do it: Find the best doctors. So many people can get maimed and screwed up. For instance, I have a bad tendency to scar, so I have to be very careful any time I get anything done. But I&#39;ve never had anything drastic done. I&#39;d rather have it done every two years than wait too long, when all of a sudden everybody knows you&#39;ve had a face lift. And you look so tight, like a banjo head! I am not delighted to be discussing this. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> After you had made the transition from country music to films, with &quot;Nine To Five&quot; and &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas,&quot; you became ill. <br><br><b>DP:</b> I started havin&#39; some female problems, and my hormones went haywire. I went through a real hard time. I didn&#39;t feel good about myself and I didn&#39;t look good. And I was really depressed. I went through hell. I was pretty much out of commission for about 18 months. Now I understand how people get on drugs...how people become alcoholics. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Did you take any drugs? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I was takin&#39; medication and stuff. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Prozac? <br><br><b>DP:</b> No. It wasn&#39;t that kind of thing. I had a broken heart. I won&#39;t elaborate. I&#39;ll just say that it was people very close to me, whether it be male or female. It was one of those situations where I understood completely how people get themselves into the shapes they get in to commit suicide. And after that I was never the same. The greatest heartache was feeling betrayed by people I had been very involved with in business.<br><br><b>TVG:</b> In Hollywood? <br><br><b>DP:</b> No. Very personal Dolly business. I was burned by people very near and dear in my own company. People I thought truly loved me and were loyal. <br><b>TVG:</b> How did you turn the corner? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Well, there were just so many bad moments that lasted over a long period of time. I was so self-pitying. Then I had female surgery and I couldn&#39;t get up and I knew I would never be able to have children. I was guilt-ridden, and some people tried to make me feel worse. I&#39;d always had faith in God, and then, all of a sudden I was really mad at God, really mad. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Were you suicidal? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Every day I thought, &quot;I just wish I had the nerve to kill myself.&quot; I wanted some good dope, or some good drugs so I could just go out in peace, or find Dr. Kevorkian. I really wanted to be able to do it. But then I realized I didn&#39;t have the guts. I was just dying slow. I asked God for some answers. I said, &quot;Look, either you&#39;re gonna help me or I&#39;m jus&#39; gonna kill myself and it&#39;s gonna be your fault.&quot; And the answer just kinda came to me with the voice of God himself: &quot;Get off your fat butt and get on with life. Or go ahead and blow your brains out.&quot; So I got up and started doing more positive things. I&#39;m writing a book that will be out next fall [<i>Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business</i>, for Harper Collins], and I talk about all these things. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> You&#39;ve said how supportive your husband was at that time. You&#39;ve also had the support of your best friend, Judy Ogle. Are you disturbed by the published rumors about your relationship with her? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Judy and I have been friends since we were 7. We have done everything together - but not <i>that</i>. I&#39;ve often said I am closer to Judy than I am to Carl, and it&#39;s true. But what would be the big deal if the rumors were true? There are a lot of gay people in the world! I&#39;m just no one of &#39;em. Why is it they have to dirty every beautiful thing? <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Some press accounts say you have been married for 27 years, but that you&#39;ve spent a total of six months with the man you are married to. Is that true? <br><br><b>DP:</b> That&#39;s bull! And it&#39;s cruel. I love everything about Carl. I love his decency, his honesty. He is the only person in the world who can wake me up out of a dead sleep and make me laugh. But he&#39;d die before he&#39;d do an interview. He does not like it when the tabloids hide in a ditch and wait to get a picture of him. He came on location with me to &quot;Steel Magnolias,&quot; and he came on &quot;Nine to Five.&quot; <br><br><b>TVG:</b> How did the other stars react to him on the set? <br><br><b>DP:</b> He is very good-looking and very magnetic and women are really taken with him. I was sitting with Jane Fonda, talking about the kind of men we think are good-looking. So we look across the stage and there&#39;s Carl. And Jane says: &quot;Now that&#39;s my kinda man.&quot; She looks at me and says: &quot;I saw him first!&quot; A few minutes later she kinda sidles over and she finds out it&#39;s Carl, my husband. She was so embarrassed. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Is your relationship with Carl Dean an open one? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I have many wonderful relationships with men and women that are love affairs of a sort. I mean, sex and love are two different things. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> If you ever had an affair, would you tell Carl? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Well, of course I wouldn&#39;t tell him! And I wouldn&#39;t want him to tell me if he had an affair. Now that would be stupid. I wouldn&#39;t tell him, and I wouldn&#39;t tell you, either. So don&#39;t ask! <br><br><b>TVG:</b> Where do you get your ambition? What was it about life in the Tennessee hills that you didn&#39;t want? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I just wanted to stay back there, get married, have a house full of kids, let my teeth rot out, and have no clothes and nothin&#39;. But it wasn&#39;t about what I <i>didn&#39;t</i> want - it was about what I <i>did</i> want. And what I <i>needed</i>. I needed the attention. Momma and Daddy loved us, but they didn&#39;t have time for us unless we were sick or in trouble. The only time we really got picked up was when we were being nursed or when we were gonna get our butts popped. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> What was it like growing up in a cabin in the Tennessee mountains with 12 kids and no bathroom? <br><br><b>DP:</b> We had runnin&#39; water when we&#39;d run and git it. We basically all slept in the same bed - three, four in the same bed, most like army cots. It wasn&#39;t so bad &#39;cept everybody peed in the bed. You know, when I went to Nashville to become a star, I was so homesick I said, it&#39;s amazin&#39;, how you miss stuff. Like pee! <br><br><b>TVG:</b> So now you are a superstar and your husband is in the home-building and asphalt-paving businesses. Have you ever felt like moving on from him? <br><br><b>DP:</b> Never! Carl and I will be together until one of us dies. See, Carl gives me what no one else can: the freedom to work. My husband is happy to let me fly. He&#39;s happy to let me be married and single at the same time. And he don&#39;t want me in his face all the time. He is not jealous or competitive. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> What did he say when people said you and Burt Reynolds were having a romance when you made &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas&quot;? <br><br><b>DP:</b> One day at home I was playing with our little dog, this little Boston terrier bulldog that we love. I&#39;d wrapped him in a blanket and was carryin&#39; him around. And I was a-rockin&#39; him and playing and Carl grabbed the camera. He took a picture of me with this little ugly dog and he said, &quot;Here. I want you to send this to the <i>National Enquirer</i> and tell &#39;em that this is a picture of your and Burt&#39;s baby.&quot; <br><br><b>TVG:</b> You had a very stormy relationship with your former singing partner, Porter Wagoner. I know you&#39;ve made up with him, but he sued you for breach of contract and won $1 million. Why? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I was trying to leave his show and he wouldn&#39;t hear of it. He was just choking me to death. I told him, &quot;I&#39;m just starting out. I want to be able to grow.&quot; I started with him when I was 21 years old. We had a fiery, passionate relationship. My husband and I don&#39;t even fight like that. We used to have knockdown drag-outs. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> It sounds pretty intense. <br><br><b>DP:</b> You get in these love-hate relationships with the people that you work with. Porter and I were very competitive and passionate. Then you&#39;d get all jealous, too. And I am not ashamed of feeling this way. But finally, it was just breaking my heart because I thought, well, I&#39;m going. He won&#39;t listen. There&#39;s nothing I can say that will make it easier. So I just sat down and wrote this song. [<i>She leans forward, and tears come into her eyes</i>.] &quot;If I should stay,/I would only be in your way,/and so I&#39;ll go,/but I know I&#39;ll think of you each step of the way,/and I will always love you.&quot; And now I&#39;m in tears! <br><br><b>TVG:</b> What about your music? You&#39;ve been on the road for 10 months, and you have a new album, <i>Honky Tonk Angel</i>, with Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette. Is music still important? <br><br><b>DP:</b> I consider myself country music&#39;s goodwill ambassador. But I can&#39;t get a record played on the radio right now! An&#39; neither can anybody else over 35 years old. We&#39;re considered old country. I understand progress, but I think they should mix &#39;n&#39; match.<br><br><b>TVG:</b> I understand you are ready to shoot a pilot for a new sitcom for Disney. <br><br><b>DP:</b> This is a show within a show, where I play the host of a cookin&#39; show. And I can have guests stars who bring on their favorite recipies. Maybe there will be voice-over songs. Maybe the character doesn&#39;t sing, but her feelings and thoughts could. I think I could get it right this time and have a hit show. <br><br><b>TVG:</b> A friend said you&#39;re one of the smartest and most perceptive women he knows, but that you camouflage it - I presume by the way you look, with your wig and four-inch heels and makeup. <br><br><b>DP:</b> It&#39;s a nice compliment, but I ain&#39;t all that smart, to be honest. I&#39;m just smart about what I know. I&#39;m a very professional Dolly Parton.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><div align="center"><font face="Times" size="5">McCalls</font><br><font size="2">May 1992</font><br><br>What Dolly Wants Now!<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="McCalls" height="1" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/eNUNHgGzxsToXi2TnsXBng7992/GW455H1" title="McCalls" width="455"></div><br><div align="left"><br>She&#39;s known enough heartbreak to write a dozen country/western songs, yet she still considers her life &quot;a Cinderella story&quot; come true.<br><br> Let&#39;s get this straight, right at the outset: The most substantial thing about Dolly Parton is not her breasts. Nevertheless, her breasts <i>are</i> the most obvious symbol of an essential fact about the woman: She&#39;s a tiny person who thinks very big. You know the moment you meet her that you&#39;re in the presence of an extraordinarily strong and powerful woman, but also a very softhearted and feminine one. And in an odd way, although Dolly is strikingly attractive, even beautiful, her body comes across less as sexy than as wholesome, friendly, playful. Her parents knew what they were doing, alright, when they named her Dolly. <br> <br>We meet up in Hollywood, where she&#39;s just completed work on her latest movie, <i>Straight Talk</i>, with James Woods. She&#39;s also writing songs, touring with her band, producing movies and keeping an eye, as always, on the Dollywood theme park she opened six years ago in Tennessee to honor her Smoky Mountain roots. This is one busy woman.<br>It&#39;s been close to ten years since the last time I talked to Parton, whose independence and unquenchable spirit (not to mention that heartbreaking voice) have made her one of my favorite women in the world, and she&#39;s looking good. Better, actually, than ever. She seems, finally, to have transcended emotional turbulence of the last few years, which included a brief, unsuccessful attempt at a network variety show a couple of season back and, before then, some major health problems that she&#39;s described, with uncharacteristic vagueness, as involving &quot;female problems, family problems and heartbreak.&quot; She&#39;d put on a good deal of weight for a while there, but after years of going up and down the scale, she&#39;s been holding steady at a trim 110 pounds.<br>As I turn on my tape recorder, I ask Parton if she&#39;d say hello to my children, who are big fans of hers. &quot;Hi, Charlie, hi, Willy, hi, Audrey!&quot; she says. &quot;This is Dolly Parton.&quot; On a roll now, I ask if she&#39;d tell them to please be good and always do exactly what I tell them.<br><div align="left">&quot;I don&#39;t do anything my mama tells me,&quot; Parton says, with her trademark, almost musical, giggle. &quot;You just be who you are and treat your mama the best you can. Be good to your mama, though. Always be good to your mama.&quot;</div><br> You can&#39;t spend much time with Dolly Parton and not talk about family. The fourth of the 12 children of Robert and Avie Lee Parton, she grew up in a tiny cabin without running water or electricity in the hills of impoverished eastern Tennessee. Parton&#39;s songs are full of stories about the old days (hard times, but plenty of love). But as nostalgic as she is about those early times, Parton never intended to live out her days in Sevier County.<br>&quot;I certainly loved my mother and my aunts and sisters and all those people up there,&quot; she says. &quot;But I never had any intention of being like them when I grew up, living by those kind of rules. I never planned on staying home with kids, devoted to one man. And when I first started getting attention by being able to sing and play the guitar and people started responding, well, it was like I fell in love.&quot; Her uncle, Bill Owens, brought her to Nashville when she was ten years old to sing on the radio, and from the first, she says matter-of-factly, &quot;I knew that was what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I always knew I was going to be something special.&quot;<br>If someone else were saying this, it might come across as pompous. But when this particular woman sits in her manager&#39;s Grammy-filled Hollywood office in her skintight pants and low-cut sweater and tells you she&#39;s always &quot;felt led by God to sing,&quot; all you can do is nod. If angels have voices, it&#39;s hard to imagine them sounding any prettier than Dolly Parton&#39;s. &quot;I just kept walking toward that light,&quot; Parton explains.<br>I point out that Parton must have been very different from other children, which surely carried its own burden. She nods emphatically. &quot;That&#39;s very true,&quot; she says. &quot;I was just always this very alive, very high-burning, very passionate child. Life can be very painful to a person like that, but pain is part of the creative process. And pain is part of growing up, too. It makes you strong and keeps you vulnerable. It keeps you growing. I&#39;ve been through a lot and guess I chose to go through a lot, but I&#39;ve often said I&#39;d never harden my heart, and I never have. My heart is very tender. I just have strong muscles around it.&quot;<br>Cinderella was her role model (not that she ever say the Disney version). &quot;If someone could be a pumpkin one minute and a fairy princess the next,&quot; she says, &quot;you had to figure there was magic in the world.&quot; Parton believed in what she called &quot;my own personal magic&quot; too. She read the Bible but, ignoring the fire-and-brimstone stuff, concentrated on such phrases as, &quot;Through God all things are possible....&quot;<br>Perhaps because her Cinderella book bore no illustrations, she found the model for her future look closer to home. &quot;There was this tramp that lived in our town,&quot; she remembers. &quot;I better not say her name, &#39;cause she&#39;s probably got kids and grandkids now. But back then, she wore these bright-colored clothes and she had this peroxide yellow hair, yellow, not blonde, and she used to walk up and down the streets of our hometown and they always said, &#39;Oh, she&#39;s just trash, she&#39;s just a whore.&#39; But I thought she was beautiful.&quot;<br>And was she really a prostitute, I ask? Parton considers this for a moment. &quot;She didn&#39;t do it for money, I figure. She did it for fun. If she got paid for it, she would&#39;ve bought a better grade of bleach. But her clothes fit real tight and she looked real good in them, and so as soon as I got to where I could start wearing my clothes skintight, I did. It went against our religion, and I got whipped for it, but I did it anyway.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve always been flamboyant, and I&#39;ve always believed in having fun,&quot; Parton adds thoughtfully. But, she says firmly, &quot;I also believe the God I love and know <i>meant</i> me to have fun and enjoy life. That was how I was then, and that&#39;s the way I am now.&quot;<br>There might seem to be two contradictory sides to Dolly Parton: On the one hand, she&#39;s the down-home country girl who sings gospel songs and reads the Scriptures and built a chapel on her property, the woman who loves to sit around with her brothers and sisters and their kids singing old Appalachian tunes. That Parton is about as natural as they come. But then there&#39;s the star, the bleach blonde in the 4-inch heels and the rhinestone-studded, formfitting gowns. And <i>that</i> Parton is about as natural as the Las Vegas skyline.<br>All of which she cheerfully admits. &quot;Sure I look like a cartoon,&quot; Parton says. &quot;But you know, it started out very honest and sincere, and it still is, basically. I don&#39;t mean to look trashy and whore-y, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t think I do. And even if I do look like a whore, I sure don&#39;t feel like one. I just can&#39;t stand to look plain, &#39;cause that don&#39;t fit my personality. I may be a very artificial-looking person,&quot; Parton continues, &quot;but the good news is, I&#39;m very real on the inside. All the rest&quot;, she gestures at her outfit, her hair, her jewelry, &quot;is just like dressing up in your mama&#39;s clothes and playing with paints. It makes me feel shiny and sparkly and new. It just makes me want to get out and do things.&quot;<br>In her new movie, <i>Straight Talk</i>, Parton plays a woman whose story and character bear a striking resemblance to her own: &quot;She&#39;s a small-town girl from Arkansas, working as a dance teacher, but she&#39;s always wanted more.&quot; Parton&#39;s character heads for Chicago and, almost by accident, becomes a hugely successful radio talk-show host.<br>&quot;It&#39;s like the old Dolly versus the new Dolly,&quot; Parton says. But the truth is, she adds, they&#39;re one and the same. &quot;I just look a little different, and I&#39;m a little older, a little more worn, a little more sharpened, that&#39;s all. But I still stay close to home, close to family, close to my true values and morals, such as they are.&quot; <br><br>As soon as she finished high school, Parton boarded a bus for Nashville, just like so many women in the songs she&#39;s written, with the plan of becoming a star. &quot;Sure I was scared,&quot; she admits. &quot;But my desire to do things and know what&#39;s out there has always been greater than my fear. I was more scared of staying home than I was of leaving it.&quot;<br>During her first day in the big city, while walking out of a launderette, she met a man named Carl Dean, &quot;one of those love-at-first-sight kind of things&quot;, whom she married two years later. &quot;&#39;I know this will sound funny to you,&#39; I told him, &#39;but trust me, I&#39;m going to be a star.&#39;&quot;<br>Parton says she didn&#39;t hesitate to lay out her particular domestic ground rules right from the beginning. &quot;I love to cook, but I&#39;m gonna make enough money for somebody else to cook,&quot; she told Dean. &quot;It&#39;s not gonna be my duty and it&#39;s not gonna be my job and I damn sure ain&#39;t gonna clean house and I&#39;m not washing no dishes because I&#39;m not ruining my fingernails. I&#39;m gonna write songs and I&#39;m gonna sing. I may be a good woman, but I&#39;ll be gone most of the time, and I am certainly not gonna be your average housewife.&quot;<br>So Dean understood, right from the start, that Parton wasn&#39;t going to be around to cook his eggs for breakfast? &quot;He don&#39;t like eggs,&quot; she says flatly. &quot;He knew exactly what he was getting into.&quot;<br>They&#39;ve been married 25 years now, but if you add up the total number of days they&#39;ve spent together, well, Parton once jokingly figured it at somewhere around six months. That, coupled with Parton&#39;s open acknowledgment of attraction to other men and even references to &quot;lovers&quot; over the years, has led to plenty of speculation about her faithfulness. She calls herself the queen of the tabloids, but she won&#39;t come right out and admit, or deny, anything they print about her. &quot;It could be worse,&quot; she giggles. &quot;They could tell the truth about me.&quot;<br>I can&#39;t think of anyone quicker than Parton with a funny one-liner. But there&#39;s no mistaking her sincerity when she speaks seriously either. &quot;Listen,&quot; she says, &quot;my husband is not the type to hang onto my skirttail, trying to pull me back. He doesn&#39;t want me in his face all the time, nor do I want to be in his. We&#39;re both free to work and free to live. If he hadn&#39;t married me, I think he would have been some old hermit somewhere, living up in the woods in a cabin, &#39;cause he don&#39;t care about seeing people. He likes his privacy. So I just do my socializing other places.<br>&quot;We never offend each other like a lot of married couples do,&quot; Parton continues. &quot;People say, &#39;You can&#39;t be in love and do that,&#39; but if you ask me, maybe we&#39;ve got the best handle on what love&#39;s all about. To me, obligation is not love. Letting someone be open and honest and free, that&#39;s love. It&#39;s got to be natural and it&#39;s got to come real. I&#39;m not gonna live according to somebody else&#39;s rules. <br><br>Dolly Parton has just turned 46, a fact that anyone sitting across from her, as close as I am, would find hard to believe. &quot;I wish I could stay 21 forever,&quot; she admits. &quot;Don&#39;t we all? But I won&#39;t ever be old in my heart or in my mind.&quot;<br>Commenting on the subject of plastic surgery, Parton is (not surprisingly) as skillful as she is in discussing marital fidelity. &quot;All my life I&#39;ve heard people say, &#39;If God had wanted us to be like this he would have made us this way,&#39; and so on,&quot; she asserts. &quot;Well, God made us naked too. I can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong in doing a little something to make yourself look better so you can feel better about yourself.&quot;<br>I mention the recent nationwide controversy over the safety of silicone breast implants. Is she concerned for herself?<br>Parton remains deliberately vague on that one. &quot;I&#39;ve had my breasts lifted,&quot; she admits. &quot;And I had myself a few little nips and tucks here and there, but I&#39;m not frightened about the work I had done. Everything you do in life carries a risk to some degree, and you just have to decide if it&#39;s worth it. Life&#39;s a gamble, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>Hearing Parton talk about the importance of looking good as a means of feeling good (or, at least, not letting how she looks get <i>in the way</i> of feeling good), I ask about her much-publicized weight gain (and dramatic weight loss) of a few years back. There was a time, she has admitted, when her weight ballooned up to around 150 pounds. In 1987 she trimmed herself back to 110 pounds and, unlike a lot of celebrity dieters, has <i>kept</i> her weight down ever since. But not without constant vigilance.<br>&quot;Losing that weight was the hardest thing I ever did,&quot; Parton admits. &quot;The truth is, I&#39;m a hog. I love food, and I have a problem with it. Love to cook it, love to eat it.&quot; For years, she says, she&#39;d been on one crazy diet after another, her weight constantly fluctuating. &quot;I&#39;d want to go out somewhere and I couldn&#39;t find a damn thing to wear,&quot; she says. &quot;It was a terrible feeling for somebody like me.<br>&quot;I had to reach the point where my health was so bad I almost died before I took control of this thing,&quot; she says. &quot;For me, the answer was getting to eat everything I wanted, prepared the way I like it. Just very small amounts.&quot; True to her independent nature, though, she still likes to pile her plate full. &quot;I can&#39;t stand to think I can&#39;t have something. I don&#39;t want anyone to dictate to me about me. I have to feel that I can have it if I want to, but it&#39;s <i>my</i> choice to do without.&quot;<br>By the looks of it, the method is working well. But Parton adds that though she&#39;s gotten her eating under control, she will always remember how it feels to be addicted. &quot;I have the deepest sympathy for anybody with a weight problem with drugs or alcohol, but I&#39;ve been a food-aholic. I hit bottom.&quot;<br>Parton&#39;s weight problem, which she struggled with during her late 30s, coincided with a crisis she describes as &quot;female problems.&quot; She doesn&#39;t get more specific than that, but one aspect of her troubles was her discovery that she couldn&#39;t have children. &quot;At the time, it was a very painful thing,&quot; she says. &quot;But now I just figure God knew what He was doing.&quot; She and Dean have played a big role in raising Parton&#39;s younger brothers and sisters, and now their children call her Aunt Granny. &quot;I&#39;m a great sister and a great aunt,&quot; Parton says. &quot;I&#39;ve made my peace with not having kids of my own.<br> Before we part company, there&#39;s one more question I burn to ask Parton, not only as a journalist but as a parent. I tell her how much I love her song &quot;Wildflowers,&quot; which describes the desire to be a free, wild flower instead of the fenced-in garden variety. I tell Parton I can&#39;t think of anything I&#39;d be happier to instill in my children than that kind of passion for life, that burning and fearless desire to go out into the world with a sense of joy and hopefulness and enthusiasm. How does she think she got that way? And how can a parent raise a child with her kind of spirit? <br><br>&quot;You just teach them they can&#39;t be afraid to try. What&#39;s the worst that could happen? You go out on a limb, you fall off, you just start all over again, climbing that tree.&quot;<br><br>Parton gets up from her chair (all 5-foot-nothing of her) and gestures toward the bathroom. &quot;What do you say we take a pee break?&quot; she asks, not sounding remotely like a fairy-tale princess. And it occurs to me that just as Cinderella might have represented an ideal to that little girl growing up in a two-room cabin in Tennessee, Dolly Parton herself doubtless represents a similarly glamorous and romantic role model to plenty of little girls (and a few big ones) today. The Dolly Parton who fashioned herself out of a patchwork of icons has now become an icon herself. <br><br>&quot;I guess you could say I created this person, this character,&quot; she reflects. &quot;And I like her.

Under a twirling, mirrored ball, a dozen men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s dressed in evening clothes are dancing to an old-timey band playing &quot;In the Mood.&quot; At the center of the Mayflower Ballroom dance floor, Dolly Parton, in a tight, white confection of a dress, giggles in the arms of a 77-year-old retired Canadian military officer. To prepare for this segment of her new ABC variety show, Dolly, a non-dancer, has dutifully practiced the waltz and the fox trot with the show&#39;s choreographer. But when the band breaks into a rumba, a piece a cake for the elegant, elderly Mayflower habitu&eacute;s, Dolly gamely goes along. &quot;That guy had me all over the place!&quot; she says in her soft, Tennessee-mountain voice. &quot;I stepped on his feet; he almost broke my body!&quot; </div><div align="left">Lately, in preparation for her show, <i>Dolly</i>, Parton also has visited the Los Angeles Zoo, where she asked children such questions as, &quot;Why don&#39;t animals wear clothes?&quot;; a Los Angeles firehouse (&quot;How do you really feel when the alarm goes off?&quot;) and Chippendales, a male strip joint.<br>&quot;She knows and loves her audience,&quot; says Sandy Gallin, the show&#39;s executive producer, who has been Dolly&#39;s manager and partner for 13 years. &quot;She can mix with anyone from the homeless to royalty and be equally comfortable.&quot;<br>Her audience knows Dolly Parton as the sharp-witted, sweet-talkin&#39; mountain girl, who two most famous assets, usually on display in a tight, glittering bodice, definitely have been out-performed by her appealing singing voice, her nonstop energy and her remarkable business brains. In her Marie Antoinette platinum wigs, with her cinched-in curves and painted-on pretty face, Dolly Parton is the Queen of Artificial in an age the worships natural. She&#39;s a sexy dragon lady. . . who has been married for 21 years to a publicity-shy asphalt-paving contractor. She&#39;s a diet freak who lives for days on Jell-O and Jolt Cola, but she likes nothing better than to kick off her snake-skin spikes and cook up a mess of turnip greens, corn bread and fried chicken for her dozens of nieces and nephews. She&#39;s a real live star, with bodyguards, publicity agents, more than $200 million of net worth and upwards of 2000 pairs of shoes, but she prays every day, reads the Bible and gives millions of dollars of charity. She comes on like a lady, but she throws obscenities around like a man. She&#39;s just signed the biggest deal in television history, $44 million from ABC for <i>Dolly</i>, but when she breaks into a grin, she still looks like a mischievous little girl who has raided her mama&#39;s closet and makeup drawer. <br><br>In her 41 years, this 5-foot-1 dynamo has had as many ups and downs as there are on the big rides at Dollywood, her personal amusement park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Raised in a two-room cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains, Dolly was a Grand Ole Opry performer at 12 years old, and at 18 she packed her cardboard suitcase, left her holler home, loving parents and 11 brothers and sisters, and lit out for the big time. Within a few years she was a country star, cutting hit records and winning Country Music Association and Grammy awards, but her early partner and mentor sued her for millions of dollars after they split, and her husband, Carl Dean, was so elusive that a lot of people thought she had made him up.<br>In 1980, Dolly smoked onto the movie screen with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in &quot;Nine To Five,&quot; a comedy about secretarial life for which she also wrote the title song. An Oscar nomination for the &quot;Nine to Five&quot; song and two more movies followed (&quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; with Burt Reynolds and &quot;Rhinestone&quot; with Sylvester Stallone). But from 1982 to 1985, as she approached the age of 40, Dolly was devastated by a combination of heartbreak, major gynecologic surgery and a copyright infringement suit (she was found not guilty) brought by two songwriters who claimed she had stolen part of the theme for &quot;Nine to Five.&quot; Fifty pounds overweight, her third movie an embarrassing flop, forced by depression and medical problems to cancel concerts and appearances, she even thought about suicide. &quot;I said, &#39;God, I gave you credit for all the great things that happened to me&#39;,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I said, &#39;Where are you now?&#39;&quot;<br>But Dolly Parton believes in God without depending on God, and she forced herself back into action. This fall, looking better than she&#39;s ever looked, enjoying the success of her latest album (&quot;Trio,&quot; with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt), thrilled with last year&#39;s opening of Dollywood, she&#39;s up for what could be her biggest hit so far. Dolly is hoping, and literally praying, that her TV show will be more than just a comedy hour. &quot;I want it to be really uplifting, spiritually uplifting, at a time when people need to feel more confident about themselves. At the end of that hour, I want people to feel so good that they&#39;ll want to see it again,&quot; she says, sounding as much like a preacher as a singer. &quot;The human spirit could use a good shot of what I hope this show is going to have.&quot;<br>Dolly&#39;s positive attitude is remarkable in an industry that has seen a number of variety-show bombs in recent years. &quot;Everyone says variety is dead,&quot; Dolly says, with a laugh. &quot;Well, I say, &#39;If variety is dead, what are we doing here? If variety is dead, we&#39;re all in deep shit!&quot; Whatever happens, Dolly has decided to give everything to the show. She won&#39;t just do a good job; she will eat, sleep, and breathe the show. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go at this as if it were the last show I was ever going to do,&quot; she says. &quot;I will lay everything on the line. I will show the people who I am, good and bad. If they want to see me without wigs and makeup, that will happen.&quot;<br>The show will be as homey and jes&#39; folks as Dolly herself. She will take the crew on the road for special events, she will cruise the city toting her own mini-cam for &quot;Dolly&#39;s home videos,&quot; she will visit people at home and in places like the Mayflower Ballroom for scenes that will be sort of country <i>Candid Camera</i>, and she will flirt with surprise guests in a weekly &quot;Dolly&#39;s date&quot; skit. There will be talent tryouts and animal acts, possibly including &quot;Dolly&#39;s dancing doggy,&quot; a terrier named Popeye; she&#39;s even mulling a &quot;This Little Piggy&quot; segment in which she&#39;ll talk with dieters and doctors about weight. &quot;I&#39;ve been on every diet that&#39;s ever been invented,&quot; says Dolly, who is now down to 100 pounds. She has lost weight by limiting quantities instead of giving up her favorite foods. &quot;I hate diets and I hate diet food,&quot; she says. &quot;Now I just say to myself, &#39;Go ahead and eat what you want, but don&#39;t eat it all, you big hawwg!&#39;&quot; She jokingly contemplated having the whole show weigh in on camera once a week, an idea that may be met with less enthusiasm by her staff. But Dolly has enough enthusiasm for all of them. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt so right about anything. I&#39;m really gonna enjoy this show.&quot; <br><br>For our interview, Dolly is wearing skin-tight black jeans, a black cowboy shirt, rhinestone-cuffed boots with heels so high she teeters as she walks across the dusty lot to the sound stage, a snakeskin bracelet, earrings and necklace, and a huge heart-shaped diamond ring that was a present from her husband. (One of the few known details of their personal life is that she calls him &quot;Daddy&quot; and he calls her &quot;Princess.&quot;) &quot;Imagine getting paid to have fun!&quot; Dolly may sound dippy, but in negotiations she insisted on, and got, total creative control. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to have too many chiefs and not enough Indians,&quot; she says, and Dolly will be the show&#39;s uniting center, singing songs and talking to the studio audience. &quot;This is going to be a program for the people who watch TV,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&#39;t care what the critics say.&quot; <br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter what they say, there&#39;s no defining Dolly. She&#39;s a prankster who will pull down her jeans to moon a pal in a passing car, and who, at her heaviest, dressed up in a Santa Claus suit to meet her sister at the airport. Instead of playing down her weak points, Dolly focuses attention where she&#39;s strong. Her glitzy dressing style is, she explains, an effort to enhance looks that are less than naturally beautiful. They are also a reflection of her passion for excess. &quot;I like to take my negatives and turn them into positives,&quot; she says. Dolly is a party girl who can stay up all night dancing, but after the party is over, when everyone else has gone to bed, she does her own best work, in the quiet morning hours between 3 and 6 A.M. She composes with her guitar and a tape recorder, and at her most intense she will write for two or three days, living on snacks and caffeine, and producing five or six songs.<br><br>If there&#39;s anyone who can bring a variety show to life, it will be Dolly, with her relentless positive thinking, her faith in herself and her high comic style. &quot;It all came from wanting more,&quot; she says of her success. &quot;I&#39;ll always be too much for some people, but I&#39;ll never be enough for me.&quot; Dolly Parton has transformed her insecurities and her humble beginnings into the eccentricities of a star. From the start, her best work has been done against the highest odds. The chances that a pint-sized hillbilly girl could make it in Nashville were about as slim as that a country-music star could act along with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. &quot;I&#39;ve just always had a big desire to do things,&quot; Dolly says. &quot;I guess I was too dumb to know that I couldn&#39;t do some things until later when I had gone ahead and done them.&quot; <i>Dolly</i> is the biggest challenge yet for this lady who loves the impossible. Odds-on it will also be her biggest success.  	</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%"><br></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="5" class="WPC-edit-style-none WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23eeeff0&color2=%23cfd2d4" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="8%">  <img align="bottom" alt="Links" height="30" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/IXUV3KsBIfFqGJmA-DoTcg9939/GW35H30" title="Links" width="35"></td>  <td width="83%"><br></td>  <td width="8%">  <img align="bottom" alt="Links" height="30" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/IXUV3KsBIfFqGJmA-DoTcg9939/GW35H30" title="Links" width="35"></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>  <tr>  <td bgcolor="#f26f99" class="WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="100%">  <div align="center">  <div align="center">  <div align="center">  <div align="center">  <img align="bottom" alt="Dolly Parton Articles Page" height="120" src="http://image.wapi.wetpaint.com/image/1/qdhR3xvUizjpxdLmx8iyRQ59360/GW460H120" title="Dolly Parton Articles Page" width="460"></div></div></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div>
