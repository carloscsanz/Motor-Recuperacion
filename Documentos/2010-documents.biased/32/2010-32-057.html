<p>UPDATE: Apple relented. App approved. See <a href="http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2009/11/14/apple-relents-approves-bobble-rep/">here</a>.</p>
<p>- &#8211; - -</p>
<p>Someone at Apple (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL">AAPL</a>) needs to take a refresher course in American history &#8212; and maybe a lesson in libel law.</p>
<p>Last summer Tom Richmond, one of <em>Mad Magazine</em>&#039;s top illustrators and two-time winner of the National Caricaturist Network&#039;s &#034;Caricaturist of the Year&#034; award, began drawing a likeness of every Senator and Representative in the 111th Congress &#8212; 540 caricatures in all, including non-voting members from Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.</p>
<p>The idea, he <a href="http://www.tomrichmond.com/blog/2009/11/09/apple-rejects-my-caricature-app/">explains</a>, was to create an illustrated database for the iPhone and iPod touch that would allow users to find the name, party affiliation, phone number and website of their senators and congresspeople via zipcode or GPS. Each head was placed on one of 12 cartoon bodies and would bobble when shaken or flicked with a finger.</p>
<p>The project was the idea of Ray Griggs, director of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1161064/">Super Capers</a> (rated PG for mild language, rude humor and brief smoking), for which Richmond did the art. Griggs had shown the finished app around and stirred up some interest. He was booked to appear as a guest on Fox News next week with Glenn Beck and Mike Huckabee.</p>
<p>You can probably guess what&#039;s coming next.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Griggs,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting Bobble Rep – 111th Congress Edition to the App Store. We’ve reviewed Bobble Rep – 111th Congress Edition and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section  3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states:</p>
<p>“Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind (text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that in Apple’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory.”</p>
<p>A screenshot of this issue has been attached for your reference.</p>
<p>If you believe that you can make the necessary changes so that Bobble Rep – 111th Congress Edition does not violate the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement, we encourage you to do so and resubmit it for review.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>iPhone Developer Program</p></blockquote>
<p>What someone at the iPhone Developer Program doesn&#039;t seem to understand &#8212; not to get too Glenn Beck about it &#8212; is that ridiculing public figures by caricature is one of those rights honored in American history and enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#034;The really sad part,&#034; writes Richmond, &#034;is that here is an app that might get people interested in who represents them in Washington, especially kids and young adults, and connects people to their senators and representatives via fun and PARTISAN FREE way.</p>
<p>&#034;Please spread the word how stupid this rejection is. Apple of course does not care what its customers think… they consider us morons at best anyway, but it’s worth a laugh and a shake of your head.&#034;</p></blockquote>
<p>Are you listening Phil Schiller?</p>

				<p>I&#039;m an iPhone app developer, and I had an app rejected with pretty much the exact same letter from Apple. My app was called Heads of State, and when you touched the screen a random politicians head would appear, and you use the accelerometer to roll the heads around, in a bed of fire. It was supposed to be for stress release.</p>

				<p>This is Apple&#039;s Cross to bare. If they want to be seen as being fair and consistant, then they are going to have to make the app approval team a very large group. Handling a million apps, it is probably impossible to get it right all the time, but the process needs to be bias and interpretation free. Apple should realize that satire and even ridicule are legitimate opinions&#8230;don&#039;t I&#039;m a Mac ads ridicule PC&#039;/Windows? I agree that Apple can set it&#039;s own standards in this situation, but it feels like they use those standards to hide behind rather than stay consistant. I say all this as a loyal Apple customer. I find little wrong with any product or feature that Apple has offered me over the years, but policy should reflect an even handed approach no matter how highly I regard Apple they need to find a better way to deal with their verifications.</p>

Isn&#039;t that the risk they assume and endure because they are public figures?  If you&#039;re gonna have a policy about ridiculing people &#8211; it should be universal and not discriminate against the &#034;less famous&#034;.</p>

				<p>Here is what I wrote when Alec Vance&#039;s Freedom Time App was rejected last year, and I still think it&#039;s true:</p>
<p>It&#039;s Apple&#039;s attitude towards developers submitting apps to the iTunes App Store of &#034;You play by our rules or you don&#039;t play at all&#034; which is ultimately going to prevent Apple being successful with _all_ of iTunes. No wonder many media companies are making deals elsewhere, giving other online retailers the DRM free music content and TV Show / Movie content that Apples so badly want to sell. Apple is not part of our government&#039;s checks-and-balances system; let the Supreme Court decide what apps are offensive, obscene and indecent (if it has to go that far.) </p>
<p>Apple has created a noose of responsibility for themselves in their overly restrictive iPhone/iPod Touch app policies. Because they insisted on creating the only (legal) avenue for obtaining apps for that platform, they have to deal with their fear that many of their customers see Apple as being ultimately responsible for the apps, not the developers. Where&#039;s free enterprise and the spirit of innovation that Apple so highly values in this case?</p>

Saying one persons name in a group insinuates that not everyone is involved.  No one reading that would assume that all congresspeople would be involved.  &#034;Otherwise,&#034; they&#039;d say, &#034;everyone would be mentioned.&#034;  It&#039;s just a misleading title no matter what you were intending, and if you want to maintain your journalistic credibility, you&#039;ll change it.</p>

I&#039;m saying only that it&#039;s really ironic that the guys who ran the Big Brother commercial back in 1984 are protecting Big Brother&#039;s public image while using Big Brother&#039;s legal mechanism (said DMCA) to prevent a user from cracking the SDK and obtaining Griggs&#039; distributable outside of the iTunes store.</p>

<p>o they have a higher standard than others. Apple has pretty much always taken the high road on these kind of issues. Why do you think that the author of these apps didn&#039;t start at Android&#039;s door. It&#039;s the difference between &#034;works&#034; and &#034;works pretty good&#034;.

				<p>The major issue here that no one seems to notice is that LOTS of apps get rejected and then are accepted on appeal. In this case, if the author had explained to Apple that the caricatures are protected free speech and are not derogatory AND that politicians are public figures and unable to sue, presumably also asking to speak with a supervisor, there&#039;s a good chance it would have been accepted.</p>
<p>Instead, on the first form letter he received, he runs off to his blog and starts with the &#034;Apple is EVIL&#034; nonsense. </p>
<p>Apple made a mistake by rejecting this app &#8211; I think that&#039;s pretty universally agreed. But the author made a mistake by not working with Apple to get it accepted. Is he more interested in getting his app out there or attacking Apple? It seems to be the latter.</p>

				<p>First of all, to bring a constitutional right into the discussion is absurd.  There is no constitutional issue here, as noone is claiming the developer is not permitted to create the image, the issue is that Apple is seemingly unwilling to distribute the image through the iTunes service, which is their right.  Get it right.  That said, Apple is crazy not to add these to its store.  They&#039;re hilarious, and not at all offensive.</p>

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Not exactly, my friend. You can actually put whatever app you want on your phone and create whatever app you want, it&#039;ll cost you about 5k though to hire someone to create it for you. So technically, they are not stopping you from putting whatever app you want on your phone. However, apple owns the app store and they have the right to sell whatever they want. I am not agreeing or disagreeing with the app, but it is totally within their rights to sell whatever they choose to sell.<br />
Also, companies do this all the time in some way or another. Can you run garageband or pages on a PC? So yes, companies can tell you what you can/cannot run on their products.</p>

				<p>Close. Changing the headline to someone with an R in front of their name (McCain) or a different D wouldn&#039;t have made it more accurate. If you choose your headlines to attract at the expense of accuracy you shouldn&#039;t be surprised at strong feelings from commentors.Giving a sigh in your ex-ped responses indicates your getting tired of responding to similar comments but if you stand up in a crowd and make statements as poorly worded as this you can expect more than one or two people to take you to task.  I still think it would be good if you corrected the commentors who were mislead by the title</p>

				<p>What school of Journalism did you go to?  The headline is false!  Your rational that a headline is there to attract attention is also false.  This is not a unique requirement:  You are also required to summarize the main point of the story.  Other equally attention grabbing headlines would include:  Balloon Boy Reports News   </p>
<p>ex ped: Sancto Joe, the headline was chosen to attract attention — that&#039;s the purpose of a headline. But it was not meant as a joke, to be divisive or to further polarize anything. If you go to Tom Richmond&#039;s website — and I hope you do, he&#039;s very good — you&#039;ll see he offered up three sample pages: John Kerry, John McCain and Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi seemed more newsworthy and more likely to draw readers, and so I chose that one. The headline was written to match the illustration. I don&#039;t mind if it stirs people up, but that wasn&#039;t its purpose.</p>

<p>THANK you!  As you can tell from some of the comments, people are finding far darker reasons for this decision of yours.</p>
<p>But why are you surprised?  This country is polarized to an incredible degree, and you pop out a headline that focuses on one of the most polarizing figures out there.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what the reaction would have been from the OTHER side if, say, Sarah Palin was Speaker and you&#039;d used her in your title.  What you&#039;ve seen in the way of  comments would have been a love-tap in comparison!</p>

				<p>I&#039;d encourage you all to read Mr. Richmond&#039;s blog regarding this as well as this article.  </p>
<p>This isn&#039;t a first amendment issue, this is an issue regardig taste. Apple is not held to first amendment rights if they want to accept an application, or reject it.  They can do as they wish.  </p>
<p>Apple rejecting a very helpful application, because they feel Mr. Richmond&#039;s drawings were grotesque, and unflattering is just completely unfounded.  If anyone is familure with his artwork, it&#039;s accurate, , very funny, but fairly tame as well.  Your average political cartoon is far more insulting than any of his work, and the samples I&#039;ve seen of this application. </p>
<p>Apple dropped the ball on this one.  It&#039;s a great idea for an application, and Richmond is a top notch artist with a large following.  I hope they change their mind.</p>

				<p>Phil-<br />
just admit it. You used that title because Pelosi is a lightening rod for the right and the top democrat. Several  commenters clearly thought this app was about pelosi or dems in general. You took the time to try to defend your choice for the title and also to give a more clear explanation of the freedom of speech issues(which I think you should have taken the time to do in the article) but declined to correct people who were misinformed from your writting.<br />
This article seems to be a better example to use in discussing freedom of speech. While I prefer it when writers are more accurate in their work /willing to call their own fouls when they err (you fell short on both counts in my opinion) I would defend your right to speech if the government tried to censor you.</p>
<p>ex ped: I admit that I thought Nancy Pelosi made a better headline than McCain or Kerry. I&#039;m actually quite surprised that it&#039;s stirred up such strong feelings. And you&#039;re right, I should have done a better job explaining the constitutional issues in the story.</p>

				<p>It seems the author snuck a reply into my comment:</p>
<p><i>ex ped: What makes you think an iPhone app isn&#039;t constitutionally protected free speech?</i></p>
<p>It is. But the government isn&#039;t telling the creator of the app that they can&#039;t do it. It is Apple, a private company, simply stating that they are not going to distribute the app on behalf of the author. Which has nothing to do with a violation of &#034;free speech&#034;.</p>
<p>ex ped: I understand that, Aaron. This issue has been thrashed out repeatedly in the thread below. To save you the work of scrolling through 60 or 70 messages, here&#039;s how I answered another reader earlier today: </p>
<blockquote><p>I didn&#039;t mean to imply that Apple was required to approve any application, P. George. My point was that there is a rich history of political caricature in this country, and that Apple — like any other publisher — has nothing to fear from Tom Richmond&#039;s drawings. In fact, were they to be published in the App Store, Apple would be protected from government interference by the First Amendment and would have strong defense in civil court were the company to be sued for libel.</p></blockquote>

I believe Apple has some specific reason for not putting this through. Maybe they don&#039;t want to get negative press (most likely). Maybe they are trying to play nice with the government considering the high potential for antitrust investigations against them these days, since they are attempting to monopolize &#039;a few&#039; different industries. Either way, while I know they preserve the right to reject an app for whatever reason they see fit, not including this app but including gross and truly offensive app shows their true colors.</p>

				<p>I find it amusing and a bit disconcerting that a number of people below have stated something along the lines of the following&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#039;s Apple&#039;s product they can decided what is on it/used for.</p>
<p>I may be naive, but when I give a company my hard earned cash to purchase one of their products, doesn&#039;t it become &#034;mine&#034; to do with as I will?  In the case of the IPhone, I then pay an ongoing fee each month to use that phone via AT&amp;Ts network.  </p>
<p>I find it interesting that at least a few of you feel that you had no rights because it was Apples product.  What if AT&amp;T decided that they found certain web content to be objectionable and they were going to systemically block it?  What if Time Warner, Cablevision, or Comcast said something similar?  Now I know this isn&#039;t a direct parallel but it&#039;s close enough.</p>

				<p>I&#039;m far more upset over the title of this piece than the rejection of the program by Apple!</p>
<p>Maybe you think using Speaker Pelosi in the title was a joke, or maybe you thought it would attract more attention to your article.</p>
<p>But in case you haven&#039;t noticed, we are polarized as a country, and Speaker Pelosi has become a symbol to one half of the polarized for everything they hate about the federal government.  So neither of those reasons is worth the divisiveness that you&#039;ve encouraged.</p>
<p>Change the title.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>ex ped: Sancto Joe, the headline <em>was</em> chosen to attract attention &#8212; that&#039;s the purpose of a headline. But it was not meant as a joke, to be divisive or to further polarize anything. If you go to Tom Richmond&#039;s website &#8212; and I hope you do, he&#039;s very good &#8212; you&#039;ll see he offered up three sample pages: John Kerry, John McCain and Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi seemed more newsworthy and more likely to draw readers, and so I chose that one. The headline was written to match the illustration. I don&#039;t mind if it stirs people up, but that wasn&#039;t its purpose.</p>

So if you&#039;re writing an article about the recent devastation in El-Salvador and you see a guy waist deep in water, do you title the article &#034;GUY WAIST DEEP IN WATER&#034; or do you title it more appropriately to the content, like &#034;Devastation in El-Salvador kills dozens&#034;??

				<p>I agree that Apple can do whatever they want even if it&#039;s silly. For those of your touting open source, remember that more hands in the kitchen doesn&#039;t necessarily make dinner faster.  Because apple is closed source and restricts developers, system resources are utilized efficiently and you don&#039;t get the problems of multiple programs trying to use the same resources.</p>

				<p>1.  I think Apple has the right to enforce its user agreement as long as it does so uniformly and fairly.  (Banning Pelosi bubbleheads while allowing Palin bubbleheads, or vice versa, would clearly be inappropriate.)</p>
<p>2.  But just because Apple has that right, doesn&#039;t mean that they have not gone a bit too far here.  PED has a good point about the Apple agreement referring to libelous, etc images, but political charicacture is clearly a well-established practice and a legitimate 1st Amendment defense for Apple and the App developer.  And the idea of using these images as an adjunct to a database on politicians is I think a particularly appropriate/worthy use.  </p>

				<p>So what you are saying is that people have a Constitutional right to add an application to the iPhone? Really?</p>
<p>Can I add a column to your website? Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Next time, give it a few minutes of thought before clicking &#034;post&#034;, ok?</p>
<p>ex ped: I didn&#039;t mean to imply that Apple was required to approve any application, P. George. My point was that there is a rich history of political caricature in this country, and that Apple &#8212; like any other publisher &#8212; has nothing to fear from Tom Richmond&#039;s drawings. In fact, were they to publish them in the App Store, Apple would be protected from government interference by the First Amendment and would have strong defense in civil court were the company to be sued for libel.</p>

				<p>This article doesn&#039;t really related to Nancy Pelosi specifically. I read it because I thought Apple was getting political in who can or can&#039;t get ridiculed, but it turns out they banned all the images of any congressmember so your title is misleading and upon finishing the article, it turns out, it&#039;s a nonissue.</p>

				<p>Thanks for replying to my previous post with: &#034;ex ped: I chose that headline only because the post was illustrated with Nancy Pelosi&#039;s caricature.&#034;</p>
<p>But I hope you are aware that this article is linked from other sites, finance.yahoo.com for example, and only with its headline? Sorry, but for me this is either a case of shoddy editing or deliberate misrepresentation.</p>

				<p>Apple have their right under the constitution as well.  One great thing about this country is if you don&#039;t like something you don&#039;t have to go there, buy it, see it, or force to hear it. And just because Apple is a publicly  traded company, doesn&#039;t mean that they have to do everything the people want them to do, like putting the bobble heads on their aps.</p>

				<p>I also think Government pressure may have influenced Apple to reject this app because the Democrats are afraid of being bombarded and lambasted with communication. They don&#039;t want to make it easy for Americans to contact their congressmen and they are afraid of opposition. Just remember Government officials. You work for us, we pay your salaries and you need to be  working and available for the people and not trying to avoid our comments and requests. The Democrats seem to have their own agendas and wish to keep them closed to the American public.</p>

				<p>&#034;and maybe a lesson in libel law.&#034;</p>
<p>Are you an attorney? If not, you&#039;re in no position to make that statement. Apple has to consider libel laws in every state AND every country where they sell iPhones. What might be permissible in one country might be grounds for legal action in another. </p>
<p>I&#039;m not an attorney, but I spent 5 years as the Chief Sysop of a very active (up to 500 messages/day) forum on CompuServe. We had the ability to delete messages or move them to a private area. I and my staff were under strict instructions from CompuServe AND from our boss, who WAS an attorney, to immediately remove any message that sounded like it might be libelous or defamatory. The key, he said, was that, because we COULD remove messages, we were in a more vulnerable position than, say, a BBS that didn&#039;t monitor comments. The Communications Decency Act changed the situation, but it mostly made it more complicated.</p>
<p>In this case, Apple is applying its rules uniformly, without regard to the &#034;public figure&#034; status of the subjects. </p>
<p>&#034;ridiculing public figures by caricature is one of those rights honored in American history and enshrined in the Constitution.&#034;</p>
<p>.Where in the Constitution or Federal law does it say that a publisher (which is probably how Apple would be viewed by the courts, given that they review and approve apps) must publish every bit of political speech that anyone submits? Apple is not &#034;censoring&#034; the developer. He is free to produce whatever political speech he likes, but Apple is not obligated to publish what he creates. If Apple did so, they might be held equally liable as the developer/author.</p>
<p>I suspect that Apple&#039;s attorneys reviewed this one. They may have been concerned about setting some sort of precedent and being put into the position of evaluating just how libelous/defamatory particular material is. (I.e., where do you draw the line? Why not fake nudes of politicians? Why not a bobblehead of the Pope?  </p>
<p>BTW, why did you mention Speaker Pelosi? If all members of the Senate and house are covered, why not use, say, Senator Lieberman, or one of the Republican leaders? Oh, maybe this is a clue:</p>
<p>&#034;He was booked to appear as a guest on Fox News next week with Glenn Beck and Mike Huckabee.&#034;</p>

If I understand correctly the application has not been rejected because Apple is particularly fond of Nancy Pelosi, but because Apple&#039;s developer team seems to interpret the term &#034;defamatory&#034;  very broadly.</p>
<p>So I&#039;d say you failed at &#034;not to get too Glenn Beck about it&#034; as a misleading title line like that is very much his style.</p>

<div class="authorboxHeading">Philip Elmer-DeWitt</div>
<div class="cnnBlurbTxt">Steve Jobs, goes the old joke at Apple, is surrounded by a reality distortion field; get too close and you might believe what he&#039;s saying. Apple has made believers out of millions of customers &#8212; and made a lot of investors rich &#8212; but Elmer-DeWitt believes that an ounce of skepticism never hurts when writing about the company. He should know. He&#039;s been covering Apple &#8211; and watching Steve Jobs operate &#8212; since 1982.</div>
