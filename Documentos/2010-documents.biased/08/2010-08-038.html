<!-- End of JavaScript Tag --></p><p>This is a question that has been on my mind for some time, and despite researching around the web, I was not able to find a clear and definitive answer.</p>
<p>How often does Google update its SERPs?</p>
<p>That is, how often does it incorporates the information that it gets from its crawling bots and applies it to the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages)?</p>
<p>I think there are 2 possible cases here. On the first one Google would update the SERPs in real time and constantly, as soon as new information is retrieved from its crawling bots. For example, if a bot was crawling a certain page and discovered that the Title tag was changed, it would immediately report it back to a central data center, that would in turn update the database and the ranking positions for this particular website.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that Google has a fixed schedule to update all the results together. For example, it could do it once every 48 hours, and on every update it would combine all the data retrieved from crawling bots and recalculate all the SERPs simultaneously. The schedule here could be daily, every 48 hours, every week and so on.</p>
<p>This factor is quite important because it gives bloggers and webmasters a time frame to check the results of your optimization efforts. Suppose you discovered that all your h1 and h2 tags were messed up on your site. You learn how they should be properly used, fix the problem, and then start monitoring specific keywords to see if your ranking positions will be affected. </p>
<p>But how long should you wait to see the results? Let me know what you think!</p>

			<p>From my experience I think it updates as soon as Google has it&#8217;s crawlers information. </p>
<p>I think this because new blog posts or any other page for that matter, can get indexed as soon as 5-10 minutes after you&#8217;ve made the post.</p>
<p>For new pages it&#8217;s definitely not 48 hours.</p>

			<p>The answer is that it depends on the site in question. Some sites are crawled all the time and each page probably gets hit at least once per day. On other sites a page might go 6 months between crawls.</p>
<p>Once a page has been crawled it is usually a matter of 1 minute to 24 hours before the index is updated.</p>

			<p>@MrCooker, could be. I have seen changes take as long as a couple of days to appear thouhg.</p>
<p>@Patrick, what you think influences if it will be 1 minute or 24 hours?</p>
<p>The crawling rate is no mystery, I wonder how often Google uses that info into the SERPs though.</p>

			<p>It may very well depend on the crawl rate, domain age and authority. Daniel, maybe you should publish a post, make sure it is indexed and then make a small but identifiable change and then check how long it takes to update that info on SERPs. I&#8217;ll be doing it too, and it&#8217;ll be a fun and educating experience <img src='http://www.dailyblogtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  (DBT is more authoritative, and mine&#8217;s not, so it could also give us an insight into variations betwen domains).</p>
<p>Speaking of messed up h1s and h2s, the last time I checked, DBT&#8217;s index had h1 for each post (while most sources advise one h1) and even Google does not recommend multiple h1s on a page.</p>

			<p>I deal mainly with sites that have been around for a while. I don&#8217;t have  a new site to test currently. But I have seen changes in SERP&#8217;s within 24 hours. And when I purposely try to rank a page, I see the inkling&#8217;s that it worked within 3 to 4 days it seems.</p>

			<p>@Sumesh, we can try. The problem I see with that is that small changes would hardly be noticeable, and that we can&#8217;t control external factors like people linking to you post.</p>
<p>To test this one would need to create a hidden page, get it indexed, and then totally screw it up to see how long it would take for Google to remove it from the index.</p>
<p>@Everyone, keep in mind that getting a post indexed and getting one that is already indexed to change its ranking position can be two different things for Google.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve always debated about this with friends. My opinion is that they do update their SERPs almost real time, meaning as soon as they received changes from their crawler bots, they&#8217;ll make the updates.</p>

			<p>The reason new posts get indexed almost immediately is WordPress  automatically pings popular Update Services. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services" rel="nofollow">http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
  Here are the stats for my latest post:<br />
  20/May/2008 17:01:20 &#8211; Published<br />
  20/May/2008 17:01:41 &#8211; Mediapartners-Google bot (AdSense) visited the new page (in 21 seconds!!), the home page and the feed<br />
  20/May/2008 17:02:00 &#8211; FeedBurner indexed the feed<br />
  20/May/2008 17:02:13 &#8211; YahooFeedSeeker visited the home page<br />
  &#8230;<br />
  20/May/2008 17:43:11 &#8211; Googlebot visited only the new page (40 minutes later)<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>The new post can be found in search result.</p>
<p>During the next two days Googlebot occasionally visited random (not all) pages, including the home page.</p>
<p>The excerpt from the home page result and its cached version is still a week old. And Google Webmaster Tools (<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/</a>) still says &#8220;Googlebot last successfully accessed your home page on May 16, 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the Google Webmaster Tools is the crawl rate &#8211; &#8220;See statistics about how often Google crawls your site, and optionally adjust that speed if desired.&#8221;</p>

<p>  How often will Googlebot access my web pages?<br />
  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=33569&amp;topic=8843" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/.....topic=8843</a><br />
&#8220;For most sites, Googlebot shouldn&#8217;t access your site more than once every few seconds on average.&#8221; <img src='http://www.dailyblogtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Anyway, after you&#8217;ve optimized you tags and keywords, and Google has updated your page in its database, you will not immediately see the effect. It may take weeks and months. As they say, &#8220;relevancy is determined by over 200 factors&#8221; and many of those factors are external and don&#8217;t have anything to do with your tags optimization.</p>
<p>So, fast conclusions based on two day&#8217;s search result position fluctuation may be inaccurate.</p>

			<p>I am sure it totally depends on the website popularity in the eye of google. the more the number of visitors the more it will be crawled becuase i have seen many website with same and old content like online aution site or shopping site which is having similar content for years are crawled daily becuase of the number of visitors per day.</p>
<p>And i have seen many website upadate content daily and crawled weekly or fortnight so it all depends on the traffic you got.</p>

			<p>I have a slightly different question. Does anyone know why google search results only appear within a certain time of the day. I have noticed that only between a certain time of the day do I see a traffic spike on my site. In fact,  the only time my site starts showing up on the SERP for the same keywords is between 4 a.m &#8211; 7 a.m. any other time for the same keywords my site does not show up on the first couple of pages.</p>

			<p>Looks like we are talking about different things here.<br />
I agree that pages get indexed and updated in Google&#8217;s cache quickly but search positions are updated very slowly. In my experience it takes weeks and sometimes months to move from serp 100+ to say 10+ . Other experiences?</p>

			<p>Dress up games,  Google knows about your other links, and factors them into your serps, however, when you use  link:yoursite.com to see them, that only provides a sampling (usually the most relivent or higher ranking links) the best way to see what links google has picked up is webmaster tools &#8220;pages with external links&#8221;  this will show you what pages have links to them from other sites, and how many links they have,  click the number of links to see them.  one of my sites shows 0 links in search, but 300 in webmaster tools.</p>

			<p>Ok  i&#8217;ve done some researching, and spoke to some &#8220;insiders&#8221;.  this is how it works </p>
<p>   Changes to your site will start to effect your serps, 24-48 hours AFTER YOU WERE LAST CRAWLED.   But may not be consistant, untill all the data centers are updated. (around a week) </p>
<p>   so make sure you have backlinks, from forums that are crawled daily. (like this one) the quicker google bot, gets to your site,  the sooner you will see updates in serps.</p>
<p>    Info for your &#8220;webmaster tools&#8221; is collected from all the data centers and applied weekly. mine seems to be on tuesdays.</p>
<p>    Page rank is calculated weekly.   but the pagerank browser tool is only updated every 3-4 months.  ( it may tell you your site is a PR 2, but google already sees it as a PR 3) The last update was JAN 1 09</p>
<p>    Backlinks will start to effect your PR  1 week after they are discovered</p>

			<p>I have seen SERPs changes every day &#8211; even every hour.<br />
One day, one of my articles gets 370, the other day 150. One article gets 150 and then 30.<br />
Some other articles climbed from 1visit to 20 visits. </p>
<p>So, SERPs changes very often.<br />
Though, I just can’t check every phrase that often, I can figure out that this is not a visit-trend but rather changes in the SERPs. </p>
<p>However, the average site’s visitsis not changed that much –like a give and take. ..</p>

			<p>I think with higher page ranking you get the googlebot visiting you more frequently and so your website will be updated and indexed faster. Websites with lower page ranking and traffic will have longer to wait for google to update and index. I found my new site was indexed very quickly to begin with but now I am still waiting months for pages to be indexed. Changes that I make to new pages take a long time to appear in the search results. Also google is contstantly updating its page ranking internally so even if you have a low page rank showing it may be that you are getting better spidering and faster indexing if it deems your page rank has gone up. Then we get those times during the year when the page rank visibally changes for all to see.</p>

			<p>Did you find out the answer?</p>
<p>I think it depends on the keywords you&#8217;re targeting&#8230; For instance, it took me 1 month to rank #4 in a major keyword (200,000,000 other pages), while it took me 1 week to rank #1 in a minor keyword (2,000,000).</p>

			<p>My experience is that Google update the seps results throughout the day.  For instance a major PLC company hires a leading SEO company and withing time rankings appear higher fluxuating for certain keywords daily until it reaches its peak positon.  Positions of key terms for a website can and do fluxuate from position one to 3 and off the first page and return agin later in the day.  Fluxuations occur as the search term is competitive.</p>
