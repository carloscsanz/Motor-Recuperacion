        Manager</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">AngelouEconomics</p>
      <p>In the wake of the bursting 
        of the technology bubble in 2001, economic developers focused on high-tech 
        industries attempted to diversify the technology economies of their communities. 
        For many economic developers, diversification away from the traditional 
        high-tech industries of software and information technology led to efforts 
        focused on growing and attracting emerging industries such as biotechnology, 
        nanotechnology, and renewable energy. While some cities have succeeded 
        in attracting these high stakes, specialized industries, many smaller 
        communities have largely failed to develop alternatives to traditional 
        high-tech industries. As a result, economic developers are once again 
        looking to information technology to help grow their high-tech employment 
        base.</p>
      <p>One emerging niche sector of 
        the information technology industry is the nationwide investment in data 
        centers. As the need for data storage and server farms continues to grow, 
        data center operations have become the most recent target of economic 
        development efforts. In this article, I will explore the rise of data 
        centers as an enabler of information technology, trends in the data center 
        industry, why communities should be targeting data centers as part of 
        their economic development strategies, and what site selection characteristics 
        a community needs to attract data centers to their community. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="secondaryBlue">What 
        is a data center?</span><br>
        Data centers are any building designed solely to house computer equipment. 
        Data centers can serve multiple functions, including housing computer 
        processing power, hosting enterprise software applications for large companies, 
        housing networking equipment, including website servers, and perhaps their 
        most common function, housing data storage and backup facilities for companies. 
        A data center typically provides some level of on-site information technology 
        staffing, redundant electrical and mechanical systems to maintain computers 
        in an ideal operating environment, and increased physical and information 
        technology security beyond what would be available at a company&#8217;s 
        offices. </p>
      <p>Data centers are classified 
        into four tiers according to ownership and reliability. These ratings 
        are maintained and defined by the Uptime Institute, though the Tiers function 
        more as guidelines than as formal classifications. Data center reliability 
        is measured by &#8220;uptime,&#8221; or the amount of continuous time 
        that a data center can operate without interruption. As the amount of 
        uptime needed for a certain business has increased, data centers have 
        been built to house increasingly complex mechanical and electrical support 
        systems and more IT professionals. Additionally, as the complexity of 
        data center support systems have grown more robust, data center capital 
        expenses have increased dramatically. The Tiers of data centers are as 
        follows:</p>
      <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;"> 
        <p> <span class="secondaryBlue">Tier 
          I-II:</span> Tier I and II data centers were first built in the late 
          1960s and early 1970s. These data centers were first established as 
          enterprise (owned and operated by one company for internal use) computing 
          centers, but now are typically owned by operating companies and leased 
          for use by small businesses and for backup data storage. Tier I and 
          II data centers typically have only one source of power, water, and 
          internet access, though Tier II data centers provide redundant on-site 
          systems to prevent downtime from equipment breakdown. Tier I and II 
          data centers provide the most amount of downtime, usually rated as approximately 
          1 day per year.</p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Tier 
          III:</span> As additional services and more uptime became standard in 
          the mid-1980s, Tier III data centers were first introduced. Tier III 
          data centers are typically owner-occupied, and are used for IT service 
          centers and help desk operations for companies. Tier III data centers 
          provide larger support space, longer staffing hours, and less downtime 
          (typically around 2 hours per year) than Tier I and II data centers.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span class="secondaryBlue">Tier 
          IV: </span>Tier IV data centers, first introduced in the mid-1990s, 
          provide virtually uninterruptible access to data and computing services 
          and are the most up-to-date, secure, and in-demand data centers. Both 
          enterprise and for-lease Tier IV data centers have been developed, as 
          even small companies will increasingly require little to no downtime 
          in access to data storage and enterprise computing applications. Tier 
          IV data centers have the highest power requirements (more than 150 watts/m2), 
          and provide large support spaces, 24-hour staffing, and uninterruptible 
          cooling with virtually no downtime (less than 30 minutes per year). 
          Tier IV data centers require multiple active and redundant sources of 
          electricity, water, and fiber-optic cable access, as well as redundant 
          mechanical and electrical systems in the data center itself. Tier IV 
          data centers do not have downtime for maintenance, and are extremely 
          resistant to downtime caused by electricity outages, as most Tier IV 
          have independent backup generators. New Tier IV data centers being built 
          in the U.S. range from 75,000 to 250,000 square feet of raised floor 
          space at a cost of roughly $220 per square foot. Tier IV data centers 
          require 15-20 megawatts of power per 100,000 square feet of raised floor.</p>
        </blockquote>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the data center industry 
        has matured, Tier IV data centers are virtually the only type of data 
        centers currently being constructed. While data centers are still relatively 
        unknown in the economic development world, there are many drivers of growth 
        and emerging trends in data centers that economic development organizations 
        and site selectors should understand to best attract and site data center 
        operations. </p>
      <blockquote style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;
        </blockquote>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="secondaryBlue">Trends 
        in the data center industry</span><br>
        Many different industries utilize data centers for their operations, including 
        nearly all Fortune 1000 companies. In addition, health care providers, 
        financial services companies, banks, telecommunications firms, and any 
        internet-based companies, especially search engines, e-retailers, and 
        web hosting providers also utilize data centers. The growth in data center 
        utilization is being driven by a variety of factors, including:</p>
      <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;"> 
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">IT 
          Consolidation:</span> As data center usage grew over the past 15 years, 
          companies often created ad hoc data centers within or near existing 
          operations, with a result of multiple data centers constructed with 
          different underlying technologies, redundant overhead and staffing costs, 
          and soaring electricity costs. Companies have discovered great cost 
          savings from IT restructuring and consolidation by combining these data 
          center operations into larger, more reliable, and more standardized 
          operations based on updated technologies. In general, this movement 
          to large Tier IV enterprise data centers is the primary driver behind 
          the growth in data centers and provides the best opportunities for communities 
          to attract data centers.</p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Increased 
          reliability and technological needs:</span> At the same time as companies 
          were expanding data centers, computers continued to grow more powerful 
          and consume more electricity, which has become one of the largest costs 
          for many technology companies. Higher computer density, increased uptime 
          and backup requirements, and the replacement of outdated Tier I and 
          II data centers has been a prime driver in data center growth in the 
          past few years. </p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Government 
          regulations:</span> In the wake of Enron and the growth in health care 
          services, government regulations regarding corporate information and 
          private health care information have been strengthened. Sarbanes/Oxley 
          has required additional data storage for corporate activities, while 
          HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) has required 
          the digitization of health care records and increased technical and 
          physical security to prevent the disclosure of medical records. These 
          activities require large data storage centers which must be accessible 
          continuously.</p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Disaster 
          prevention and recovery:</span> After 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, companies 
          have realized that offsite, disaster-resistant data centers are necessary 
          to ensure continuity of operations in the wake of a disaster. New Tier 
          IV data centers are being built in retired Air Force bunkers and silos, 
          in underground locations, and in rural areas outside of companies&#8217; 
          primary markets to ensure that interruptions due to natural disasters, 
          terrorism, or catastrophic electrical grid failure do not prevent ongoing 
          operations of a company. Sun Microsystems has announced a plan to build 
          a portable data center in a shipping container which would be able to 
          be transported to help companies rebuild their data from disasters. 
          Some companies such as Continental Airlines are even co-locating emergency 
          operations centers with these secured data centers.</p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Internet 
          market growth: </span>Perhaps the biggest driver of data center growth 
          is the explosive growth in internet-based businesses, including search 
          engines, electronic banking, and e-retailing. Data center developers 
          have estimated that demand for new Tier IV data centers is outstripping 
          supply by approximately 20-25% per year. With almost 5,000,000 square 
          feet of data centers built in 2006 alone, communities have an unprecedented 
          opportunity to capture data center growth. Google, Yahoo, eBay, and 
          Microsoft have been among the largest builders of new data centers in 
          the United States over the last few years. Google&#8217;s data centers 
          store copies of the entire internet in their data centers to better 
          serve their search customers, while e-retailers must be able to service 
          their far-flung customers and long-tail business models with robust 
          data storage and web service. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="secondaryBlue">Why 
        your community should target data centers?</span><br>
        While diverse and various trends are driving the growth in data center 
        construction, most communities have not targeted data centers as a source 
        of economic growth in their communities. There are, however, a number 
        of reasons to seek to attract data centers to your community. First, data 
        centers provide tremendous capital expenditures, including local purchases 
        of construction materials for these complex centers. Additionally, data 
        centers provide construction jobs and often use local vendors for cleaning, 
        landscaping, and security services. The most compelling reason for data 
        center attraction is that data centers provide high-paying service jobs. 
        Data center-associated jobs, including information technology repair and 
        upkeep jobs, software developers, and electrical and mechanical maintenance 
        provide excellent wages and benefits for employees in a community. In 
        March 2007, Google revealed that its data center operations in Lenoir, 
        North Carolina would employ 250 people at an average wage of $48,000, 
        which does not include the additional maintenance and security services. 
        A typical data center can employ up to 100 people per 100,000 square feet 
        of raised floor space. This number increases depending on the type of 
        data center services provided; data recovery, call centers and help desks, 
        disaster command centers, and personal data storage requiring regulatory 
        oversight services all require additional employees. </p>
      <p>In addition, as electricity 
        costs and power consumption from data centers continue to increase, many 
        data center owners and operators are looking to provide more environmentally 
        friendly options for their customers. Recently announced &#8220;green&#8221; 
        data centers utilize green-building standards and are often powered by 
        renewable electricity. These type of data centers can help provide communities 
        a foothold into the growing renewable energy and green-building construction 
        sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p>Finally, communities that are 
        attractive to data centers can often build a cluster of high-level information 
        technology services from data centers. San Antonio, Texas offers a glimpse 
        at an emerging data centers cluster, with the announcements of Microsoft, 
        NSA, Stream Realty, and Christus Health locating in San Antonio over the 
        past year. While the clustering of data centers has typically been confined 
        to areas near major clusters of internet-based businesses, including New 
        York City, Washington, and Silicon Valley, as electricity costs and disaster 
        recovery continue to grow in importance, many secondary markets have opportunities 
        to build clusters in high-paying IT jobs associated with data centers.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="secondaryBlue">What 
        do site selectors look for?</span><br>
        To best attract data centers, communities must meet the strict site selection 
        requirements for data centers. AngelouEconomics typically provides reverse 
        site selection services to communities to help evaluate sites and community 
        suitability for data center location as well as site selection for data 
        center clients. Given data center industry growth and the lack of suitable, 
        data center-ready sites, communities that pre-plan for data centers will 
        quickly move to the top of the site selection list. Our data center clients 
        focus on a number of measures of appropriateness for data center sites, 
        including:</p>
      <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;"> 
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Community:</span> 
          A community seeking data centers must meet several site selection requirements. 
          Communities located near major cities and corporate centers will be 
          able to provide access to data centers without the risks of location 
          in a major metropolitan area. Communities with direct air service to 
          these major cities will also benefit. Besides proximity to major metro 
          areas, though, data center operators look primarily at two factors: 
          electricity costs and labor availability and costs, as these are the 
          primary drivers of data center operating costs. Industrial electricity 
          rates under 5 cents per kilowatt hour are essential to attracting data 
          centers. As cheaper-powered locations are increasingly saturated with 
          data centers, this ceiling may begin to rise. Labor availability focuses 
          on the availability of college-educated workers, specifically in the 
          information and business &amp; professional services sectors, in a community. 
          Communities with lower than average labor costs will also play well 
          with data center developers, though this is less important than electricity 
          cost and labor availability. Communities should also be relatively immune 
          from natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and earthquakes that 
          would disrupt service. </p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Site:</span> 
          Once a community has been identified as being able to provide cheap 
          electricity and a suitable number of workers, site-specific locations 
          must be examined to determine appropriate sites. Data centers require 
          large parcels of land for expansion and security of the facility. Sites 
          of 75 to 100 acres are typically required, though larger sites can also 
          be used. Some sites may have existing buildings suitable for data center 
          development, although greenfield sites are typically preferred. </p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Utility 
          availability and taxes:</span> Sites must be served by two independent 
          electricity transmission connections. These connections must tie into 
          different electrical grid substations so as to provide the most uninterruptible 
          power supply available. Multiple fiber optics providers able to serve 
          the site are also a necessity, so that downtime on one network will 
          not bring down the entire data center. Water service onsite, along with 
          sufficient service and low industrial rates will also be necessary for 
          successful data center sites. Low utility taxes and franchise fees will 
          also reduce costs for data centers. </p>
        <p><span class="secondaryBlue">Disaster 
          risk and incompatible uses:</span> Sites must be relatively immune to 
          site-specific risk. Sites located in a flood plain will be automatically 
          excluded from data centers, as would locations near coastal areas vulnerable 
          to hurricanes. Data center operators also typically like to avoid areas 
          near flight paths, rail lines, fault lines, and other abutting and onsite 
          uses which produce large amounts of vibration and electromagnetic interference. 
          Sites that are located in areas without these drawbacks will be very 
          attractive to data centers.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">Ultimately, data centers provide 
        an excellent opportunity for rural, mid-sized, and large communities to 
        attract IT infrastructure and jobs. Enterprise Tier IV data centers, which 
        provide virtually uninterruptible access and 24 hour staffing, are being 
        built across the nation to catch up with the surge in demand caused by 
        increased governmental regulation, IT consolidation, and growth in electronic 
        services. Small towns like Quincy, Washington, The Dalles, Oregon, and 
        rural parts of North and South Carolina have been transformed by corporate 
        data center locations. Data centers offer these areas one of their only 
        opportunities to attract a corporate technology presence. While most of 
        these communities lack traditional technology sector assets such as large 
        research universities and local venture capital, small communities have 
        significant advantages within the data center niche. By pre-planning for 
        data center sites, communities providing low cost utilities, an available 
        workforce, and disaster resistant sites can benefit from the wave of new 
        data centers being built throughout the nation.</p>
