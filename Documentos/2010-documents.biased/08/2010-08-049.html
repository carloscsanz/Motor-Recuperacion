	<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/logos/amd_logo.png" width="99" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Many people ask me the same question, why someone buy an AMD processor. The truth is that AMD's recent price drop made several powerful models look good again, compared to Intel's Core2 Duo line. After extensively checking with the specs and online prices, a friend of mine bought an AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ at the retail price of <strong>115 euro</strong>. There is no real competitor at this price range and if the embedded 2x1MB L2 cache works as we imagine it'll probably be a serious contender to the much higher rated Intel CPUs.  But first let's see what this dual-core Athlon has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>- AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+</strong></p>
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/amd_athlon_x2.png" width="77" height="88" align="right" />AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ is not a newly introduced processor. In fact it has been in the market for a long time but due to its high price it wasn't affordable for a large number of users. The Windsor core  design that this processor is based has a die size of 90nm and consumes 89 watts. AMD's line goes  up to 3.20GHz (6400+) with the same characteristics. The well known Athlon X2 features are present here: <em>MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, Enhanced 3DNow!, NX bit, AMD64 (AMD's x86-64 implementation), Cool'n'Quiet, AMD Virtualization</em> technologies. The most noticeable features are the build-in L2 cache (2MB total) and the frequency of 2800MHz (14x200Mhz). The maximum Vcore is around 1.35V according to the full  specifications: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/everest_1.png" width="484" height="489" /></p>
<p>AMD processors are well known to have superb memory performance, since the memory controller is embedded in the processor. The test results are very good for AMD X2 5600+, it almost reached 9MB/sec. That performance should give the 5600+ a good boost for future real life application tests.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/everest_2.png" width="485" height="445" /></p>
<p>At the CPU/FPU tests, we noticed two strange things. First of all at the CPU AES and CPU Zlib tests, the 5600+ came first, while at CPU Queen came second overpassing even the Intel E6300. Again at the FPU tests we can see some good performance from the 5600+. </p>

It should provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software. It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, PCI, PCIe, ODBC Connections, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc. Sisoft Sandra offers a variety of tests for  Memory and CPU. </p>
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/sandra_3.png" width="481" height="486">Again the memory performance was very good for the 5600+... </p>

<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/sandra_1.png" width="485" height="485" />The CPU tests are dominated from the  E6600 as  expected. Passing to the Java, .NET tests, we can see that in several sub-tests the 5600+ performed very well and reached the first place.</p>

<p>At ScienceMark, that mostly uses memory bandwidth, the 5600+ gets the first place, while at Pov-Ray, the  E6600 comes first.</p>

<p><strong>- x264 Benchmark </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=442" target="_blank">x264 Benchmark</a> unleashes the next generation of Video Encoding benchmarks with support  for x264 codec that is considered to be one of the most demanding for  Video applications. Simply put, this test measures how fast your  machine can encode a short, DVD quality MPEG-2 video clip into a  high-quality x264 video clip. The author believes that &quot;<em>...it's  ideal for a benchmark because the application (x264.exe) reports fairly  accurate compression results (in frames per second) for each pass of  the video encoding process, and it uses multi-core processors very  efficiently...</em>&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.nerodigital.com" target="_blank"></a><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/Logos/x264bench.png" width="460" height="230" /></p>
<p>The benchmark procedure is very simple. You just run a batch file that  encodes the same file five times. There are two kinds of results, for  first pass and second. We summed and took the average, which we post in  the results below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/x264.png" width="479" height="446" /></p>
<p>Superb performance from AMD's 5600+ with 76.16 and 18.58FPS performance when encoding x264. </p>

	<p><a href="http://www.xtremesystems.com/pi/" target="_blank">SuperPI</a> has become an utility to benchmark modern systems. In August 1995, the  calculation of pi up to 4,294,960,000 decimal digits was succeeded by  using a supercomputer at the University of Tokyo. The program was  written by D.Takahashi and he collaborated with Dr. Y.Kanada at the  computer center, the University of Tokyo. This record-breaking program  was ported to personal computer environments such as Windows NT and  Windows 95 and called Super PI.</p>

		10. Lost Planet: Extreme Condition
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	<p><strong>- Lost Planet: Extreme Condition </strong>(DirectX9) </p>
<p>The game's plot focuses on the amnesiac character Wayne Holden, his  father, Gale Holden, and the past and future of the planet E.D.N. III.  After a particularly vicious battle against a large Akrid known only as  &quot;Green Eye&quot;, Gale is supposedly killed, and Wayne lost on the icy  planes of E.D.N. III . The planet of E.D.N III is perpetually cold and  snowy, originally inhabited by a species of aliens known as Akrid, who  forced humanity to abandon E.D.N. III by strength of numbers and  surprise, which can be found in many and varied forms.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/Logos/lostplanet_1.jpg" width="490" height="240" /></p>
<p>They all share one trait; Thermal Energy, or T.Eng., as it's called in  the game. This powerful energy source, found only in Akrid bodies, made  humankind determined to fight them after having to retreat from this  new menace. They created the Vital Suit, or VS, technology, essentially  heated mechs with mounted weapons and powered by T.Eng.</p>

<p>In order to benchmark a graphics card, we used the Demo version that includes a &quot;Performance Test&quot;  function. We used the default demo visual settings for all test. There  are two test results from two different animated courses that are  reported as &quot;Snow&quot; and &quot;Cave&quot;:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/Logos/lostplanet_3.jpg" width="490" height="276" /></p>

<p> Let's now see the performance of the tested processors:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/lostplanet.png" width="481" height="319" /></p>
<p>The  5600+ has very good gaming performance. All the CPUs are close and that's because all the &quot;hard work&quot; is done by the graphics card. Intel's CPUs are only faster by 2-3 fps! :-)</p>

		11. Overclocking
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	
<p>Its not a big secret that users shouldn't expect much in the overclocking area from such a high speed processor.  For this test, we replaced AMD's stock cooler with Artic Cooling's <a href="http://www.arctic-cooling.com/cpu2.php?idx=79&data=4&disc=">Freezer 64 Pro</a> to get maximum results. The next step was to test and trial how high we could push our CPU. Remember to reduce the HyperTransport Multiplier from 5X to 3X. The maximum core voltage should be around 1.35V (in any case we left the 'Auto' setting). By using ASUS AiBooster we easily reached 3.10GHz, that's approximately 10% more, so there isn't  much to gain from. We tried to further push the processor's speed and at 3.2GHz  the system started to freeze. It's possible that with a different motherboard/cooling combination someone could get better (or worse) results.</p>

		12. Final thoughts
	<hr WIDTH="98%"></h5>
	
<p><img src="/Sections/Articles/Sources/A/AMD Athlon X2 5600+/Images/logos/amd_logo.png" width="99" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />The Athlon  64 X2 5600+ is one of the  lowest priced (in the $100-150 price range) AMD processor you can buy today. Its retail price of <strong>&euro; 115,</strong> makes it a very interesting choice, considering  what Intel offers at this price range. There are not much to discuss here, we have thrown tons of tests that showed a mixed bag image. The memory performance is better at AMD processors than Intel's and that's a fact.</p>
<p> The embedded memory controller, the 2x1MB L2 cache and the 2.80GHz helps this processor to perform superb in several tasks and of course rank high in benchmarks. Depending the task, it's even possible to see the  Athlon  5600+ to complete the task faster than even an Intel E6600 processor. There is an area where currently sold AMD processors cannot compete,  the overclocking. Unfortunately, the X2 5600+ runs already in high speed  so you can only squeeze a few MHz from it. So I wouldn't try to overclock an AMD Athlon X2 5600+ unless its absolute need. Overall we are satisfied from what the Athlon X2 5600+ has to offer in both performance and pricing.</p>
