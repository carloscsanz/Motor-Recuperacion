<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

This paper describes the
<a href="http://fuzine.vperson.com/mlm/lycos-home.html">Lycos</a> and
<a href="http://thule.mt.cs.cmu.edu:8001/jrrl-space/webants.html">WebAnts
project</a> projects at the <a href="http://www.mt.cs.cmu.edu/cmt/CMT-home.html">Center for Machine Translation</a> (CMT) at
Carnegie Mellon University. Lycos is an experiment in best-first-search
within the space of documents formed by the Web. WebAnts is an
experiment in distributing the information collection task to a number
of cooperating processors. We also discuss directions for future agents
that act as proxies for people who will soon be too busy to answer
their email. <p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

 The Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon University researches
and develops software for automatic translation of text from one language into
another. In order to translate text, we have a large technology base of
natural language processing resources, algorithms, techniques and expertise. <p>

 We have also applied these natural language processing methods to the
problems of information retrieval and organization. We are now focussing our
attention on the Web as a textual resource of vast breadth and depth. <p>

<h2>Lycos: Hunting WWW Information</h2> <p>

The <a href="http://fuzine.vperson.com/mlm/lycos-home.html">Lycos</a>
project at Carnegie Mellon is in the early stage, we have a Web
explorer in operation, and our indexer will come on-line later this
month. We will use the
<a href="http://fuzine.vperson.com/scout/home.html">SCOUT indexer</a>
which has an HTTP gateway (a set Sample database of the Tipster corpus
from Wall Street Journal is available intermittently from the
Experimental SCOUT server). <p>

 Lycos is written in Perl, but uses a C program based on CERN's libwww to
fetch URLs. It uses a random search, keeps its record of URLs visited in a
Perl assoc list stored in DBM (thanks to Charlie Stross for the tip that Gnu
DBM doesn't have arbitrary limits!). It searches HTTP, FTP, and GOPHER sites,
ignoreing TELNET, MAILTO, and WAIS. Lycos uses a data reduction scheme to
reduce the stored information about each document:

<ul>
<li> Title
<li> Headings and Subheadings
<li> 100 most "weighty" words (using Tf*IDf weights [Salton & McGill 83])
<li> First 20 lines
<li> Size in bytes
<li> Number of words
</ul>

 Lycos keeps a word frequency count as it runs...it has read over 25 million
words. A list of the most frequent words found after searching 6.3 million
words is available off the <a href="http://fuzine.vperson.com/mlm/lycos-home.html">Lycos</a> home page. <p>

 Lycos searches the entire Web, not just HTTP servers. So far, the breakdown
of file types found is:
<pre>
         142132 http
         102910 ftp
          84143 gopher
           4314 news
           1396 telnet
            379 mailto
            244 wais
             13 rlogin
</pre> <p>

 Citation counting (number of "parents" by URL): this is the first 20 URLs
sorted by number of documents that reference that URL. What I did not do was
to count only references from different sites (I'm sure that 99% of the refs to
http://gdbwww.gdb.orf/omim come from the Genome Database server itself).

 The Lycos philosophy is to keep a finite model of the web that enables
subsequent searches to proceed more rapidly. The idea is to prune the ``tree''
of documents and to represent the clipped ends with a summary of the documents
found under that node. The 100 most important words lists from several
documents can be combined to produce a list of the 100 most important words in
the set of documents. <p>

 Alternative fixed representations of documents or document sets include the
vector models such as Dumais at BellCore [Deerwester et al. 90, Dumais et al.
94] and Gallant & Caid at Hecht-Neilson Corporation [Gallant et al. 94]. The
number 100 was chosen arbitarily, so we will need to investigate to find
whether than number is too high or too low. <p>

 One perhaps unique aspect of Lycos is that it uses the text in the parent
document to describe the unexplored links (currently, the highlighted text from
each anchor is associated with the URL for that anchor). In this way, Lycos
can retrieve documents that it has not even searched. <p>

 Once the exploration and retrieval functions are in place, we will turn to
experiments in ``best-first-search,'' to be able to process on-demand queries
by searching the webv in a knowledge-directed way. <p>

<h2>WebAnts: Hunting in Packs</h2> <p>

The <a href="http://thule.mt.cs.cmu.edu:8001/jrrl-space/webants.html">WebAnts
project</a>, also in the early stage, is progressing with cooperation
in mind. Like Lycos, this project makes a clear preference for
explorer-based schemes over those that require cooperation from each
information server [Flater & Yesha 93, Koster 94a, Koster 94b]. There
are several motivating issues behind this project. First, information
discovery on the web (including gopher-space and ftp-space) is now (and
will remain) too large a task. Given that there are currently several
thousand web and gopher servers and an order of magnitude more ftp
servers, and that these numbers are growing, the scale is too great for
the use of a single explorer agent to be effective. <p>

Second, it is undesirable to rely on a single site for such services,
as this would create a bottleneck. Creating a single explorer site does
nothing to solve the fan-in, fan-out nature of the information
discovery problem, but rather exacerbates it, making that one site a
bottleneck for all users. <p>

Finally, it is undesirable for multiple explorers to examine the same
sites [Eichmann et al. 94, Koster 94c]. This situation would be worse
than relying on a single information server, since it is certain that
net traffic would be higher and it is uncertain that better results
would be achieved. This is, unfortunately, almost what we have now. To
search for information on a general topic, a user cannot rely on a
single search engine, since none of them explore everything. <p>

To address these issues, the WebAnts project is developing a
cooperative explorer agent; that is, an explorer (or ant) which will
share results with other ants and not duplicate their efforts. Another
system that employs multiple agents is the WebCrawler [Pinkerton 94],
although it is unclear as to how distributed these agents are. The
WebAnts model could be used for either searching or indexing, although
at the moment, we are concentrating on searching, until we have settled
on a design for the index. <p>

For searching, we expect this cooperation to be very effective, in that
the different ants may be directed based on others' results. If one ant
finds a document that satisfies the search criteria, it can share the
references from that document with any other ants that are not
currently exploring hits of their own. And as each ant explores a
document, it lets other ants know, so that they do not have to examine
the same document. <p>

For indexing, this cooperation allows each indexer to conserve
resources, and also to distribute the indexing load between different
explorers. Each index server would provide all the information gathered
by one of the ants during exploration. When querying, a user could
restrict the query to the local ant or allow it to propagate to the
entire colony. While this does not solve the fan-in, fan-out problem at
the macro level, it does serve to reduce the bottleneck effect. This is
a simpler version of the &Uuml;bernet used by ALIBI [Flater & Yesha 93]. <p>

One issue that the WebAnts project does not yet entirely address, but
which any indexer must eventually deal with, is that the size of an
index will grow proportionally to the size of the web. The storage,
retrieval, and distribution of information on the scale will no doubt
prove a compelling challenge in coming years. <p>

<h2>The Future of the Web</h2> <p>

We categorize Web agents into two broad classes: those that ``pull''
information out, such as the WebCrawler and Lycos, and those that
``push'' information back out, of which the best example is fictional.
In Cold as Ice, [Sheffield 92] describes ``faxes,'' which can be
defined as expert systems that can oversee experiments, answer
questions, and replace many of the functions of secretaries and
assistants. <p>

It is this second kind of agent that we hope to build in the future,
building on our success with TinyMUD agents such as Julia [Mauldin 94].
Instead of looking for answers, a proxy agent might read newsgroups
looking for questions relevant to its owner's areas of interest, might
send email to people working on a problem that the its owner has
several publications that might be relevant, and might sort, prioritize
and even answer email.  <p>
