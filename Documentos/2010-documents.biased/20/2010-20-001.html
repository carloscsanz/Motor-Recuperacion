1942.7 [U.S.A.] The Berkley summer study. A. Compton had asked theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California-Berkleyto study the feasibility of a nuclear weapon.

[Oppenheimer, H.Bethe, E.Teller, John Van Vleck, FelixBloch, Richard Tolman, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, L.Alvarez, J.Lawson,Robert Thornton, Robert Becker] Feasibility concluded. The chief uncertainties lay in the experimental values for neutron cross-sections, numbers of neutrons that would be produced in fission and cause other atoms to fission in a rapid chain reaction. The scientists suggested that such a reaction could be initiated by assembling a critical mass--an amount of nuclear explosive adequate to sustain it--either by firing two subcritical masses of plutonium or uranium 235 together or by imploding (crushing) a hollow sphere made of these materials with a blanket of high explosives (Tolman). Teller saw another possibility: by surrounding a fission bomb with deuterium and tritium, a much more powerful "superbomb" might be constructed. This concept was based on studies made by Bethe before the war of energy production in stars. When the detonation wave from the fission bomb moved through the mixture of deuterium and tritium nuclei, they would fuse together to produce much more energy than fission, just as elements fused in the sun produce light and heat. The summer conferences, the results of which were later summarized by Serber in "The Los Alamos Primer" (LA-1),provided the theoretical basis for the design of the atomic bomb, which was to become the principal task at Los Alamos during the war, and the idea of the H-bomb, which was to haunt the Laboratory in the postwar era.

Concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons systems. A diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize the risk that these weapons ever be used and to facilitate the process of their total elimination. The engagement as soon as appropriate of all the nuclear weapon States in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons. Arrangements by all nuclear weapon States to place, as soon as practicable, fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under IAEA or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes, to ensure that such material remains permanently outside of military programmes.10.Reaffirmation that the ultimate objective of the efforts of States in the disarmament process is general and complete disarmament under effective international control. 11.Regular reports, within the framework of the NPT strengthened review process, by all States parties on the implementation of Article VI and paragraph 4 (c) of the 1995 Decision on "Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament", and recalling the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996. 12.The further development of the verification capabilities that will be required to provide assurance of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapon free world.

The other ships headed to sea are frigates and guided missile destroyers capable of shooting down aircraft. 4 p.m: U.S. officials said there are "good indications" that Saudi militant Osama bin Laden, suspected of coordinating the bombings of two U.S. embassies in 1998, is involved in the attacks, based on "new and specific" information developed since the attacks. 
2001.9.12 [U.S.A.] IPPNW published astatement "... We support the efforts by US and international authorities to identify the perpetrators of this crime against humanity and to bring them to justice... We cannot help but think of the consequences had nuclear weapons been used in this attack. The deaths and injuries would have numbered in the millions, and the hospitals and other emergency response infrastructure would have been destroyed, making it impossible to rescue and care for survivors.... What befell New York and Washington must force us to consider the prospect, indeed the seeming inevitability, that one day terrorism will go nuclear. The US, as the world's richest most technologically advanced country, is most susceptible to nuclear terrorism. No nation, therefore, has more benefit to derive from the abolition of nuclear weapons.

The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for a period of 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions required for nuclear weapons. The incident was reported to the top levels of the United States (U.S.) military as a Bent Spear incident, which indicates a nuclear weapon incident that is of significant concern, but does not involve the immediate threat of nuclear war.

I think the shaping and casting of the plutonium was supposed to be in Syria.�h The September 6 raid over Syria was carried out by the US Air Force, the Al-Jazeera Web site reported Friday.

Preventing the Spread and Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction:A World Without Nuclear Weapons:America will seek a world with no nuclear weapons and take concrete actions to move in this direction. We face the growing threat of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons or the materials to make them, as more countries seek nuclear weapons and nuclear materials remain unsecured in too many places. We will maintain a strong and reliable deterrent as long as nuclear weapons exist, but America will be safer in a world that is reducing reliance on nuclear weapons and ultimately eliminates all of them. We will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of U.S. nuclear weapons policy.Secure Nuclear Weapons and the Materials to Make Them:We will work with other nations to secure, eliminate, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and materials to dramatically reduce the dangers to our nation and the world. We will convene a summit in and regularly thereafter) of leaders of Permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council and other key countries to agree on implementing many of these measures on a global basis. End the Production of Fissile Material:We will negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and work to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.End Cold War Nuclear Postures:We will work with Russia to take as many weapons as possible off Cold War, quick-launch status, and extend key provisions of the START Treaty, including its essential monitoring and verification requirements. We will not develop new nuclear weapons, and will work to create a bipartisan consensus to support ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which will strengthen the NPT and aid international monitoring of nuclear activities.

According to some expert estimates of current numbers, the new commitment would mean each side scrapping almost 1,000 warheads.The pact signed also calls for the number of strategic delivery systems to be reduced to between 500 and 1,100 on each side, from 1,600 under current treaties.

The resolution calls for states with nuclear weapons to continue disarming, to ratify a ban on testing them and to agree a treaty stopping the production of fissile material. In return, non weapons states should accept stronger safeguards designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.The resolution, however, is non-binding, and there are many obstacles to its aspirations becoming reality.

Some will kill. Some will be killed.War, in one form or another, appeared with the first man." " At the dawn of history, its morality was not questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease - the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences. Over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, so did philosophers, clerics, and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war." " The concept of a "just war" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when it meets certain preconditions: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the forced used is proportional, and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence. So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths - that war is sometimes necessary, and war is at some level an expression of human feelings."
