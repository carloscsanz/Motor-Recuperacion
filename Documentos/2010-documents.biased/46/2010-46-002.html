<strong><a name="snyderh" id="snyderh">Snyder, Howard H. </strong> aged 90 passed away Sunday April 5, 2009 in St. Louis <br>

<strong>Howard H. Snyder</strong>,  Lt Col USAF Retired, aged 90, passed away Sunday April 5, 2009.<br>
<br>
After retirement from the USAF, Howard spent many years at McDonnell Douglas in responsible roles in Logistics on several programs including F-4, F-15, F-18.<br>
The following obituary information was gleaned from obituaries in the St. Louis PD Today, and Washington Post:<br>
Mr. Snyder served in WW II and the Korean Conflict and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Deployed with the 97th Bombardment Group, he piloted B-17 (Flying Fortress) bombers for the First, 8th Air Force, daylight, precision, strategic bombing campaign of WW II against enemy targets in occupied Europe and later for the North African Campaign. Lt Col Snyder remained in the U.S. Air Force following WW II, retiring in 1960 after a 20-year career. Subsequently, as a private industry aeronautic engineer, he joined McDonnell Douglas, Martin-Marietta, the Rohr Corporation and the Society for Logistics Engineers. At McDonnell Douglas, Mr. Snyder supported the F-4 Phantom I and II fighters, was a principal in the development team that launched the F-15 Eagle, and capped his career with initial stage development of a new fighter project, the F-18 Hornet. Visitation was Friday, April 10, 2009, at KRIEGHAUSER WEST Mortuary, 9450 Olive Blvd., Olivette, MO 63132. Private services were held at Arlington National Cemetery. Should friends desire, memorials may be made to Disabled American Veterans. <br>
<strong> To all MAC retirees, friends, teammates:  Please dig into your memories, and see if you can provide any information to help Howard's daughter, Sandra Klassen obtain more information about her father's career and involvement at MAC.</strong>Klassen 
Following is Sandra's note:<br>
<br>
"Hello Earl & Norman,<br>
I'm seeking your help on two matters.<br> 
<br>
First, I sadly want to inform you of the death of my father, Howard H. Snyder, aged 90, in St. Louis, Mo. on April 5, 2009.  He was born June 19, 1918.   He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on October 16, 2009.  I noticed that you make record of the passing of old teammates on your obit page and thought you would wish to be notified.<br>
<br>
Second, I am seeking more precise and detailed information about the aircraft and projects he worked on during his tenure at Mac.  As far as I know, He worked as a logistics engineer on the F4, F15, & F18  between 1961-1982.<br> 
<br>
It would be nice to learn whether any of his old teammates are among your group, as I would very much like to meet any colleagues who remember him when I return to St. Louis in March.<br>
<br>
Thank you for any help you can provide.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sandra J Klassen<br>
<br>
Call or email Earl or Norm and we will give your Sandra's email and phone number<br>

<br>
Harold has always served the Lord through work at the churches he attended. He served as congregation president, chairman of the Board of Elders, chairman of the Board of Directors, Sunday School Superintendent, and the Finance Committee. He enjoyed volunteering with the "Wednesday Guys", who made repairs and did other odd jobs for Zion's School. Harold has had a long time interest in music and was a choir director at two former churches. He sang in choirs since the third grade, including his time in the Navy where he sang with the "Blue Jackets" while in boot camp at Great Lakes, Illinois.<br>
<br>
Harold's hobby was model railroading and he always had an active railroad layout in his home. He loved to play cards, work crossword puzzles, and read the funny papers.<br>
<br>

Lehstein who was waitressing at Turner's Coffee Shop.  Jack and Kitty were married on September 2, 1967, in
Kitty's hometown, Canton, MO.<br>

moved to St. Charles, MO, where their second daughter, Jackie Lynne was born.  Jack and his family lived in
St. Charles for 20 years.  Jack was a Business Manager at McDonnell Douglas.  He worked on programs
such as Gemini, Space Lab, Apollo and Harpoon.  In 1972 Jack moved his family to New Melle, where he
bought a little ranch house on 13 acres.  They had several ponies, horses, dogs, cats and one pig.<br> 
<br>
Jack enjoyed traveling and visiting with his family and friends.  He and his family went on many trips enjoying

David Forney, Jr., Susan Forney Boyd, Priscilla Forney Canny, James S. McDonnell, III, and John F. McDonnell; sister of Hamilton M.

A charming and gracious friend, an intelligent and sympathetic companion, Priscilla (known to her friends as Pris or Pussy) was raised in Greenwich, CT, graduated from Vassar College in 1936, and came to St. Louis in 1956 upon her marriage to James S. McDonnell, Jr., founder of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation (later McDonnell Douglas). She was deeply involved with Planned Parenthood in Connecticut and St. Louis, eventually joining the group's national board. She was an avid golfer and tennis player, as well as an enthusiastic gardener, a long-time member of the Ladue Garden Club, and a devoted supporter of the Missouri Botanical Garden. She loved to travel all over the world, thrilled to host the Mercury astronauts as McDonnell Aircraft built the fist NASA spacecraft, and mastered e-mail before many of her grandchildren. Most of all, she adored her large and sprawling family, regularly sending batches of cookies to her college-aged grandchildren and dispatching annual valentines signed with x's and o's. Services: A memorial service will be held at a later date. A private burial service has been held at Bellefontaine Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions to the Missouri Botanical Garden, Planned Parenthood, Vassar College or the charity of your choice. A service of THE LUPTON CHAPEL<br>

<strong><a name="oldegh" id="oldegh">Harry W. Oldeg</strong>,  died Wednesday, January 28, 2009<br>
<br>
David Gibson provides the following information about Harry Oldeg:<br>
According to Ray Hill, who once ran McDonnell's Cape Canaveral operations and later the Dragon missile facility in Titusville, Harry had been ill for some time. He  had had to quit attending a routine lunch that several of the VPs who came in in the 1940s used to join--Oldeg, Ray Hill, Harold Motchan, Fred Sanders, maybe others....more than six or seven years ago.<br>
<br>
Harry spent most, if not all of his career in Contracts, before ultimately becoming the Fiscal Vice President of what was variously known as McAstro and as some of the variations of MDAC in St. Louis.  He worked on the manned space programs and on missile programs going back at least to the Navy's Talos ramjet antiaircraft missile.
<br>
I think he retired around 1980 or 1981 (?).  That would mean that he joined McDonnell in the second or third year of the company.
<br>
I remember his relating the story about a discussion he and Walter Burke had had with Werner Von Braun about a cost overrun of some kind.
<br>
If you reviewed something with him he might bring up a rather minor detail that had been discussed a year before.
<br>
I last saw Harry when I bumped into him in a mall during the 'harsh reality' days.  He asked something to the effect of how had management been able to get things so fouled up!
<br>
To me, Harry always exhibited more class than most people I can remember, and everyone who knew him referred to him as a gentleman, usually with one or more superlatives added.<br>

After retiring from NASA, Bud came to work for MDC and was involved in several engineering responsibilities on space and missile projects.  It was during the Skylab years that Bud met and later married Cleta Cherry, also a Mac's Old Teammate.  Our prayers and thoughts are with you Cleta,  and  the other family members.<br>

<strong><a name="debellisr" id="debellisr">Roy DeBellis</strong> passed away Saturday, December 8, 2007<br>
<br>
From the St. L. Post Dispatch 12/12/07:
<b>DeBellis, Roy</b> died December 8th, 2007 after an extended illness.<br> Born January 21st, 1936 in Chicago, Illinois to Rocco and Frances DeBellis, he grew up in the Chicago neighborhood of Elmwood Park, went to Fenwick High school and then to college at the University of Notre Dame where he graduated with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1957.<br> After getting married and graduating, he served in the US Air Force at a strategic air command base in California. It is rocket science... Roy and his family moved to southern California where he started a career at Douglas Aircraft during which time he attended UCLA to obtain a masters degree in Astronautics ending with a thesis in orbital mechanics.<br> He transferred to McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis, Missouri in the late sixties and over the years worked on numerous aerospace related projects, including various missiles, the space shuttle, nuclear fusion, and other weapon systems involving various cutting-edge technologies. He retired at the age of 70 from Boeing in 2006.<br> A modern renaissance man.... His interests and talents throughout his life were diverse. His intellect and wit were certainly a gift that served him well in his career but many people outside his career admired and appreciated those traits as well. He had talents in music playing the piano and the guitar as well as singing. He enjoyed the arts, classical music and opera. He enjoyed theater and wrote and directed numerous plays over the years for church groups and other organizations. He appreciated art and had artistic talents with wood carving and drawing. He enjoyed literature. He wrote and published the sci-fi novel (Ladybug) in 2003. He was well-traveled and enjoyed geography, and languages...he could speak and understand Italian as well as French and even Latin. He loved good food and fine wine and was very talented and accomplished in the kitchen. He most enjoyed cooking with the person he loved...Diane, his life partner and best friend. <br>The important stuff.... The greatest gifts Roy DeBellis had were his integrity, his love of family and his passion for life. His un-ending wit and wonderful sense of humor endeared anyone who was lucky enough to meet him. His ability to communicate and make anyone feel comfortable and welcome was unusual to say the least. He enjoyed people ...and if you were lucky enough to be called his friend you never (ever) had to worry about his loyalty and commitment.<br> Even in the throes of being very, very ill...the love he had for his family....and his family's love for him was unyielding. And throughout it all...he never lost his sense of humor. Surviving are his wife (of 51 years) Diane, his daughter Gina, son Doug, daughter-in-law Sue, and four grandchildren whom he loved dearly: Cara, Hunter, Maria and Anthony.<br>
<br>Services: <br>
A small private service with the immediate family will be held where Roy is to be interred. <br>

Following message received from Ruth Trammel 11/15/07:
<i>This was sent to me this morning. Jerry Kaibel was a great friend to so many at McDonnell Douglas/Boeing and I worked with him in Planning on the ACM 
program but knew him for many years. He started in the Aircraft side and later went to the Missile division. He was 65 years old and had been retired about 4 years.
Another great loss and sad that he didn't have more years with his family after retiring but he did get to see his new grandson.<br>
Ruth</i><br>
<br>
The following note from Tony Venezia, Mfg. Tech. Analyst at Boeing:<br>
I received a call last night from Jerome Kaibel JR informing me that we lost our friend and retired Boeing employee, Jerry Kaibel yesterday afternoon(Nov 14) .  The only detail he could give me at the time is that Jerry was helping a friend and it is assumed he had a heart attack.  He had not gotten a full report when he called.  Preliminary plans at present are to have a viewing at Baue Funeral home in St Charles, hopefully this Saturday or Sunday.  He will notify me and I am sure some of you, when plans are firm. I am sure some you were also on the list of friends for Jerry Jr to call,  I am sending this note to everyone on my list that knew Jerry.  I am sure there are more people in Manufacturing Engineering and Boeing,
especially Missiles that had this great person touch their lives... IF you can think of anyone.. Please contact them and let them know of our loss. <br>

Following info. received from Dick Fall:<br>
<i>"I received this e-mail from Marlene Otto. I don?t know if all of you knew Owen. We worked together in Advanced Missiles and became very good friends. I last talked to him in October. He was having problems but it didn?t sound so serious then.  One of my memories of him and Marlene was 4 or 5 years ago on a Sunday morning in church. When we got up to leave, I looked around and there sat Owen & Marlene.  A complete surprise. They were Snow Birds down here for the winter. We had a lot of good times that winter with them, He was a great guy and a sharp engineer."<br>
Hope you are all OK,<br>
Dick"</i>
--------------<br>
<i>"Dear Melba and Dick:<br>
    I haven't had an opportunity before now to let you know that Owen passed away on Monday morning, 1-22.  He was on<br>
 hospice care the last week so we had all the necessary equipment and medicines at home.  Our daughter and son were here 
 several days before and we all were with him when he left this life and entered into eternal glory.<br>
    The service was today at our church, Peace Lutheran, and we leave tomorrow for Omaha, where our niece, Pam, lives.
  A short service will be held at Lincoln Memorial in Lincoln, NE where burial will take place on Friday.<br>  
    I'll be staying in Omaha for a few days and Pam will bring me back to the Lake and stay here with me a few days.<br>
    This type of cancer is hard to overcome and it just took over.  Thankfully he didn't seem to be in pain the last few days.  However, that meant he also was heavily medicated so only had a few minutes at a time when we thought he was able to realize we were with him. True to the statistics, pancreatic cancer usually allows a person only six months from diagnosis and that was true in Owen's case.<br>
    Please keep your messages coming as we both enjoyed receiving them.<br>

pilot with the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.<br />
He joined McDonnell in 1946 as an aerodynamicist. He was promoted to

F3H Demon program for the Navy and the F-101 Voodoo for the Air Force.
In 1958 he was named company-wide project manager for the F-4 program

        Herman Barkey, the McDonnell Aircraft chief engineer who did the first
        drawings of the airplane that become the famous F-4 Phantom, died Dec.
        9. He was 96.<br />
        Born in North Judson, Ind., Barkey studied mechanical engineering at
        Notre Dame before graduating from the University of Detroit in 1932 with
        a degree in aeronautical engineering. He worked for the Hamilton
        Standard and Curtiss-Wright companies before joining McDonnell in St.
        Louis in 1945.<br />
        He worked on several early projects, including the XF-85 Goblin and
        XF-88 Voodoo experimental fighters, and the F2H Banshee carrier-based
        fighter. In the fall of 1953, Barkey laid down the initial drawings of
        what was then McDonnell Model 98. A year later, after the company
        received a contract from the U.S. Navy for two prototype aircraft, he
        was named senior project engineer for the F-4 development program.
        In 1970, Barkey was named vice president of engineering for tactical
        aircraft. He received the prestigious National Aircraft Design Award
        from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1973 for
        his work on the F-4 Phantom.<br />
        He retired from the company in 1974, but returned to the St. Louis plant
        to take part in celebrations for the Phantom's 20th, 25th, 30th and 35th
        first flight anniversaries.<br />

        Herman Barkey's daughter, Bonnie Barkey Moore provides the following additional information:<br />
        <i>&quot;To give you background on Dad - My parents moved to the condos at Mari de Villa Retirement Center in June 1996 and lived there until June 2004 at which time they moved to the Assisted Care Buiilding.  My mom passed away in September 2004.<br />
        For the last several years Dad remained in good health except he used a walker since his legs were not as good as they had been.  In the spring of 2005, age 96, he began having problems, had a pacemaker put in in July 2005, had some complications in August but at Thanksgiving seemed to have recovered.  We attended the Brunch at Mari de Villa with him at Thanksgiving and all seemed well.  Things seemed to start shutting down the week before he passed away.  Actually, even on Wednesday, he was still sitting up and dressed and ended up only spending one day in bed (Thursday) and passed away Friday morning.<br />
        Take care and stay healthy.<br />

        <br />
All  - <br />
        <br />
        With sadness and regret I'm writing to let you know that my dad, Jim McGarry, 
        passed away this evening.  He died peacefully and comfortably after spending 
        the last 8 weeks in intensive care battling complications from liver cancer.  
        My dad loved life and wanted to fight to the very end, but I believe he was 
        ready for this day.  My mom was a constant and forever hopeful companion by his 
        side through this struggle.<br />
        <br />
        Thank you to each of you for being a friend to my mom and dad. <br />
        We are in the process of making arrangements, but feel free to contact us if 
        you have any questions.<br />
        <br />
        Kindest Regards,<br />

        Many of you may have worked with or knew Frosty at MDC. If you can
    think of anyone else who knew him please pass this on.
    Having been the engineering manager on the Model 227 Program, Frosty
    succeeded Logan T. MacMillan (who passed away last year) as program
    manager when Logan retired.  Frosty was from Oklahoma.  He always smoked
    a corn cob pipe, and one Christmas his wife gave him a finned titanium
    pipe that used corn cob bowl liners.  His musical tastes centered on
    country banjo stuff that was far too country for me.  Great guy, highest
    integrity, generous, thoroughly decent.</p>

        Frank Duda sends the following information:
        &quot;I read that John Mullen died on June 29, 2004.  His death notice was in the Post-Dispatch on July 4th and 5th.  Many people knew Dr. Mullen from his work at McDonnell and his unusual outside activities.<br />
        John started at McDonnell in June 1958 right out of Washington University.  He was a brilliant engineer and scientist, earning a PHD at Washington University.  He attacked everything he did with great vigor, always wanting to be the best.  At times in his life, he was an avid roller skater, ice skater, tennis player, and bridge player.  He built a large concrete sailboat in his back yard, floated it down the Mississippi, and eventually to the open waters of the Gulf and beyond.  He restored some antique airplanes, was a partner in Creve Coeur airport, and was an avid pilot.  He probably still holds the speed record for his travel time one day from Bldg 33 to Bldg 102 in his racing Corvette.  He was a very interesting personality.&quot;<br />

        Dr. Mullen graduated from Washington University, BSEE, &amp; became a Research Scientist for McDonnell Douglas acquiring his Doctorate in Nuclear Physics. He continued at McDonnell Douglas until it was acquired by Boeing &amp; he retired. During life he was an avid aviation enthusiast, flying &amp; restoring antique aircraft at Dauster Flying Field/Creve Coeur Airport. He also worked part time as a professor at Washington University.<br />

        <b>Burton &quot;Burt&quot; Sorkin</b><br />
        Engineer, accordion player<br />
        Worked at MDC as Ground Support Equipment designer on Skylab Program <br />
        <br />
        Burton Sorkin spent years toiling over problems as a civil engineer, but he was better known as an accordion player
        who spread hope and joy.<br />
        <br />
        Burton Sorkin died Thursday (March 4, 2004) at Missouri Baptist Medical Center of complications of kidney disease.  He was 80 and lived in Creve Coeur.<br />
        Mr. Sorkin was born in St. Louis. When he was 12, his parents gave him an accordion to help him overcome his bashfulness.<br />
        Mr. Sorkin received a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He worked for Standard Oil of Indiana, first in Chicago and later in Wood River. In the 1960s, he joined McDonnell Douglas Corp. and designed ground equipment that launched the Skylab space projects.<br />
        About 30 years ago, he helped found Hashemesh, an Israeli folk music quintet. The group plays at bar and bat mitzvahs, weddings, festivals and at benefits for Jewish agencies.<br />
        <br />
        Seven years ago, he suffered a stroke. He made progress walking but lost movement in his fingers for weeks.  In an article in the Post-Dispatch, he recounted how he had spent hours in his hospital bed at Barnes-Jewish Hospital willing his fingers to move. Finally, at 2 a.m. one day he got a flash of movement in a finger. With therapy, he was able to play on an electronic accordion that was less demanding than a manual one.<br />
        <br />
        Three years later, he began returning to the hospital's stroke rehabilitation unit to play for patients and staff.  He talked about stroke survivors living with both acceptance and hope.  &quot;When he asked how many patients could raise their hands high, not many could,&quot; said Bea Sorkin, his wife of 53 years.  &quot;He told them that he once had been like that, too.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        Mr. Sorkin was buried Friday, March 5 2004 at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in Chesterfield.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to his wife, among the survivors are three sons, Murray Sorkin of Creve Coeur, Jerry Sorkin of Philadelphia and Chuck Sorkin of Austin, Texas; a sister, Libby Sorkin Routman of Creve Coeur; and four grandchildren.<br />

      A memorial gathering will be from 2 to 4 p.m. Feb. 28 for Logan Tompkins MacMillan, project manager for the old McDonnell Aircraft Corp.'s Mercury space capsule, which carried the first American into space.<br />
        The gathering will be at Mudd's Grove at 302 West Argonne Drive in Kirkwood following a private burial at Forever Oak Hill.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Logan Tompkins MacMillan</b>, project manager for the old McDonnell Aircraft Corp.'s Mercury space capsule program that sent the first American into space, died Dec. 27, 2003, of lung cancer at his retirement home in La Jolla, Calif. He was 82.<br />
        <br />
        A longtime resident of Kirkwood, Mr. MacMillan moved to California in 1977 after his retirement from what by then had become McDonnell Douglas Corp.<br />
        <br />
        After graduating from Washington University in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering, Mr. MacMillan married the former Suzanne Medart. They were married for 49 years, rearing four children, before her death in 1992.<br />
        <br />
        While in college, Mr. MacMillan enrolled in the Civil Pilot Training program. He later enlisted in the Navy's Officer Candidate School and became a pilot. In World War II, Mr. MacMillan was a member of a night fighting squadron, flying off the aircraft carrier Enterprise. He was among the first to attack the principal islands of Japan and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross.<br />
        <br />
        After the war, Mr. MacMillan joined McDonnell Aircraft as a test pilot, later becoming the chief test pilot. He then joined the aeronautics and space divisions, where he was chosen project manager for the Mercury spacecraft.<br />
        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's publication on the history of Project Mercury says: &quot;When the prime contract for Mercury was awarded to McDonnell, the corporation's vice president for project management, David S. Lewis, assigned Logan T. MacMillan, a tall, tactful test pilot and mechanical engineer with a winning manner, to be companywide project manager with authority to mobilize the resources of the corporation for the new venture.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        McDonnell built 20 Mercury capsules, including Freedom 7, which carried Alan B. Shepard Jr. in America's first space flight in 1961, and Friendship 7, in which John Glenn Jr. circled the Earth three times in 1962.<br />
        <br />
        McDonnell Douglas Corp. was merged into the Boeing Co. in 1997. Lawrence Merritt, historian for Boeing in St. Louis, recalled Mr. MacMillan.<br />
        <br />
&quot;Logan was very popular, very well-spoken, very outgoing,&quot; Merritt said. &quot;In the 1950s, as chief test pilot, he would go out to local schools and give talks. In the early days of TV in St. Louis, Logan, because of his looks, was on television a lot. He looked like a test pilot was supposed to look.<br />
        <br />
        In his retirement, Mr. MacMillan joined other former executives in a Small Business Administration program that advised small and start-up businesses. He also enjoyed sailing, traveling and woodcarving.<br />
        <br />
        Among the survivors are two daughters, Mary Blaine Korff of Tucson, Ariz., and Susan Rien of Fair Oaks, Calif.; two sons, Douglas MacMillan of La Jolla and Logan MacMillan Jr. of Denver; and nine grandchildren.<br />
        <br />
      Mr. MacMillan will be interred Feb. 28 at Forever Oak Hill in Kirkwood. </p>

 Ed Lauer began his career with MAC in St. Louis in 1944.  He was in the Aircraft Propulsion Division in the early days and worked on experimental projects.  While working in St. Louis, he met  and married Skip Altemeyer who was a receptionist for MAC in the Ambassador Building downtown (St. Louis).  They met on the basketball court, both played in the Industrial League for MAC.  Skip was a 1946 Sky Queen at MAC (see the Retiree news page)<br />
Ed was involved in launch activities at Florida in the late 1940's and 50's.  Ed and Skip moved to Florida to work at the MDC facility in Titusville.  There he worked on many programs (Dragon, Tomahawk, etc) until he retired in August 1988, after 44 years of devoted service to MDC.  Ed passed away February 9, 1998,  <br />
Ed had a can-do attitude "if you can think it, you can do it" which inspired everyone around him. He later developed cancer from secondary smoke. Another attribute was his sense of humor. When the doctors couldn't stop the air leak in the remaining part of his lung, he and some of his teammates were thinking up fixes such as duct tape and gum.  He lived an exciting life and loved every minute of it -- his jobs, his family, his friends and teammates, and he thought Mr. Mac could walk on water. He was part of an elite group that helped to create a lot of firsts for our country and the world and for that his family is very proud and grateful. <br />
Ed's wife, Skip Lauer, provided this note.  Skip remains in Florida, and keeps in touch with her old friends and teammates.<br /></td>
