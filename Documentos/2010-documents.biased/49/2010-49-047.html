Information retrieval
</h1>
<br />
<p>
<strong>Information retrieval (IR)</strong>  is the science of searching for <a href="information_en.html" class="wlink">information</a> in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for <!-- CLK metadata_computing_en.html -->metadata<!-- LC --> which describe documents, or searching within <!-- CLK database_en.html -->database<!-- LC -->s, whether <a href="relational_database_en.html" class="wlink">relational</a> stand-alone databases or <a href="hypertext_en.html" class="wlink">hypertextually</a>-networked databases such as the <a href="world_wide_web_en.html" class="wlink">World Wide Web</a>. There is a common confusion, however, between data retrieval, <a href="document_retrieval_en.html" class="wlink">document retrieval</a>, information retrieval, and <a href="text_retrieval_en.html" class="wlink">text retrieval</a>, and each of these has its own bodies of literature, theory, praxis and technologies.

<p>
Automated IR systems are used to reduce <a href="information_overload_en.html" class="wlink">information overload</a>. Many universities and <a href="public_library_en.html" class="wlink">public libraries</a> use IR systems to provide access to books, journals, and other documents. IR systems are often related to object and query. Queries are formal statements of information needs that are put to an IR system by the user. An object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database. User queries are matched to objects stored in the database. A document is, therefore, a data object. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates. 
</p>

<p>
In 1992 the US Department of Defense, along with the <a href="national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_en.html" class="wlink">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST), cosponsored the <a href="text_retrieval_conference_en.html" class="wlink">Text Retrieval Conference</a> <strong>(TREC)</strong> as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for such a huge evaluation of text retrieval methodologies.

<a name="Performance_measures" id="Performance_measures"></a>
<h2>Performance measures</h2>


<p>
There are several measures on the performance of an information retrieval system. The measures rely on a collection of documents and a query for which the relevancy of the documents is known. All common measures described here assume binary relevancy: the document is either relevant or completely non-relevant. In practice queries may be <a href="ill-posed_en.html" class="wlink">ill-posed</a> and there may be different shades of relevancy. The formulas for precision, recall and fall-out are translated from the German Wikipedia-article <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_und_Precision" class="xlink">"Recall und Precision"</a>.
</p>


<a name="Precision" id="Precision"></a>
<h3>Precision</h3>


<p>
The proportion of retrieved <i>and</i> <a href="relevance_information_retrieval_en.html" class="wlink">relevant</a> documents to all the documents retrieved:
</p>



<p>
In <a href="binary_classification_en.html" class="wlink">binary classification</a>, precision is analogous to <a href="positive_predictive_value_en.html" class="wlink">positive predictive value</a>. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is <i>called precision at n</i> or <i>P@n</i>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the meaning and usage of "precision" in the field of Information Retrieval differs from the definition of <a href="accuracy_and_precision_en.html" class="wlink">accuracy and precision</a> within other branches of science and technology.
</p>


<a name="Recall" id="Recall"></a>
<h3>Recall</h3>
 

<p>
The proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all relevant documents available:
</p>



<p>
In binary classification, recall is called <a href="sensitivity_tests_en.html" class="wlink">sensitivity</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant document also, for example by computing the precision.
</p>


<a name="F-measure" id="F-measure"></a>
<h3>F-measure</h3>
 

<p>
The weighted <a href="harmonic_mean_en.html" class="wlink">harmonic mean</a> of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is:
</p>



<p>
This is also known as the  measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted.
</p>

<p>
The general formula for non-negative real α is:

</p>

<p>
Two other commonly used F measures are the  measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the  measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall.
</p>


<a name="Average_precision" id="Average_precision"></a>
<h3>Average precision</h3>


<p>
The precision and recall are based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. Average precision emphasizes returning more relevant documents earlier. It is average of precisions computed after truncating the list after each of the relevant documents in turn:
</p>

 

<p>
where <i>r</i> is the rank, <i>N</i> the number retrieved, <i>rel()</i> a binary function on the relevance of a given rank, and <i>P()</i> precision at a given cut-off rank.
</p>

<p>
If there are several queries with known relevancies available, the <i>mean average precision</i> is the mean value of the average precisions computed for each of the queries separately.
</p>


<a name="Model_types" id="Model_types"></a>
<h2>Model types</h2>

<p>

For successful IR, it is necessary to represent the documents in some way.  There are a number of models for this purpose. They can be categorized according to two dimensions like shown in the figure on the right: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model. (translated from <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informationsr%C3%BCckgewinnung#Klassifikation_von_Modellen_zur_Repr.C3.A4sentation_nat.C3.BCrlichsprachlicher_Dokumente" class="xlink">German entry</a>, original source <a href="http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&amp;lng=eng&amp;id=" class="xlink">Dominik Kuropka</a>)
</p>


<a name="First_dimension_mathematical_basis" id="First_dimension_mathematical_basis"></a>
<h3>First dimension: mathematical basis</h3>


<ul>
<li> <i>Set-theoretic Models</i> represent documents by sets. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:

<ul>
<li> <a href="standard_boolean_model_en.html" class="wlink">Standard Boolean model</a>
</li>

<li> <!-- CLK extended_boolean_model_en.html -->Extended Boolean model<!-- LC -->
</li>

<li> <!-- CLK fuzzy_retrieval_en.html -->fuzzy retrieval<!-- LC -->
</li></li></ul></ul>



<ul>
<li> <i>Algebraic Models</i> represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices or tuples. Those vectors, matrices or tuples are transformed by the use of a finite number of algebraic operations to a one-dimensional similarity measurement.

<ul>

</li>

<li> Latent semantic indexing aka <a href="latent_semantic_analysis_en.html" class="wlink">latent semantic analysis</a>
</li></li></ul></ul>



<ul>
<li> <i>Probabilistic Models</i> treat the process of document retrieval as a multistage random experiment. Similarities are thus represented as probabilities. Probabilistic theorems like the <a href="bayes_theorem_en.html" class="wlink">Bayes' theorem</a> are often used in these models.

<a name="Second_dimension_properties_of_the_model" id="Second_dimension_properties_of_the_model"></a>
<h3>Second dimension: properties of the model</h3>


<ul>
<li> <i>Models without term-interdependencies</i> treat different terms/words as not interdependent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the <a href="orthogonality_en.html" class="wlink">orthogonality</a> assumption of term vectors or in <!-- CLK probabilistic_model_en.html -->probabilistic model<!-- LC -->s by an <a href="independency_en.html" class="wlink">independency</a> assumption for term variables.
</li></ul>



<ul>
<li> <i>Models with immanent term interdependencies</i> allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by <!-- CLK dimensional_reduction_en.html -->dimensional reduction<!-- LC -->) from the <!-- CLK co-occurrence_en.html -->co-occurrence<!-- LC --> of those terms in the whole set of documents.
</li></ul>



<ul>
<li> <i>Models with transcendent term interdependencies</i> allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They relay an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example a human or sophisticated algorithms.)
