<p>So far Intel is not yet ready to impress the public with its 
new dual-core Conroe processor. So, the Presler with the new C1 core 
stepping overclocked to 3.73GHz steps in to represent the company in the market. 
Let??&#1074;„&#1118;s find out the exciting details from our new review]</p>

<P>Today, on March 22, Intel officially launched the new Pentium Extreme Edition 
965 working at 3.73GHz clock speed.</P>
<P>In fact there is nothing extremely interesting about the core clock speed 
increase of the Presler based processor. Especially, since we have already 
tested a Pentium 
Extreme Edition 955 overclocked to 4.26GHz. However, there is one small 
detail that makes us very interested in taking a closer look at the newcomer. 
The thing is that Pentium Extreme Edition 965 is the first CPU out there based 
on the new C1 Presler core stepping. So, looks like there will be some new 
announcements today.</P>
<H3><font color="#FF6600">Closer Look at Presler C1 Core Stepping(intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<P>As you know, the first Pentium D processors based on the new 65nm core were built on 
Presler B1 core stepping. Compared with the previous 90nm Smithfield core that 
was used in older Pentium D models, the new Presler has a lot of advantages. 
Among them we should first of all mention higher performance due to larger 
overall L2 cache memory that has been increased to 4MB (2MB for each core) and 
lower heat dissipation that has been reduced due to finer and more advanced 
manufacturing process. However, the first Presler based CPU owners revealed a 
few noticeable drawbacks. Presler B1 core stepping processors turned out to have 
no Demand Based Switching support, a set of technologies that proved to be very 
efficient in the older Intel processors. It means that Pentium D and Pentium 
Extreme Edition that belong to the 900-series do not support Enhanced HALT State 
and Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology. This is exactly why Intel 
was in such a hurry to convince the users that this drawback would be eliminated 
very soon: the new core stepping supporting all the above listed technologies 
was promised to come out in January a month after the first Presler processors 
came out.</P>
<P>The new Presler core stepping ??&#1074;&#1026;&#1114; C1 ??&#1074;&#1026;&#1114; first of all resolved the issue with 
power saving and power consumption technologies. Enhanced HALT State and 
Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology have been implemented in this core stepping 
and work without any trouble. However, these were far not the only improvements 
that the new core stepping has acquired.</P>
<P>The CPUs with the new core stepping received another great improvement. The 
new core stepping allowed Intel to reduce the heat dissipation of its dual-core 
processors. This was a very impressive reduction that allowed Intel to move its 
new C1 Presler processors into a completely different thermal category. The 
power envelope of the new Pentium D CPUs rated from 930 to 950 will be 
determined by the 2005 Mainstream FMB requirements (typical heat dissipation ??&#1074;&#1026;&#1114; 
95W). For your information, the previous modification of the Presler core 
belonged to the 2005 Performance FMB thermal envelope (typical heat dissipation 
??&#1074;&#1026;&#1114; 130W).</P>
<P>Of course, the top Presler models from the Pentium Extreme Edition family 
will still beloong to CPUs with 130W&nbsp;thermal envelope. However, it is important 
to understand that the ???typical heat dissipation??? parameter doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t have any 
direct relation to the practical heat dissipation. This parameter serves to 
define the requirements the processor sets for the mainboard voltage regulator 
circuitry and cooling system. In other words, the heat dissipation of the 
Pentium Extreme Edition on the C1 core stepping will also get lower, but not 
greatly enough for this processor to get into the pretty numerous 2005 
Mainstream FMB category.</P>
<P>It is important to point out that the introduction of the new Presler core 
stepping should not cause any compatibility issues. Presler processors with C1 
core stepping are fully pin-compatible with the previous core stepping CPUs. The 
maximum a user may need when shifting to a CPU with the new C1 core stepping is 
to reflash the mainboard BIOS. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, it is still too early to pronounce the mass availability of 
the CPUs with the new Presler core stepping. Pentium Extreme Edition 965 
supporting Demand Based Switching will arrive into the market on April 1, and 
the improved Pentium D from the 900-series should hit the shop shelves no sooner 
than by the end of next month.</P>
<P>It shouldn??&#1074;„&#1118;t be too difficult to distinguish between the new Pentium D 
processors with lower heat dissipation and their older brothers thanks to a 
slight change that has been made to the CPU marking. Presler processors with C1 
core stepping will carry the info about the 2005 Mainstream FMB category they 
belong to on the processor casing top: 05A.</P>

</TABLE>
<P>Just like the Pentium Extreme Edition 955, the newcomer requires the FSB 
frequency to be set at 266MHz. On the one hand it means that the nominal 
frequency multiplier of the Pentium Extreme Edition 965 equals 14x, but on the 
other it indicates that this processor sets the same requirements for the 
mainboards as the predecessor. As a result, the processor is guaranteed to be 
fully compatible only with the i975X based platforms. At the same time, there 
are quite a few mainboards in the market based on the earlier chipsets, such as 
i955/i945, that can unofficially support Pentium Extreme Edition 965.</P>
<P>Note that besides higher bus frequency, Pentium Extreme Edition 965 boasts 
one more very important feature that distinguishes it from the Pentium D CPUs. 
Namely, it supports Hyper-Threading technology. So, since Pentium Extreme 
Edition 965 is a dual-core processor, the system will see it as four logical 
CPUs.</P>
<P>Since this solution is based on C1 core stepping and supports Enhanced HALT 
State Technology, it can drop the working clock speed down if the processor is 
idle. The minimum clock frequency multiplier for Presler core is 12x, so the 
frequency of Pentium Extreme Edition 965 can drop down to 3.2GHz. Since Pentium 
Extreme Edition is targeted for computer enthusiasts, Intel decided not to 
activate Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology in it. However, this is 
only true for this particular model, and other Presler processors on C1 core 
stepping will support Demand Based Switching technologies set.</P>
<P>The current version of the diagnostic CPU-Z utility doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t yet know the 
Presler CPUs on C1 core stepping well enough.</P>

<P>Although this tool doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t recognize the new core stepping, you can still get 
it from the CPUID parameter that used to be F62 by the previous B1 cores 
stepping.</P>
<P>Note that the Pentium Extreme Edition engineering sample we had at our 
disposal had an unlocked clock frequency multiplier. This shouldn??&#1074;„&#1118;t surprise 
you, as all other processors from this extreme family boast the same feature.</P>
<H3><font color="#FF6600">Power Consumption and Heat Dissipation( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<P>As we have already mentioned above, one of the key features of the new core 
stepping should be the reduced heat dissipation and power consumption. Of 
course, we need to double-check this. For the corresponding experiments we 
decided to compare the power consumption of the new Pentium Extreme Edition 965 against the power 
consumption of the older Pentium Extreme Edition 955 processor based on the B1 
core stepping. In order to obtain correct results that could later be used for 
fair comparison, we overclocked Pentium Extreme Edition 955 up to 3.73GHz by 
raising its clock frequency multiplier. The Vcore remained unchanged in this 
case. This approach allowed us to compare the power consumption (and heat 
dissipation) of two Presler processors with different core steppings working in 
identical conditions. Note that Pentium Extreme Edition 965 processor worked 
with the Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology disabled.</P>
<P>As always, we used a special S&amp;M utility to measure the maximum power 
consumption (you can download this utility <A 
href="http://www.testmem.nm.ru/snm.htm" target=_blank>here</A> ). We measured 
the current that goes through the CPU power circuitry. So, the numbers given 
below do not take into account the efficiency of the CPU voltage regulator laid 
out on the mainboard.</P>
<P>Here are the results:</P>

</TABLE>
<P>These numbers are quite logical. Intel promised to reduce heat dissipation in the new 
core stepping and they did. Thus, Presler has become about 18% more economical 
in Burn mode, and got the power consumption reduced by about 30% in Idle mode 
when Enhanced HALT State technology kicks in. However, even though C1 core 
stepping has become much more economical, Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s dual-core processors will 
still not be able to compete against AMD??&#1074;„&#1118;s rivals here. The maximum heat 
dissipation of the dual-core AMD Athlon 64 X2 processors doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t exceed 100W, 
which remains an unattainable bar for Presler.</P>
<P>In addition to the picture we have just described, I would like to mention 
the processor temperature measurements taken with the regular boxed cooling 
installed:</P>

<P>Well, I don??&#1074;„&#1118;t think any comments are necessary here. You can clearly see that 
the boxed cooler can hardly cope with cooling down the older Presler revision 
overclocked to 3.73GHz. As for the Presler C1 core stepping, things look a way 
better here??&brvbar;</P>
<H3><font color="#FF6600">Overclocking( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<P>The impressive results of the previous test demonstrated that the new core of 
the Pentium D processors became ???cooler???. This gives us some hope that the 
frequency potential revealed during overclocking will also get better. However, 
we couldn??&#1074;„&#1118;t complain about the B1 Presler core stepping. During our tests of the 
Pentium Extreme Edition 955 we managed to overclock this CPU up to 4.26GHz with 
the regular air cooling only. This result was 25% higher than the nominal clock 
frequency of this CPU, which is a pretty impressive result for the top model in 
the family. But will the new C1 core stepping allow improving this result even 
more? Let??&#1074;„&#1118;s find out now.</P>
<P>Before we pass over to the detailed description of our overclocking 
experiments, we have to point out that the dual-core Pentium Extreme Edition 
processors remain quite overclocking-friendly solutions. Intel doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t lock 
their clock frequency multiplier that is why we can overclock these processors 
not only by raising their bus frequency, but also by increasing their clock 
multiplier. This not only makes overclocking a lot easier, but also partially 
justifies for the higher price of these products.</P>
<P>The test platform we assembled for our overclocking session was built around 
ASUS P5WD2-E Premium mainboard based on i975X chipset. The memory subsystem 
consisted of two Corsair CM2X1024-6400PRO memory modules. Besides that, the 
platform featured NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GT graphics card and Western Digital 
WD740GD HDD. </P>
<P>Note that we didn??&#1074;„&#1118;t aim at any extreme overclocking results. Therefore, we 
used a mass air cooler that is available at stores today - Zalman CNPS9500 LED. 
So, you should keep in mind that more advanced cooling systems may allow you to 
reach much higher overclocking results.</P>
<P>Our Pentium Extreme Edition 965 processor worked just fine at the frequencies 
up to 4GHz without any additional Vcore increase. </P>
<P>If we continue our overclocking experiments with the Vcore increase, the 
results will be even better. We have already said a few times that Presler based 
processors overclock very well by raising the core voltage. Therefore, we 
continued our overclocking experiments with higher Vcore settings of 1.375V. In 
this case we managed to increase the clock multiplier to 16x and achieve the 
4.26GHz frequency. Note that the processor was absolutely stable and didn??&#1074;„&#1118;t 
switch to thermal throttling.</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/cpu-4274.png" width="390" height="459" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<P>Further multiplier increase caused the complete loss of system stability. The 
same effect resulted from the FSB frequency increase over 270MHz. when the FSB 
speed was set between 267MHz and 270MHz, the system could still work fine, 
however, the ???hardest??? SnM and Prime95 tests would still cause some problems. 
So, we regard the 4.26GHz value as our final and maximum overclocking 
achievement.</P>
<P>Is it high or not? On the one hand, this frequency is 15% higher than the 
nominal frequency of the Pentium Extreme Edition 965 processor, and it indicates 
that this processor family hasn??&#1074;„&#1118;t yet exhausted its frequency potential. However 
on the other hand, we have already reached 4.26GHz when we experimented with 
Presler B1 core stepping processors before. And it means that despite all the 
enhancements of the C1 core stepping, such as lower heat dissipation, the 
frequency potential didn??&#1074;„&#1118;t grow any bigger. In other words, overclocker??&#1074;„&#1118;s 
shouldn??&#1074;„&#1118;t really hope for any breakthroughs to come with the new Intel CPUs on 
Presler C1 core stepping</P>
<H3><font color="#FF6600">Testbed and Methods( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<P>Since Pentium Extreme Edition 965 has now become the newest Intel product for 
hardware enthusiasts with unlimited budget, our goal today would be to compare 
its performance against its primary direct competitor. From the price 
prospective, this rival is none other but AMD Athlon 64 FX-60. So, we are going to pay special 
attention to this battle of the giants. And to make this test session even more 
exciting, we will also include the previous Pentium Extreme Edition 955 
processor model and the top Pentium D processor model with 950 rating.</P>
<P>So, we assembled a few test platforms from the following components:</P>

<H3><font color="#FF6600">Performance( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<H4>Synthetic Benchmarks: PCMark05, 3DMark06 and ScienceMark 2.0</H4>
<P>First of all we decided to test the performance of our processors in popular 
synthetic benchmarks.</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/pcmark.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<P>The popular PCMark05 benchmark demonstrates a slight advantage of the Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s 
newcomer over the AMD Athlon 64 FX-60 competitor. Here I would like to 
point out that the launch of Pentium Extreme Edition 965 changed the picture in 
this benchmark, as the AMD??&#1074;„&#1118;s processor for enthusiasts used to hit the highest 
score in PCMark05.</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/3dmark-1.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<P>3DMark06 results are very similar to what we have just seen on the previous 
diagram. The highest score again belongs to Pentium Extreme Edition 965, which 
outperforms Athlon 64 FX-60 in this test.</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/3dmark-2.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<p>The 3DMark06 total score depends a lot on the processor performance index that 
can be calculated from the processor speeds measured during game physics and AI 
calculations. So, there is nothing surprising about the leadership of the new 
Pentium Extreme Edition965 processor: its victory results from the highest score 
in the CPU test.</p>
<p><img src="../images/article29/sm2.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></p>
<p>The competitor solutions based on K8 architecture are definitely faster than the 
rivals in scientific computational tasks. According to ScienceMark 2.0, the 
performance of Athlon 64 FX-60 leaves Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s competitors far behind</p>
<h3><font color="#FF6600">General Performance( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></h3>
<P>We tested the general performance in office and digital content creation 
applications with the help of SYSMark 2004 SE benchmarking suite, which also 
uses multi-threading very actively</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/sysmark-1.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<P>During digital content creation the top dual-core AMD processor shows its best. It outperforms the new 
CPU from Intel, Pentium Extreme Edition 965, by about 4%.</P>
<P><img src="../images/article29/sysmark-2.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></P>
<p>However, in the office tasks the situation is completely different. Pentium 
Extreme Edition 965 working at 3.73GHz clock rate proves about 2.5% faster than 
Athlon 64 FX-60 working at 2.6GHz</p>
<h3><font color="#FF6600">Audio and Video Encoding</font><font color="#FF6600">( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></h3>

<p><img src="../images/article29/itunes.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></p>
<p>The results obtained during video and audio encoding are pretty curious. When we 
use a DivX codec, that has recently acquired multi-threading support, Pentium 
Extreme Edition 965 shows faster encoding speed. Thanks to the Hyper-Threading technology support that allows 
processing four computational threads simultaneously, it gets significantly 
ahead of the Athlon 64 FX-60. However, the results obtained from 
other codecs are not so inspiring for the Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s newcomer. For example, H.264 
format is getting more and more popular these days. So when we encode video into 
this format with Apple Quicktime, Pentium Extreme Edition 965 processor manages 
only to get even with Athlon 64 FX-60. And the translation of the sound files 
into mp3 format with Apple iTunes even gives the victory to the AMD CPU. So, we 
cannot state that any of the competing architectures - K8 or NetBurst ??&#1074;&#1026;&#1114; is more 
efficient for digital media content encoding tasks. Everything depends on the 
codec type and optimization.</p>
<h3><font color="#FF6600">Image and Video Processing( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></h3>

<p><img src="../images/article29/premiere.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></p>
<p>The results in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere make pretty much the same 
picture as in the previous case: the results are not in AMD??&#1074;„&#1118;s favor. If we 
compare the results of Pentium Extreme Edition with those obtained from Pentium 
D 950, we will be able to conclude that Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s solution for hardware 
enthusiasts can strengthen its positions here quite tangibly sue to 
Hyper-Threading support that is very important for these tasks. As a result, AMD Athlon 64 FX-60 cannot compete against the new 
Pentium Extreme Edition 965 here</p>
<p><b>3ds max 7</b></p>

<p><img src="../images/article29/3dsmax-2.png" width="450" height="222" border="0" alt="intel 965 CPU Review"></p>
<p>In 3ds max viewports the winner??&#1074;„&#1118;s laurels go to AMD Athlon 64 FX-60. It is about 14% faster than 
Pentium Extreme Edition 965. However, when it comes to final rendering, the 
picture changes to just the opposite: Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s top-of-the-line processor takes 
revenge and demonstrates higher results.</p>

<p>Frankly speaking, we didn??&#1074;„&#1118;t even hope that the new Pentium Extreme Edition 965 processor would win here. 
K8 architecture proves much more efficient in tasks of this kind than Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s 
NetBurst. As a result, even the higher clock speed of the new Presler based CPU failed to 
change the situation, that has been repeating from one test session to another. 
Note that despite this fact, Intel positions its Pentium Extreme Edition as a 
solution for extreme gaming fans. However, as we have just seen from the 
benchmark results, even the Pentium Extreme Edition 965 doesn??&#1074;„&#1118;t cope with the 
task well enough</p>
<H3><font color="#FF6600">Conclusion( intel 965 CPU Review )</font></H3>
<P>First of all I would like to stress that Pentium Extreme Edition and Pentium 
D processors will very soon all move to the new C1 core stepping. This will 
ensure some improvement of their features. Although the new core cannot boast 
higher overclocking potential, it still boasts two indisputable advantages: 
slightly lower heat dissipation and Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology support. 
Pentium Extreme Edition 965 is the first CPU based on the new core in our 
lab.</P>
<P>However, I don??&#1074;„&#1118;t think you discovered anything new and surprising about the 
new Pentium Extreme Edition 965 we have just reviewed, which is positioned at 
the top of the price list. The Presler core used in this processor simply got 
overclocked by another 266MHz, so that the new Pentium Extreme Edition 965 CPU 
features 3.73GHz nominal clock speed. This frequency alongside with the enabled 
Hyper-Threading Technology support helped the Intel??&#1074;„&#1118;s dual-core newcomer to 
improve its performance in many tests. At least now Pentium Extreme Edition 965 
wins in a much greater number of benchmarks. However, all these are the tasks 
dealing with image and video processing as well as final rendering, and are 
nothing like games. So, even though Pentium Extreme Edition 965 is positioned as 
an extreme gaming solution, it is very unlikely to win a lot of market here. 
Especially, since its performance-per-watt ratio is considerably worse than what 
the AMD Athlon 64 FX-60 has to offer. And this parameter has been turned into a 
primary CPU quality indicator lately.</P>
<P>So, Pentium Extreme Edition 965 will hardly affect the situation in the 
today??&#1074;„&#1118;s processor market. Everyone is already waiting impatiently on the new 
Intel CPUs aka Conroe that are due to the market in late summer. As a result, 
the launch of Pentium Extreme Edition 965 will hardly create any significant 
stir in the gaming enthusiast community.</P>
