<h3> &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody> </h3>

<p>
  &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody> were introduced in IE&nbsp;4, before the HTML&nbsp;4.0 specification
  was adopted. These tags were found useful and were adopted into HTML&nbsp;4.0. Since Netscape&nbsp;4
  predates IE&nbsp;4 and HTML&nbsp;4.0, Netscape&nbsp;4 and earlier do not recognize these tags.
</p><p>
  The idea behind these tags is to eventually support a <i>scrolling table</i>. Zero or more
  rows can be designated as heading rows, and zero or more can be designated as footing rows. The
  remaining rows are designated as the body of the table. The heading and/or footing rows would be
  displayed as fixed rows, while the body rows would be displayed between them in a scrollable area.
  As of yet, no browsers support scrollable tables, but the &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody> tags
  can be useful for other purposes.
</p><p>
  As you will recall, a table consists of rows (defined with &lt;tr>) that in turn consist of cells
  (defined with &lt;td> or &lt;th>). When you use &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody>, you place
  these around one or more rows like so:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  ...
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tfoot>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  ...
&lt;/tfoot>
&lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr> ... &lt;/tr>
  ...
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
</pre>

<p>
  When you use these tags, <i>all</i> of the rows should be placed within one of these
  tags. You can have at most one &lt;thead> (though it can contain more than one row),
  and it must appear first. You can have at most one &lt;tfoot>, and it must appear
  after &lt;thead> (if there is one) and <i>before</i> any &lt;tbody> tags. Finally
  are the &lt;tbody> tags. You can have more than one of these if you want to divide
  the body rows into more than one group. When we talk about frames and rules shortly,
  you'll see why you might want to do this.
</p><p>
  The reason for placing &lt;tfoot> before &lt;tbody> is that, if and when scrollable
  tables ever get supported, that the browser first encounter the fixed rows for the
  table. It can immediately display those before reading all of the rows for the
  scrollable part of the table. Unfortunately, this means that in browsers such as
  Netscape&nbsp;4 and earlier and IE&nbsp;3 and earlier, the header and footer rows
  are both displayed before the body rows. Largely for this reason, very little use
  has been made of &lt;tfoot> in most web pages today.
</p><p>
  Since no existing browsers support scrollable tables, simply including &lt;thead>,
  &lt;tfoot> and/or &lt;tbody> makes no difference to the appearance of the table.
  However, these tags do support the <tt>align</tt> and <tt>valign</tt> properties,
  and apply them to all cells within the row group. These can be used as attributes
  within the tag, or applied via CSS.
</p><p>
  IE also recognizes <tt>bgcolor</tt> in these tags, either as an attribute or as
  a CSS property. This is proprietary: HTML&nbsp;4.0 does NOT include background
  color for these tags either as an attribute or via CSS. Netscape&nbsp;6 does
  not support it.
</p><p>
  In general, it's better to place these attributes within the
  &lt;tr> tags rather than in &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody> so that they'll
  be recognized and acted on by browsers that don't recognize the newer tags.
  But if you have a number of rows within one of these tags and if you're not
  concerned whether Netscape&nbsp;4 and other browsers don't recognize the attributes,
  you can save coding by placing these in the &lt;thead>/&lt;tfoot>/&lt;tbody> tag
  rather than in each of the &lt;tr> tags.
</p>

<h3> Example </h3>

<p>
  Here's a table that includes one heading row, one footing row, and a set of body rows.
</p><p>
  CSS is used to specify background colors for the row groups. Note that IE supports this,
  but Netscape&nbsp;6 does not.
</p><p>
  CSS is used to apply <tt>text-align:&nbsp;center;</tt> to <tt>tfoot</tt>. Both IE and
  Netscape&nbsp;6 support this.
</p><p>
  If you can view this in Netscape&nbsp;4 or another browser that doesn't recognize the new tags, you'll
  see that the footing row appears <i>above</i> the body rows, and you'll see that none of the
  formatting attributes for the row groups are applied. In these older browsers,
  it's just as if the &lt;thead>, &lt;tfoot> and &lt;tbody> tags aren't even there.
