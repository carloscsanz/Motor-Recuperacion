years.<p>

<p>

	<b>Marc Abrams</b> of the Department of Computer Science attended SIGCOMM'96,

the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Communications,

Architectures and Protocols, in Stanford, Cal. SIGCOMM is the ACM's Special

and invited speakers; and "The Myth of the Scientific Method" at the Third

Annual Josephine L. Hopkins Foundation Workshop for Science Journalists at

Cornell University, similar to the Woods Hole workshops, but organized by the

Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. One of the participants was Lee

Edson, who spent several terms as science writer in residence at Virginia Tech

some years ago.<p>

the cover comments. "In Mayo's view, we learn about the world by being shrewd

inquisitors of error--by actively probing, manipulating, and simulating

patterns of error, and by deliberately introducing known patterns of error into

the collection and analysis of data....This book will be important for

philosophers and methodologists of science as well as for researchers in the

physical, biological, and social sciences."<p>

<i>International Handbook on Juvenile Justice,</i> published by Greenwood

Press. The book is a collection of original essays on the juvenile-justice

system in 19 countries, including the United States. Those countries represent

all inhabitable continents. Shoemaker co-authored the chapter on the

Philippines. The chapters are written in a standard format, which allows for

comparative assessments, and there are separate chapters on China, England, and

Use, Materialism and Mental Health Among Dutch Adolescents" at the annual

meetings of the Southern Sociological Society in Richmond.<p>

Guggenheim, MacArthur, and Mellon Foundations, as well as the National Science

Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. Fellows in residence at

the center work to increase "knowledge of the principles that govern human

behavior."<p>

<p>

	<b>Gretchen Adams-Shollenberger</b> of Personnel Services has had an article,
